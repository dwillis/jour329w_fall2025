    "content": "Ethics standards are good decision for Court\n\n August 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 675\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Those who suspect that Justice Samuel Alito views the Supreme Court as some imperial Star Chamber that is unaccountable to Congress, the public or anyone else have recently gained a powerful new ally in that theory: Alito himself.In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal's opinion section, Alito lashes out at the growing consensus that Congress should impose mandatory ethics standards on the justices, considering they refuse to do it themselves.\"No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court,\" he says. \"Period.\" Legal scholars and others have pounced on the assertion as just plain wrong, constitutionally. It's also a distressing confirmation of the anti-democratic instincts of a man who, with his fellow court conservatives, has lately wielded his unelected power in precedent-breaking, culture-transforming ways - regarding abortion rights in particular - that would never pass muster at the polling place.That comes against a backdrop of ethics concerns that have undermined the court's credibility lately, involving justices from both sides of its deep ideological divide.The details vary: Justices Clarence Thomas has accepted luxury trips and other perks from a prominent Republican donor; Justice Neil Gorsuch made a big real estate sale to a lawyer whose firm has business before the court; Justice Sonia Sotomayor's staff has prodded public institutions to buy her memoir.The justices for the most part have responded to the mini-scandals, if at all, by denying wrongdoing and/or saying they will be more careful going forward.Alito had a different approach when ProPublica was preparing to report in June that he had accepted private jet travel to a luxury fishing trip from a politically active billionaire: He preempted the story with a defiant Wall Street Journal op-ed making the tonedeaf argument that he had saved the taxpayers travel-security expenses by accepting the private ride.He insisted he technically had no legal obligation to disclose the trip, nor to recuse himself from cases before the court in which the billionaire was involved.The latter assertions are true, and that's the problem. Unlike every other judge in America, the court's nine justices aren't bound by a mandatory set of ethics standards regarding conflicts of interest and recusal.They have long asserted that they adhere to such standards voluntarily, so there is no need to officially impose them. For an answer to that assertion, re-read the preceding paragraphs.The issue has prompted movement in Congress to impose mandatory new ethics standards on the justices. Which in turn prompted Alito's claim, in the extensive Wall Street Journal interview, that the court is effectively untouchable by anybody. (One of the two writers of the coddling opinion piece, it discloses, is an attorney with a case pending before the court. You can't make this stuff up.)At first half-blush, it might make sense - surely the high court must be utterly independent from Congress to function, right? - but that ignores the entire concept of constitutional checks and balances between the three branches of government. The whole point of that concept is that no single branch holds unfettered power of the kind Alito appears to claim.As numerous legal scholars and other critics have pointed out in response to Alito's comments, Congress already requires financial disclosure of gifts and stock transactions from the justices.Congress also determines the size of the court, its budget (including the justices' pay), the dates of its sessions and other basic structural issues.Congress similarly imposes ethics standards, budgetary control and other power over the executive branch; the president, meanwhile, can veto actions of Congress. Alito hasn't questioned these and other checks and balances between the other two branches of government. It's only his own branch, apparently, that is untouchable.It's not. Congress should be cautious about overstepping its authority regarding the court, but mandatory ethics standards of the kind that govern other judges would be constitutionally defensible and could help restore public confidence in the court.If Alito is concerned that it would threaten a creeping loss of judicial independence, he should champion a move for the court to self-impose those standards.REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

    "content": "Time for DeSantis to rock and roll with Trump - COMMENTARY\n\n August 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A6 | Section: Opinions \n \n 564\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It's certainly about time for Ron DeSantis, who remains the main challenger to front-runner Donald Trump, to stop pulling his punches.On the campaign trail this week, responding to the latest indictment, DeSantis came closer than usual. In answer to a reporter's question, he actually acknowledged, \"All those theories that were put out did not prove to be true.\" In other words, they were false.In other words, the election was not stolen.How long will it take for him to come right out and say that?.And if the election wasn't stolen, what does that say about the effort to overturn it?.Storming the Capitol to overturn an election that wasn't stolen? What do you say about that? Based on \"theories that were put out (that) did not prove to be true.\" What is striking about DeSantis' move, however modest, is that it came on the same day as a new poll showing the race in Iowa to be closer than the nationwide contest, with DeSantis running second at 20% to Trump's 44%, still a double-digit lead but less commanding than in the national polls, where Trump enjoys majority support.This is according to the New York Times/Siena College poll of likely Iowa caucus participants. It suggests that DeSantis' efforts in Iowa are having at least some impact.Will he be willing to take on Trump's \"theories\" that did not \"prove to be true\" in the days ahead and actually hold him responsible for spreading lies?.And will that help him or hurt him with the voters, some of whom are currently leaning toward Trump, who he needs to persuade to win the Iowa caucus?.Obviously, from the care and the baby steps he has been taking, it is a difficult strategic dance for the Florida governor. He needs to win the support of Trump backers without losing his credibility entirely in the process.Of course the election was not stolen. Of course the claims of fraud were not true. The fact that we are even playing these games is a bit ridiculous in and of itself.But this is the dance for the nomination. Does it escape mention that Chris Christie, who has been the most outspoken of the Republican candidates in his criticism of Trump, does not break 1% in the Iowa poll?.One point to note from that survey: 67% of Iowa Republicans, when offered a choice, said they preferred a candidate who was focused on \"restoring law and order in our streets and at the border\" than one trained \"on defeating radical 'woke' ideology in our schools, media and culture,\" which sounds like Trump over DeSantis - or, rather, it sounds like Iowa isn't necessarily buying what DeSantis has been trying to sell.Which raises again the question of what he should be selling: likeability, for certain; electability, for certain; and maybe, as the key component to both of those, traits of character and integrity that used to be the stuff of presidential campaigns, what contests were said to be all about, the measure of the man - exactly the sort of measure that Donald Trump seeks to evade at all costs.When it comes right down to it, the question about election fraud is a question about integrity, and there is only one answer. The answer is integrity, and that is, ultimately, what DeSantis needs to demonstrate, and what he needs to sell. \n \n Caption: SUSAN ESTRICH \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trump could win presidency again; here's how\n\n August 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Byron York | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 913\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the past few days, we've seen a number of political analysts come to a momentous conclusion. Actually, two momentous conclusions.The first is that it is unlikely anyone can catch former President Donald Trump in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.The second is that it is entirely possible Trump, having won the GOP nomination, could go on to win the general election and become President Trump again.Yes, the analysts include all the necessary caveats - it's early, the situation is unprecedented, anything can happen, etc. But still: Sober observers are suggesting it's all over in the GOP primaries and game on in the general election.Their case was strengthened last week with the release of a new New York Times poll showing Trump \"leading his nearest challenger, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, by a landslide 37 percentage points nationally among the likely Republican primary electorate.\" Thirty-seven points is big, big, big. Other national polls have shown Trump with similar leads in the Republican race. The most recent surveys included in the RealClearPolitics average of polls have Trump ahead of DeSantis by, going backward in time, 36, 43, 44, 40, 32, 29 and 25 points.The first analysis comes from Politico with the headline, \"A DeSantis come-from-behind win is looking vanishingly unlikely.\" The report notes that, \"Only once has the Republican polling leader in midsummer of the year before the election gone on to lose the party's nomination.\" That person was Rudy Giuliani, who led the 2008 GOP race all through 2007, with a lead that sometimes stretched to 14 points, only to fall apart when the actual voting began in 2008. At the same time, in 2007, the John McCain campaign imploded, ran out of money and rebooted, with McCain somehow going on to win the nomination.That's the model, pretty much the only model, for a DeSantis comeback. And remember, Giuliani led the GOP race, according to the RealClearPolitics average of national polls, until January 2008. In today's terms, that would translate into Trump leading the GOP polls for five more months before fading. DeSantis, burdened by sinking polls and campaign difficulties, would then stage a McCain-style surge.It's possible, maybe.On the other hand, overcoming Giuliani's 14-point lead was one thing - especially after Giuliani made the disastrous mistake of de-emphasizing the Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina contests to focus on Florida. Overcoming Trump's 35-point lead in the RealClear-Politics average is quite another. \"No candidate has ever blown a national polling lead even a third as large as Trump's is today,\" Politico writes. \"A Trump collapse would be unprecedented.So, too, would a DeSantis turnaround.\" The second analysis is by CNN's Harry Enten, who takes the Politico assessment a step further.\"Trump is not only in a historically strong position for a nonincumbent to win the Republican nomination, but he is in a better position to win the general election than at any point during the 2020 cycle and almost at any point during the 2016 cycle,\" Enten writes.Enten suggests it is a little surprising that Trump is leading the Republican race, given everything that has happened.\"What should arguably be more amazing,\" he writes, \"is that despite most Americans agreeing that Trump's two indictments thus far were warranted, he remains competitive in a potential rematch with President Joe Biden.\" Enten notes recent polls that show Trump evenly matched with Biden or even ahead of the sitting president.\"To put that in perspective,\" Enten continues, \"Trump never led in a single national poll that met CNN's standards for publication for the entirety of the 2020 campaign. Biden was up by high single digits in the late summer of 2019. Biden is up by maybe a point in the average of all 2024 polls today.\" It was as if the political world, after months of deep, deep skepticism that Trump could prevail in a general election, threw open a door and said: Wow, Trump could win! The New York Times' Jonathan Swan, who has reported extensively on Trump's policy plans should he win the presidency again, tweeted, \"I can't tell you how many otherwise smart people have chastised us for going deep on what Trump and his allies plan for 2025 because 'he can't win a general election.' Pure wish casting.\" Indeed it is. Of course, it's time to repeat the caveats.The biggest caution is that this situation really is totally unprecedented. First, there has not been in living memory a former president who made a serious bid to win back the White House.Second, there has not been such a candidate who has run while facing multiple indictments, one of which is from the administration he seeks to defeat. By the end of next month, Trump could be facing four - not one, not two, not three, but four - indictments.So far, the charges have not only not lowered his poll ratings; they have actually raised them. But that could change when the reality of Trump's trials arrives.Or maybe it won't.What is entirely predictable is that if Trump were able to win the nomination and then the presidency again, the resistance that would result would make the Resistance of 2017-2021 seem sedate by comparison.\"A Trump election in 2024 quiets nothing,\" the former Republican-turned-Resistance writer David Frum tweeted recently. \"It's a formula for huge, indefinite, unlimited political crisis, more impeachments. Trump cannot 'win' his legal battles. He will only convulse the country in his effort to save himself.\" \n \n Caption: BYRON YORK.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS.\n \nFormer President Donald Trump speaks during a rally, Friday, July 7, in Council Bluffs, Iowa. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

How did we every reach such an abyss?The responsibility lies primarily with Trump himself but not entirely. He would not continue to be relevant without enablers. Those enablers include the populace who continue to support him in spite of his continued flaunting of legal and democratic norms but even more so the Republican leadership - which is more and more evolving into an oxymoron.It is very unfortunate that only seven Republican senators voted for impeachment on Feb, 13, 2001. If only 10 of the other 43 Republican senators had shown an equal measure of courage as the courageous seven, Trump would no longer be relevant and wouldn't that be a relief.RONALD GRIFFINMcDaniel \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He surrounds himself with vulnerable, less intelligent people who can be easily swayed into doing unethical, unlawful acts, to advance his cause.He is banking on the loyalty he demands from them while giving that same loyalty to no one.Hopefully, these co-conspirators of his, will see the light and tell the truth.Chances are, the Republican politicians who still support him, have nothing good to say about him, behind closed doors.They are afraid to stand up to him for one reason only: fear of losing votes which could mean loss of their seat and, therefore, loss of power. Although I'm no fan of Mike Pence, he finally spoke the truth about Jan 6, and for his trouble, has been threatened again with hanging and cries of traitor.How many in his base have sent money to this grifter? They might have thought, at one time, this money would help him get re-elected. It is now clear, that their hard-earned money is paying his myriad legal bills. He boasts of being incredibly wealthy, so why is he not dipping in to his own coffers to pay his legal bills? That is what the rest of us would have to do.This quivering pile of protoplasm, tried to stage a coup in this home of democracy. The founders of this country fought and died for our right to vote and established rules for a peaceful transfer of power.This idiot tried to destroy that, letting his minions storm the capitol, while he sat in the White House, watching it unfold.

Jackson Women's Health Organization overruling Roe v. Wade may be the best worst thing to happen to Democratic politics in recent years.It is moving voters, and if there was any doubt of that, look at the results in Ohio this week, where a thinly disguised referendum designed to make it more difficult to pass a constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights failed at the polls on Tuesday.Republicans had proposed an initiative to require a supermajority of 60% to amend the state Constitution - a special new requirement intended to make it more difficult to pass an abortion rights amendment come November.The biggest supporter of the initiative was the D.C. based Susan B.Anthony Pro-Life America.Voters smelled a rat - and turned out in record numbers to vote no. The amendment lost by 14 points in a state that Donald Trump carried by 8 points.We may not be as narrowly divided, not on every issue, not nearly as polarized, as the purveyors of fake news would have you believe.That bodes well for the efforts that began this week in another key state, where the effort is to place a constitutional amendment on abortion on the ballot in November 2024.The more states with abortion on the ballot in November 2024, the more the issue will drive votes to Joe Biden.This week, prochoice groups in Arizona announced that they had united and would begin a petition drive to collect enough signatures to put an amendment on the ballot in November 2024 protecting a woman's right to choose abortion prior to viability.The logic behind these efforts is simple and straightforward.Abortion drives votes. The polls are clear. Choice dominates.More than 60% of all Americans support Roe v. Wade. The Republican Party doesn't know how to deal with that without offending its base, which expects it to be proactive with a losing hand, a strategy that is doomed to failure.So it continues not only to fight losing battles against constitutional amendments proposed by pro-choice coalitions but also to engage in expensive and poorly conceived efforts like the one in Ohio, which was designed to circumvent the coming constitutional battle; Ohio is the only state with abortion on the ballot this November, and both sides have raised millions of dollars.The coalition supporting the Arizona initiative includes the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona, NARAL Arizona, Affirm Sexual and Reproductive Health, Arizona List and Healthcare Rising Arizona.Current law in Arizona bans most abortions after 15 weeks. The proposed amendment provides for a right to choose abortion prior to viability, typically 22-24 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for the life or health of the mother.The opposition is ready for a fight.In a statement, Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy told reporters, \"Our initial viewing of the measure reveals an extreme power grab by an industry that sees no limits to abortion.\" Maria Birnbaum, the Arizona state director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, told reporters the proposal was \"repugnant to the values of our state,\" because \"Arizonans believe in protecting the unborn and serving their mothers.\" The point is: If the coalition can collect enough signatures, the voters will decide. And they will be the same voters who will be choosing who Arizona sends to the Electoral College.In a statement released on Tuesday, Democratic Gov.

The ships can carry attack jets and other aircraft as well as amphibious landing craft, according to the Pentagon.The U.S. says Iranian forces have seized or attacked approximately 20 merchant vessels (including oil tankers and cargo ships since 2021. The harassments and seizures have occurred in the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman. The former is a \"chokepoint\" between the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea, a key shipping route (including for oil.)Last month, the Iranian navy attempted to illegally seize two merchant vessels in the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman, according to the Pentagon.U.S. and Iraqi defense officials also met in Washington on Tuesday as part of discussions about more long-term American support for Iraqi Security Forces. Iraq - which was invaded by the U.S. in 2003 and occupied until 2011 after the ouster of Saddam Hussein - is a longtime rival of Iran.A spokesman for the Iranian military said the country's naval forces are being equipped with missiles and drones in response to the increased the U.S. footprint, according to reports by Al Jazeera and Iran's state media.\"What do the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean have to do with America? What is your business being hereft,\" the spokesman said.Off the Alaska coast, the U.S. is responding to the Russian and Chinese navies exercises near the Aleutians. The U.S. has tense relations with both Moscow and Beijing over the former's invasion of Ukraine and the latter's saber-rattling with Taiwan and attempts to gain more control over the South China Sea.U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said the current and previous Russian and Chinese approaches to Alaska coast and Aleutian Islands, which were partially occupied by Japan during World War II, show the needed for a beefed up U.S.Navy presence. \n \n Caption: U.S. NAVY PHOTO BY MASS CO MMUNICAT ION SPECIALIST 3RD CLASS ALISHA GLEASON\n \nThe amphibious assault ship USS Bataan (LHD 5), left, and landing ship USS Carter Hall (LSD 50) have been deployed to the Persian Gulf as tensions with Iran heighten.\n \nHOGP\n \nIn this photo released Wednesday, Aug. 2, 2023, by Sepahnews of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the Guard's troops attend a drill on Abu Musa Island, in the Persian Gulf.

    "content": "Arms never should be an inducement to countries\n\n August 15, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom H. Hastings | Page: A7 | Section: News \n \n 1292\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When the U.S. gives arms to other nations, that is touted as diplomacy.If so, diplomacy needs a major makeover.In 1978, against all predictions of success, Jimmy Carter sought to bring peace to the Middle East and North Africa. Others had presumed to try and had miserably failed, with all manner of wars featuring Egypt and others attacking Israel or Israel attacking them.From 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, those nations seemed to jump into the buzzsaw of war more than once every 10 years.Carter sought, and got, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to join him at Camp David to see if they could manage to prevent the next war, at least between Egypt and Israel.Sadat hated Begin. Begin loathed Sadat. What could go wrong?Begin had a history as a terrorist.True. Against British officers, but also against random civilians in the area. He led the bombing plot that succeeded in killing many of them in the King David Hotel in 1946.If anything, that seemed to make him more attractive to Israelis, who saw that as part of their war of liberation, not a campaign of terror.Begin was a master of setting low expectations and promising little, while working hard to deliver more.He said he saw Carter's talks as just preliminary discussions toward when to have more detailed negotiations.Sadat was a more cosmopolitan, relaxed, fashionable leader, prepared to go big if it worked to the advantage of Egypt.Carter patiently worked with their teams for 13 days, staying there, not leaving in the sort of attention deficit disorder that plagued other American would-be deal brokers in the past and would again in the future.In the end, they succeeded and the peace between Israel and Egypt has held ever since. Sounds like a winwin, right?Not so much. There are longrange negative consequences to elements of the side deals that continue to this day and have cost many lives. It all relates to arms transfers - the sale or giving of weapons and munitions as diplomatic carrots.In the case of the vaunted Nobel Peace Prize-winning Camp David Accords, the malevolent aspect was the weapons aid Carter promised to both Israel and Egypt, aid the U.S. has kept up ever since, arming both countries and assuring that many innocent lives would be lost.With its advanced weapons from the U.S., Israel inflicts mass civilian damage on Palestine from time to time. For example, during Operation Cast Lead it killed more than 1,400 Palestinians, many of them children and other noncombatants, while Israel suffered only 13 mortalities, a 100:1 ratio that has been typical of such armed conflicts. That is structural violence at its worst.This is only possible because of the \"peace\" deal brokered by Jimmy Carter.Egypt had made the rights of Palestinians a trumpeted centerpiece of its deal at Camp David. I would assert that the results did not benefit Palestinians whatsoever.And Sadat may have been a bit liberal compared to Egyptian leaders before and since, but all the weaponry that Carter offered him to induce the success of the Camp David talks has been used to oppress people - especially Egyptians themselves - and to empower increasingly dictatorial Egyptian leaders. That oppression led to Arab Spring but Arab Spring was unraveled by the well-armed (by the U.S.)Egyptian military and now it is a military dictatorship.Perhaps Carter could not have foreseen those terrible outcomes of his efforts to bring peace to the region. But after this sort of thing plays out in the Middle East and North Africa, in Central Asia, in Colombia, and elsewhere, diplomats and other international negotiators should know better.We've been here again and again.Arms to Saudi Arabia to make them happy. Then they decimated Yemen, turning a poor country into the worst humanitarian crisis on earth, thanks to weapons and munitions marked Made In America. Meanwhile, U.S. humanitarian aid to Yemen, while helpful, is a snowball thrown into a hell created in part by U.S. arms sent to the region.Why does all this happen? Is it misplaced altruism?Oh, hell no. This is the arms industry, controlling State, controlling Congress, controlling it all the way to the U.S. presidency.The biggest obscenely profitable war profiteering corporations benefit enormously whether the U.S. sells weapons or gives them. It all means cost-plus, no-bid contracts for them.The enormity of the grift and the bloodshed is staggering. It's bipartisan.Trump bragged about his arms deals with Saudi Arabia, and Biden is quieter but doing the very same.Who pays for it?We do. U.S. taxpayers pay for every nickel in arms aid to Ukraine and many other countries, and it just means the war profiteers are rolling in profits that are reminiscent of what former Office of Management and Budget David Stockman meant when he told a reporter, \"The hogs are really feeding now.\" They are feeding off your elder health care.They are feeding off your student loans.They are feeding off your sketchy infrastructure.They take what is withheld from your income at paycheck time, and they divert it to war profiteers.And they are the ones most responsible for the ballooning federal debt and deficit. Congress can fuss all daylong over inane culture war issues that are less than a rounding error in the federal budget, but the real theft from all of us who work for a living is from the war profiteer corporations. Congress can pretend that Social Security and Medicare are making us impoverished but it is the contractor corporations who take more than anyone from our paychecks, quite literally.Only the American people can correct this. It will not be done by those we've elected so far, with some noteworthy exceptions. Change it up. Bring in those who are actually committed to fixing this.This is not naive. This is the new realpolitik.When American diplomats are dealing with trying to bring peace, they have much more than U.S. weaponry to offer. Much much more. They can offer humanitarian aid. They can offer increased refugee numbers accepted into our country.They can offer many opportunities to foreign students to study here or support for decent universities in the warring nations once they make peace. They can offer better trade terms. There are many carrots, many inducements.The sticks should be economic and reputational. For example, the U.S. might tell a belligerent nation to stick with the agreement you signed and you will gain, or if you don't you will be punished economically by the majority of countries and your reputation will suffer.In short, coercion is not limited to violence and arms never need to be any sort inducement. This should be a law. Congress? Come in, CongressSeriously, if it were a law we wouldn't waste our immense resources approving the $60 billion in military aid to Ukraine (so far).We would instead busy ourselves with finding those who can devise a solution through honest peace talks.This is how peace came to places like Liberia and to the Philippines.Other gains besides weaponry can bring the parties to agreement.The U.S. is the No. 1 supplier of weapons and munitions in the world. We are not helping by doing this. We are producing more death, more repression, more war. This can, and should, change.Tom H. Hastings is coordinator of conflict resolution degree programs and certificates at Portland State University, PeaceVoice senior editor, and on occasion, an expert witness for the defense of civil resisters in court. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nPresident Anwar Sadat of Egypt, right, and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin smile as they address the international press November 21, 1977, in Jerusalem.

    "date": "2023-08-17",

    "content": "GOP looks to regain control of California district\n\n August 17, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George F. Will | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 760\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. - In the 1960s, Orange County south of Los Angeles fascinated social scientists who, like anthropologists studying primitives, considered its residents exotic. The county gave Barry Goldwater 56 percent of its votes in the 1964 presidential election while he was winning just 38.5 percent nationally. In 1966, 72 percent of Orange County embraced a novice gubernatorial candidate, Ronald Reagan.In 1967, James Q. Wilson, the nation's preeminent political scientist (a Southern Californian, then at Harvard) explained in an essay for Commentary magazine, \"A Guide to Reagan Country: The Political Culture of Southern California,\" why Reaganism \"will be with us for a long time.\" The region's single-family dwellings (few apartments) and car culture (negligible public transportation) produced a property-centered, aspirational, individualistic orientation of life with \"intensely middle-class values.\" Times change, and Orange County certainly has. But Scott Baugh, the Republicans' probable congressional candidate in the 47th District, thinks a GOP revival will send him to Washington. National Republicans consider the 47th one of the most promising districts to flip from Democratic control. It is currently held by Democrat Katie Porter, who is running to replace Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein.Baugh, 61, was born on a Fourth of July, a good career move for a future state legislator, Republican Party official and perhaps congressman.With his granular knowledge of local demographics, he understands how Goldwater country evolved to elect the hyper-progressive Porter.Baugh says the two parties' registration percentages were about equal in 1978, but during Reagan's presidency \"you couldn't print registration forms fast enough to register Republicans.\" Baugh says Orange County's Republican registration reached high tide in 1991, with 55.6 percent of registered voters.The next year, Ross Perot's third-party presidential candidacy, an early symptom of coming populist fevers, won 23.9 percent of the county's votes. Today Orange is 33 percent Republican, 37.5 percent Democratic.In 1980, the county was 78.2 percent white (not counting people who declared mixed-race), 14.8 percent Hispanic, 4.1 percent Asian and 1.2 percent Black. Today it is 38 percent white and 23.3 percent Asian - partly the result of Vietnamese fleeing to America in the aftermath of a lost war. The 47th lost many Vietnamese when the district was reconfigured after the 2020 Census, but Baugh says it retains 31,223, plus 62,070 Chinese and 22,212 Koreans.The county's most politically portentous change - one replicated around the nation - is the growth of the city of Irvine, driven by the University of California campus there, and the biotech and other industries that cluster around research universities.The city's population has grown from 60,600 in 1980, to 141,200 in 2000, to 310,250 in 2022. In 2000, Republican registration in Irvine was 36,823 and in 2022 was 37,487, an increase of just 664 while the city's population was doubling, and Democratic registration increased 41,386.Recently, Politico reported that since 2000, of 171 communities designated \"college towns,\" 38 have transformed from red to blue: \"Name the flagship university - Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, among others - the story tends to be the same. If the surrounding county was a reliable source of Democratic votes in the past, it's a landslide county now.\" Porter came to UC-Irvine to teach law, and seven years later ran for Congress.Democrats have mastered the use of \"motor voter\" (voter registration of people acquiring driver's licenses) and universal mail voting to engage \"low propensity\" voters (who usually vote only in presidential years) and 0-for-4 voters (who have not voted in four consecutive elections).Orange County reflects not only the nation's dramatically increased diversity since the 1960s, but also today's crime issue, which might now be as salient as it was in the 1960s, when \"law and order,\" even more than the Vietnam War, propelled Richard M. Nixon into the presidency. Progressive reforms in California have reduced many felonies to misdemeanors, new bail policies require judges to release many of the accused, and the legislature has declared California a \"sanctuary state,\" so sheriffs cannot notify federal authorities when they release immigrants who are suspected felons. In Orange County's most affluent communities, Baugh says, law enforcement is instructing homeowners how to prevent burglars from disabling alarm systems by disabling a home's WiFi.Baugh, who lost to Porter by 3.4 percentage points in 2022, when he was outspent about 9 to 1, knows the GOP won't let such a spending disparity occur next year. Any margin of victory is apt to be close because this area is not exotic but normal, closely divided and reflecting the nation's political geology of fault lines along educational and cultural differences.George Will's email address is georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: GEORGE F.

But that's exactly what happened this week when he was charged by the Fulton County District Attorney under the Georgia version of the federal law that he used to brandish.It is a terrible fall for a once very proud man.What is so striking about it is that he had to know.Did he really think for one minute that Donald Trump had won the election?RICO punishes the enterprise and all those who are a part of it.Giuliani is charged with going out there and knowingly lying; indeed - this is the important point - he has already admitted to doing so in one of the civil proceedings against him in order to dispense with factual issues and focus on the legal ones. He has admitted that he lied about election workers tampering with ballots. He claimed they did.Not so. He now admits he lied about that.Why?He also lied about Dominion voter fraud and told tales of phony videos along with ballot theft.If Tucker Carlson knew better, didn't Giuliani? If Fox knew, he knew. If they acted with malice, what about him?Was he so desperate to be relevant?To be still the center of attention? Still part of the story?What if that is the real reason?What if it's all just really about ego, first and foremost, being the center of attention, being relevant, being important, being in the room, being at the table, being paid attention to, treated like someone who matters?In response to the indictment, Giuliani posted the following rejoinder on Twitter: \"This indictment is an affront to American Democracy and does permanent, irrevocable harm to our justice system. It's just the next chapter in a book of lies with the purpose of framing President Donald Trump and anyone willing to take on the ruling regime. They lied about Russian collusion, they lied about Joe Biden's foreign bribery scheme, and they lied about Hunter Biden's laptop hard drive proving 30 years of criminal activity. The real criminals here are the people who have brought this case forward both directly and indirectly.\" What planet is he on?Here is a man who was once hailed as a hero of law and order and is now facing time for participating in a wide-ranging criminal enterprise to overturn the democratic election in Georgia and across the nation.Here he is, in this case as a criminal defendant, and all the side talk about Hunter Biden and Ukraine will not cover up for his wrongdoing.Lying about stuffing ballot boxes.He was once on top of the world.He stooped as low as you could go.He was America's hero.No more. \n \n Caption: SUSAN ESTRICH\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nRudy Giuliani speaks with reporters as he departs the federal courthouse, May 19 in Washington. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

These sensitivities are rich. You don't own Christ's image. And you can't use the political process to impose your brand of Christian beliefs on the public and expect others not to see it as fair game for cartoonists.As a born-again Christian, I felt called to run for state Senate in 2018. Matthew 25 was my platform where Jesus says whatever you do for the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, those needing clothes, the sick and those in prison you do for Me.I was at my beautiful church, New St. John's in Wittman, and was called up at the last minute to read the new testament scripture and the lectionary reading happened to include that portion of Matthew 25.That settled the debate in my head about whether to run.Before I moved to the Eastern Shore in 2010, a friend and I had a nursing home ministry where we would visit six nursing homes to conduct worship and prayer services.Since coming here, I had a worship service in the Alzheimer's unit at the Pines for four years. I studied a year of clinical pastoral education and served as an on-call chaplain at the Easton Hospital.Today I visit the women in the Talbot County Detention Center.The shame today, of course, is that one party has been wrapping itself in the cloak of Christianity for the past decade, insisting our pluralistic country is a Christian country and promoting policies that exclude the LGBTQ+ community.They even insisted that restricting gatherings including church attendance during the early days of the pandemic was anti-Christian.Their efforts to impose an abortion ban is organized around certain faith-based communities.Our beautiful country is a pluralistic one.Churches, synagogues and mosques are simply human institutions and churches in particular have shrinking attendance. These Christians should develop a sense of humor and recognize that they can't play in the public square and not expect to be called out for it.HOLLY WRIGHTEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Argentinian proves to be a populist liberal\n\n August 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 822\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The media would like you to know that Javier Milei, the upstart candidate who improbably won Argentina's presidential primary this week, is a \"Trump admirer,\" \"rightwing populist,\" \"far-right outsider,\" \"far-right populist,\" \"rightist,\" \"far-right libertarian,\" a \"radical\" - and did they mention he's on the \"far right\"?Anyway, I'm no expert on Argentinian politics, so this coverage sparked my curiosity. And it turns out, Milei - also known as el Peluca (\"The Wig\") because he sports the hairstyle of a man spinning jazz-flute fusion records in his velvet-draped bachelor pad circa 1972 - is far more interesting than headlines would have us believe.An economist and rhetorical pugilist, Milei's philosophical outlook could more precisely be described as \"doctrinaire ultraliberal,\" (the good kind) as Andres Malamud of the Institute of Social Sciences of the University of Lisbon recently put it.That is news because it is an exceptionally rare outlook.Milei threatens to upend the political order in a country in the middle of another economic meltdown. Once-low poverty rates have exploded - some estimates put it at 43% - while the currency continues to lose its value.Milei, a longtime television personality, has made the case that Argentines are \"hostages\" to generationally destructive economic policy. (Interest rates were hiked to 118% this week.)He argues that politicians - or, as he calls them, \"rats\" of the \"parasitic, useless and useless political caste\" - have destroyed one of the richest countries in the world \"with nefarious ideas to line their pockets.\" Many of those ideas, Milei argues, can be found in Keynesian economics, which lies at the heart of most of Western society's ills. The candidate promises to shut down the central bank, dollarize the economy, deregulate markets, open up trade, cut taxes and pare the regulatory regime. Not incidentally, his English Mastiffs are named after Milton Friedman, Murray Rothbard and Robert Lucas.(Question: \"Is economics an exact science?\" Answer: \"No, because if it were, socialism would work.\") When Milei was asked if happiness was more important than liberty, he responded, \"They go hand in hand. You cannot be happy without being free.\" I'm skeptical that's the case for everyone. But Milei's placing of personal liberty as the prerequisite for not only a prosperous society but a virtuous one is welcome in a world where politicians increasingly look to bureaucracies, the welfare state and \"industrial policy\" to save us.In the United States, big-government conservatives like to complain that \"libertarians\" like Milei aren't equipped, or are unwilling, to take on social issues. Yet the candidate not only does so, he frames his defense as both a moral and liberal imperative.\"I am openly against abortion,\" Milei says. \"As a liberal I believe in unrestricted respect for others.You can choose over your body, but not over the body of the other.\" When asked why he wants to shut down government \"sex education\" programs, Milei referred to them as \"a mechanism\" of propaganda that destroys the family and \"comes down from the state with the intention of promoting everything that the line of the left and gender ideology has.\" While Milei has a Trumpian disdain for \"elites\" and engenders loyalty from his fans, the Argentine does not share the former president's adoration for state power and believes (rightly) that free markets offer a massive positive upside for the working and middle class.Milei has promised to raffle off his presidential paycheck, and 2.4 million Argentines have already registered to win $3,200 every month.\"To me, that is dirty money,\" he explained.\"From my philosophical point of view, the state is a criminal organization that is funded through taxes taken from people by force. We are giving back the money that the political caste has stolen.\" And along with rejecting climate alarmism as a destructive attack on modernity, he proposes an armed citizenry and calls for Argentina to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. (Both the United States and Israel, he says, are his \"natural allies.\") Into my veins, as the kids say.And what might seem surprising is that Milei's popularity is driven by younger voters. It is, of course, likely that part of that support is a protest vote against the failures of the Argentinian establishment rather than any ideological statement.Most ordinary people aren't \"doctrinaire\" about anything.Still, it shows that individual liberty - mocked as antiquated and puerile rhetoric by both right and left these days - can still have some currency.All this radical liberalism talk has prompted President Alberto Fernandez to warn that Milei is \"a threat to democracy\" and invoke Adolf Hitler and totalitarianism, as one always does. As far as I can tell, with authoritarian ideas gaining ground at an alarming rate, we could use more charismatic populist liberals like Milei.David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist.Follow him on Twitter@davidharsanyi.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n \n Caption: DAVID HARSANYI\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nJavier Milei, the presidential candidate of the Liberty Advances coalition, smiles at his campaign headquarters after polling stations closed during primary elections in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sunday, Aug. 13. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Latest Trump indictments not piling on\n\n August 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A6 | Section: Editorial \n \n 574\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Another week, another indictment.Americans can be forgiven for becoming numb to the still-astonishing fact that a former president and current presidential election frontrunner now faces four - count 'em, four - rafts of criminal charges from grand juries in New York, Florida, Washington and, now, Georgia.Georgia's indictment, announced late Monday, has drawn the usual breathless outrage from Trump's defenders in Congress.\"Disgraceful,\" declared Texas Sen.Ted Cruz, noting that America has \"never once indicted a former president\" before.True. But does it not occur to those who say this - as if it indicates unprecedented overreach by law enforcement - that it might instead indicate unprecedented criminality on Trump's part?\"The American people can decide whether they want him to be president or not\" without grand juries weighing in, fumed South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. \"This should be decided at the ballot box.\" Translation: No one running for president should be subject to the laws of the land, even if they tried to illegally overthrow a previous election.This would not be a wise legal standard.Trump's critics are often just as bad when it comes to drawing conclusions about charges that have yet to be adjudicated.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries issued a joint statement saying the four indictments together portray \"a pattern of criminal activity by the former president.\" Which sounds like they've already reached verdicts for the criminal juries.The two leaders' statement goes on to implore Trump's supporters and critics to \"allow the legal process to proceed without outside interference.\" It's advice they themselves should heed, along with other members of Congress in both parties.As an editorial board unencumbered by the duties of congressional leadership, we're comfortable voicing our view: Trump's scheme to overthrow the 2020 election plainly betrayed his oath to defend the Constitution in ways that merited his impeachment and should have merited removal from office. But whether those schemes rose to the level of criminality is debatable. That's what the juries have to decide.Which is how it should be. Merely being a former or aspiring president shouldn't shield anyone from facing criminal charges if there is evidence.That said, we have concerns about the Georgia indictment. It's so sweeping that, as Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus noted in an analysis, it appears to attempt to criminalize even Trump's bogus post-election speech declaring victory. This is dangerous ground. And it largely repeats allegations already raised in the earlier federal indictment regarding Trump's attempts to overthrow the election.Combined with the strong Florida indictment regarding Trump's mishandling of federal documents, and the more questionable New York indictment regarding Trump's pre-presidential hush money payments to a porn star, it all inevitably takes on the look of prosecutors piling on.Against that legitimate concern are some words to keep in mind: \"I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.\" \"So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes.\" \"Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.\" That's then-President Trump on Jan. 2, 2021, pressing Georgia officials to overturn Joe Biden's electoral victory in that state - to overturn democracy in order to keep himself in power.These multiple indictments on various allegations, some seemingly stronger than others, shouldn't be allowed to so muddy the waters that Americans forget what the most serious of these charges are all about.REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

    "content": "Mobsters, spies, anarchists, Klan members - and Trump - Prosecutors use racketeering, spy and Reconstruction laws in Trump criminal indictments\n\n August 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A2 | Section: News \n \n 911\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Former president Donald Trump has been charged like mobster and drug kingpin in Georgia, like an anarchist and foreign spy in Florida and like a post-Civil War Ku Klux Klan member in Washington D.C. as he faces now a quartet of criminal charges in the run-up to 2024 election.Trump was indicted by a Fulton County, Georgia grand jury along with 2024 campaign cohorts and attorneys - including Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows - over attempts to reverse President Joe Biden's 11,779-vote win in the Peach State.Part of that indictment includes racketeering charges conventionally used against organized crime syndicates and criminal gangs.\"The indictment alleges that rather than abide by Georgia's legal process for election challenges, the defendants engaged in a criminal racketeering enterprise to overturn Georgia's presidential election result,\" Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat, said during a late-night news conference Monday, Aug. 14, announcing the indictment of the former president and leading 2024 GOP White House candidate.The indictment includes RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations), making false statements and other election meddling charges. The criminal charges to making false statements, like some of other federal allegations against Trump, will face First Amendment free speech counterarguments.Across the U.S., RICO cases have commonly been used against organized crime syndicates and criminal gangs including John Gotti's Gambino Crime Family, the Hells Angels, Latin Kings and the Cowboy Mafia, which used shrimp boats to smuggle illegal marijuana in the late 1970. There have been RICO charges used in some corporate and other corruption cases including 2022 indictments of some current and former soccer officials associated with FIFA and CONCACAF.In Georgia, RICO convictions could potentially bring prison terms of 5 to 20 years.According to the Associated Press, the Trump indictment includes criminal charges related to \"attempting to persuade Georgia lawmakers to ignore the will of voters and appoint a new slate of electoral college electors favorable to Trump.\" \"In one particularly brazen episode, it also outlines a plot involving one of his lawyers to access voting machines in a rural Georgia county and steal data from a voting machine company,\" the AP writes.Like with his federal indictments and charges in New York of filing false business claims to cover up alleged hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model, Karen McDougal, Trump lambasted the charges as politically motivated falsehoods aimed to undermining his 2024 White House bid.\"Can you believe it? This failed District Attorney from Atlanta, Fani Willis, where murders and other violent crime soars daily to new record highs, is charging me with 2020 Presidential Election Interference. No, Fani, the only Election Interference was done by those that Rigged and Stole the Election,\" Trump said in a statement on social media platform Truth Social. \"Those are the ones you should be going after, not the innocent people that are fighting for Election Integrity!\" Ellis and Guiliani, who served as Trump campaign lawyers, say they are being charged criminally for providing legal advice. \"The Democrats and the Fulton County DA are criminalizing the practice of law,\" Ellis said in a social media statement.U.S. Justice Department Special Prosecutor Jack Smith has invoked federal grand juries in Florida and D.C. to indict Trump via the 1917 Espionage Act over his alleged misappropriation of classified documents and a post-Civil War law aimed at violent harassment by the Ku Klux Klan over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and efforts to derail Congress' certification of Biden as the 2020 election winner.The Espionage Act has been previously used against Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, Julius and Ethen Rosenbereg and early 20th Century anarchist writer Emma Goldman.All told, Trump, 77, could potentially be jailed for the rest of his life if convicted and sentenced aggressively by state and federal judges.Tung Yin, a law professor at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon, said jury selections will be very important in the cases against Trump and prospective jurors may hide their love, disdain or other views toward the former Republican president.\"That person might give very bland answers during jury selection,\" XXX said. \"It would be very hard to ferratt someone like this out. you get one person out of 12 you have a hung jury.\" The timing of the trials could run into and potentially after the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign elections.Yin sees the classified documents case where Trump is accused of improperly taking classified materials from the White House to his Florida estate as the stronger of the federal prosecutions.If convicted, Trump, the leading opposition candidate currently to President Biden, could potentially be jailed.For example, Jan. 6th charges in D.C. (which Biden won over Trump 92% to 5%) could result in Trump going to a federal prison for between 57 to 71 months, according to an estimate from Yin. That's between just under four and almost six years.Politically, as expected, Trump-aligned Republicans criticized the Georgia indictment while Democrats and progressives hailed the effort to convict and potentially imprison the bombastic populist former president. \n \n Caption: CHARLIE NEIBERGALL\n \nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump greets supporters at the Iowa Pork Producers tent during a visit to the Iowa State Fair, Saturday, Aug. 12, 2023, in Des Moines, Iowa.\n \nJOHN BAZEMORE\n \nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis speaks in the Fulton County Government Center during a news conference, Monday, Aug. 14, 2023, in Atlanta.

Having tried and failed 60 times in the courts to overturn the election he sought to use violence to do so. t doesn't take a criminal conviction to disqualify a former official from being allowed to again hold office. The disqualification is automatic. That is the legal opinion of Constitutional scholars who have written about the amendment.Trump should not be on the ballot in any state next year as a candidate for president.If the Constitution is not followed in this matter it means that we are no longer a Constitutional democracy.DAVID STEVENSCambridge \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Voters want issues, not Oprah in the debates\n\n August 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ann Coulter | Page: A7 | Section: News \n \n 640\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As the first Republican debate approaches, I have an urgent appeal to the candidates: Please adopt the good things Donald Trump did and skip the catastrophic parts (i.e., everything after the campaign ended on Nov. 8, 2016).Although he presided over the most wasted presidency in history, the 2016 Trump campaign was magnificent, without peer, perfect in every respect.I described the many useful innovations of that campaign in my book \"In Trump We Trust.\" Please start there, Republicans.President Trump may have been a pathetic crybaby too scared to fire his own attorney general - much less ask Speaker of the House Paul Ryan for wall funding - but in 2016, it was all image, and candidate Trump came across as strong.Quiz: Who is the greatest president of the last century? Answer: Ronald Reagan.You think he won because he had the nicest family?He wouldn't have been elected dogcatcher with that bunch. Yet somehow, Reagan won a 44-state landslide in 1980 and a 49-state landslide in 1984.His wife, Nancy, badgered him throughout his presidency to be pro-choice. Note that the crucial word in the previous sentence isn't \"pro-choice\" it's \"wife.\" Nancy hadn't been elected to anything. He ignored her - and went on to ignite an economic boom that lasted 30 years, defeat the Evil Empire and restore a nation in decline to its superpower status.But every four years, campaign consultants convince the candidates that voters are dying to hear about their families. Two for the price of one, to borrow an embarrassing slogan of the Clintons.Let's review some of the horrors from 2016: In addition to Sen. Marco Rubio's strange idea that having a bartender father was a crucial qualification for president, his typical opening statement went something like this: \"My name is Marco Rubio. I'm from Florida. My wife, Jeanette, and I are the proud - we've been married 17 years - and we're the proud parents of four children, two of whom were able to join us here this evening.\" (The other two were in bartender school.)Compare that to Trump's opening statement: \"I'm Donald Trump.I've made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all over the world, and I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals, we make our country rich again, we make it great again.\" Jimmy Carter's invocation of his daughter at the 1980 presidential debate was widely regarded as the reason he lost.Asked about nuclear treaties at the debate, Carter said: \"I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day before I came here to ask her what the most important issue was. She said she thought nuclear weaponry and the control of nuclear arms.\" (Her second-most important issue?Why Wendy Smith at school was so stuck up.)One week later, The New York Times began an article on Carter's sweeping defeat with this: \"Jimmy Carter almost had Leslie Fleisher's vote until she saw his debate with Ronald Reagan last Tuesday and heard Mr. Carter mention that his 13-year-old daughter, Amy, regarded nuclear weaponry as the most important issue. Then she decided to stay home.\" This humble pie crap began with Bill Clinton, who specifically requested that speakers at the 1992 Democratic National Convention tell stories of childhood deprivation (as documented by Ron Fournier, then of the Associated Press).The I-Feel-Your-Pain routine was a huge hit with urban liberals, but Clinton went on to lose the working-class vote. Not coincidentally, this was the precise moment the Democrats dumped the working class and became the party of Wall Street and welfare bums.Republican voters want issues, not Oprah.Candidates, we don't care if you were born a poor black child (Steve Martin, \"The Jerk\") or your wife is hell on wheels.

    "content": "GOP not there yet with articles of impeachment\n\n August 24, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Byron York | Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 782\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n There's a lot of talk among House Republicans about impeaching President Joe Biden. But GOP members disagree on whether there is enough evidence to go forward.On one hand, Republican investigators have made enormous progress in the past few weeks. The testimony of former Hunter Biden business partner Devon Archer demolished Joe Biden's claim that he didn't talk to his son about Hunter's shady foreign business deals.GOP lawmakers are also finding increasing evidence that foreign money flowed to multiple members of the Biden family close to Joe Biden himself.\"We have caught Joe Biden in so many lies,\" House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer told Fox News recently. \"I can't even count the number of lies now. So we have put together a case that I think would stand up in any court of law in America.\" Of course, no one is talking about criminal charges against the sitting president of the United States. Rather, if Republicans were to take action against Biden, it would be through impeachment.GOP House members have filed several resolutions of impeachment against Biden. Now there is a new one, the first since the Archer testimony, from a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Florida Republican Rep. Greg Steube. The resolution, containing four articles of impeachment, shows why the effort to impeach Biden is just not there yet.Article One attempts to link Joe Biden to Hunter Biden's, and brother James Biden's, influence peddling operations.The article says Hunter and James Biden \"sold access\" to then Vice President Joe Biden and then \"sold promised access\" to Joe Biden before he became president.Joe Biden himself \"assisted by making appearances, phone calls, meeting with business partners, and knowingly allowing his family members to promise access to him and actions by him in furtherance of these schemes.\" The Biden family, the article says, benefited financially from that; Joe Biden's role was an \"abuse of power\" and a violation of federal law.Article Two accuses Joe Biden of obstruction of justice, charging that the Biden Justice Department interfered with investigations into Hunter Biden's activities. The accusations are taken from two IRS whistleblowers who have outlined in detail how DOJ dragged its feet and actually blocked IRS investigators from looking into what appeared to be clear tax evasion by Hunter Biden.\"These acts constitute an abuse of power as well as obstruction of justice,\" the article says.Article Three accuses Joe Biden of fraud for a matter in which James Biden allegedly deceived investors in a health care company. \"Access to Joe Biden and indications that Joe Biden supported these schemes were used to lure investors into the schemes,\" the article says.Finally, Article Four accuses Joe Biden of \"financial involvement in drug and prostitution activities.\" The article says Joe Biden and Hunter Biden \"have a long history of comingled and intertwined finances.\" During the 2010s, Hunter Biden was famously blowing millions of dollars on drugs and prostitutes, both of which are illegal.\"Given the intermingled finances of Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, Joe Biden financially supported and should have been aware of these drug transactions and prostitution transactions,\" the article says. \"Many of these transactions would have occurred using accounts with a nexus to Joe Biden.\" So that is the current case against Joe Biden. The obvious weakness in all the articles is that they are based on an effort to tie Joe Biden to Hunter Biden's, or James Biden's, allegedly illegal activities. Republicans have made great progress in beginning to discover such links. They have shown that Joe Biden lied about his knowledge of Hunter's activities, which is an important breakthrough. There appears to be much left to be discovered.In addition, Republican have convincingly established that the Biden administration improperly interfered with investigation of Hunter Biden's activities. That is an important breakthrough, too, although there is much more to learn.So as far as the first two articles are concerned, there is good reason for Republicans to push forward with their investigation. The third article, about James Biden, is very iffy, and the fourth article, about Joe Biden's knowledge of Hunter's drugging and whoring, will never go anywhere.And that is the current state of efforts to impeach Joe Biden. Republicans do not yet have a convincing case for impeachment. Maybe they will get there, and maybe they won't. As far as exercising general restraint against taking the extreme measure of impeachment is concerned - well, that sort of restraint went out with Nancy Pelosi's leadership of the House. If Republicans do eventually gather enough evidence against Biden, they'll use it. But they don't have it yet.Byron York is chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner.COPYRIGHT 2023BYRON YORKDISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEELSYNDICA TION \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Voters need facts on abortion issue\n\n August 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 559\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Despite the looming shadow of the absent frontrunner, last week's Republican presidential primary debate did get into enough non-Donald Trump substance to establish that even the putatively mainstream part of the GOP field is still far out of line with mainstream America on major issues.Especially one that potentially affects half the population in the most intimate ways imaginable.On abortion, the grotesque, deeply misogynistic lie that legions of pregnant women are sitting around waiting until just before birth so they can maliciously abort their babies got wide airing with zero pushback from the candidates on the Milwaukee stage. (Or from the Fox News moderators, for that matter.)The related claim that President Joe Biden and other mainstream Democrats favor policies allowing abortion for any reason up until \"the moment of birth\" was also tossed around as if it was established fact instead of political slander.In fact, Biden and mainstream Democrats' support for abortion rights generally echoes what was enshrined in the now-defunct Roe v. Wade: protection of that right up until fetal viability, which by definition is not late-term abortion.\"Roe v. Wade got it right,\" Biden said earlier this year, going on to specify his support for restrictions in the final trimester.Polls show Americans agree. Gallup found in May that support for unfettered abortion rights in the first trimester (which is when the vast majority of abortions happen) was a record-high 69%.Further, all available data indicates that even in the most permissive states, late-term abortion almost never happens, and when it does, it is virtually always a dire medical emergency.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 91% of abortions occur in the first trimester - long before fetal viability.The fewer than 1% that occur in the third trimester are by definition medically complex and risky procedures that are virtually always the result of life-threatening medical emergencies for the woman or dire fetal abnormalities.But Wednesday's debate would have the nation believe this rare and tragic anomaly is commonplace and has widespread Democratic support.It's as towering a lie as any Trump has ever told (which is saying something), and they were all on board with it.This is a classic Republican strategy today, akin to other bogeymen like transgender athletes in high school sports and critical race theory in grade school classrooms: They take a phenomenon that is exceedingly rare or nonexistent, strip it of context, and cast it as an evil plot against the culture by liberals.The actual threat is far more real and was plainly visible on the Milwaukee stage last week.When former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the GOP needs to find political consensus on abortion policy, former Vice President Mike Pence pushed back, reiterating his call for a national ban and declaring that \"consensus is the opposite of leadership.\"If that sounds like, Never mind what the people want - well, that is, after all, the GOP's position in Missouri and other states that are fighting to prevent the issue from getting onto state ballots.That relentless strategy isn't about stopping a procedure that almost never occurs. It's about stopping women from having any say at all over what happens inside their own bodies. No matter which Republican wins the nomination, voters shouldn't forget that this is the party's overriding goal.REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

    "content": "Support of labor workers has shifted\n\n September 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 645\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It has been noted so often that it qualifies as a cliche, but this particular cliche, we would argue, is true: Today's Republican Party has been remarkably successful at building support from working-class Americans by loudly hammering at inflammatory culture-war issues - racial school curriculum, transgender care, \"wokeness\" - even as it quietly pursues an economic agenda that betrays those very workers.Less commonly noted but also true is that Democrats have bumbled their way onto the losing side of that equation. By any objective measure, Democratic economic policies are far more helpful to working Americans than Republican policies.Yet today's Democrats have managed to drive away their traditional base of blue-collar supporters by signaling at every turn that they don't respect them culturally.Labor Day this week is a good time to talk about how our policies and politics got so out of alignment when it comes to America's working people.A time traveler from the first half of the 20th century would find much about today's political landscape to be deeply puzzling, perhaps most of all as it relates to the working-class vote.Acknowledging up front that this has never been the monolithic thing the term suggests (tomes have been written on what, exactly, \"working class\" means), there's no question that the blue-collar base that bolstered Democrats from Franklin Roosevelt's time through the 1980s has largely migrated to the GOP today.By one narrow definition - voter income levels - Democrats have arguably become the party of the rich. Republicans now hold well over half the U.S.House seats in districts where the median income is below the national average, while Democrats hold almost two-thirds of the seats where median income is above that level.This is the proverbial coastal elites versus working-class Middle America.The fact that the GOP now has a solid hold on the latter is a seismic shift in our politics.Democrats' electoral losses in the Rust Belt, where they once dominated on the strength of pro-labor-rights voters, is especially stark, while Republicans have almost completely commandeered rural areas that used to be up for grabs. As political analyst Bruce Mehlman told Axios earlier this year: \"Republicans were the party of the country club, and they're increasingly the party of country.\" Political parties do shift over time in their platforms, policies and philosophies.The GOP was once the civil-rights party, after all, back when Democrats were the Jim Crow party.But what makes the Democrats' losses among working-class Americans today so notable is that there's no clear correlation to policy changes. Democrats today still are (as they have been for generations) the party of labor rights.Republicans, meanwhile, have been largely successful in gutting America's once-vibrant labor movement with its union-busting \"right to work\" legislation around the country.Then there is the GOP's stubborn opposition to minimum-wage increases.Consider, more broadly, what has happened to wages nationally in the past half century, in comparison to what has happened to the compensation of those workers' bosses.This is nothing less than a second Gilded Age, with wealth concentrated in a few hands and a political system that keeps it that way. Yet in the face of those numbers, the biggest Republican fiscal obsession of the past few years was the party's massive 2017 tax cut package, which primarily benefited corporations and their investors, threw peanuts to regular Americans and will ultimately add close to $2 trillion to the federal deficit, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.So as Labor Day fades away this week, this is the grim choice for America's workers: a Republican Party that talks the talk, a Democratic Party that walks the walk, but no party that can manage to do both. That doesn't require lectures to workers about who they should support but rather fundamental changes in the way both parties approach the people who keep America working.REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

    "content": "Proud Boys got the sentences they deserved\n\n September 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Susan Estrich | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the past two weeks, four of the leaders of the Proud Boys, who planned and executed the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, received long prison sentences - ranging from 10 years to 22 years in prison. Those sentences were denounced by two of the leading Republican candidates for president.On Tuesday, Vivek Ramaswamy, responding to the sentences, tweeted: \"This is wrong & it's sad that I'm the only candidate with the spine to say it.\" In a statement on Wednesday, he also promised to pardon all \"peaceful, nonviolent\" Jan. 6 participants and said, \"America now has a two-tiered justice system: Antifa and B.L.M. rioters roam free while peaceful Jan. 6 protesters are imprisoned without bail.\" Gov. Ron DeSantis took a similar tack in an interview with Newsmax on Wednesday, speaking of some of the protestors: \"They just walked into the Capitol. If they were B.L.M., they would not have been prosecuted.\" As for the others, \"they may have been violent, but to say it's an act of terrorism when it was basically a protest that devolved into a riot, to do excessive sentences - you can look at, OK, maybe they were guilty, but 22 years if other people that did other things got six months?\" Of course, Ramaswamy didn't point to any protestors being held without bail; the sentences he was reacting to were not for peaceful, nonviolent protestors, nor did DeSantis say who it was who got six months instead of 22 years. So much for the comparisons.Still, the argument that the justice system has treated the Jan. 6 protestors more harshly than the Black Lives Matter protestors is a familiar one. The problem with it is that it fails to distinguish between the mostly peaceful BLM protests and the violent assault on the Capitol, between an effort to interrupt the functioning of the government and nonviolent demonstrations.Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, rejected a selective prosecution argument from a Jan. 6 defendant who claimed he should receive a lenient sentence because armed protestors in Portland, Oregon, who protested at a federal courthouse were treated less harshly.\"The Portland rioters' conduct, while obviously serious, did not target a proceeding prescribed by the Constitution and established to ensure a peaceful transition of power.Nor did the Portland rioters, unlike those who assailed America's Capitol in 2021, make it past the buildings' outer defenses. The defendant has failed to point to any Portland case that is similar to this one and in which the government made a substantially different prosecutorial decision.\" The simple fact is that Jan. 6 was a more serious crime that deserves more serious punishment. The Proud Boys sought nothing less than the violent overthrow of the democratic process. DeSantis and Ramaswamy refuse to recognize that. It is not a minor crime. It is not comparable to a peaceful protest. It is not even comparable to a violent protest. It was an assault on our democracy.They were charged not with the sort of minor offenses that resulted in short prison terms handed out to the majority of other Jan. 6 protestors - who, according to various studies, received an average of 120 days in prison (compared to two years, the average for BLM protestors). The Proud Boy leaders were charged with a seditious conspiracy, defined as two or more people plotting to overthrow the federal government by force. If that isn't a serious crime, what is?They got the sentences they deserved for conduct that threatened the very heart of our democracy.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nRioters, including Dominic Pezzola, center with police shield, are confronted by U.S. Capitol Police officers outside the Senate Chamber inside the Capitol, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington.

Trump was the president that negotiated the terms of our withdrawal from Afghanistan, which included releasing 5,000-plus Taliban fighters being released back into the general population and a date certain for our withdrawal, which President Biden honored, while bringing our people home.\"How long will people be tied to one party that they would rather see our nation go down the tube\" You must be talking about members of the new Retrumplican party.Finally, \"If we continue in the direction that we are going, undermining our Constitution and Bill of Rights taking away our guns, closing our places of worship, giving us run away inflation, and forcing us to buy total electric.\" That sounds like Chicken Little, the sky is falling, the sky is falling, but it isn't, is it?WILLIAM KEPPENEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Perhaps Mr. Gondeck could send a picture of one. But that is trivial compared to his other completely false claims.No one has proved President Biden was involved in Hunter Biden's business dealings. President Biden has not \"invited\" undocumented migrants into the United States. \"Illegals\" (a horrible dehumanizing term used by Mr. Gondeck) do not get benefits. Biden did not aid our enemies in Afghanistan. Trump is the one that set the deadline for the pull out.The cities named in his letter are fun places to visit.Baltimore is neat, and they have good sports teams.Democrats do not want our county to go down the tubes. Democrats are not undermining the Constitution or the Bill of Rights, and they don't want your guns or want to close your places of worship or want inflation or want to make you use electricity. Indeed, Mr. Gondeck could shut off electricity to his house, and I could not care less.It would be easy for me, or anyone, to characterize Republicans as unethical, stupid, ignorant and disloyal to America, as Mr.Gondeck characterized Democrats.

And, while the former president technically has no role in the newly launched House impeachment inquiry against his once and probably future election opponent, that action is - make no mistake - all about fulfilling Trump's malicious vow.This kangaroo court has been convened not because there's one molecule of evidence that President Joe Biden has done anything impeachable, but because Trump's movement demands it of his most zealous followers in the U.S. House and their hostage er, speaker Kevin McCarthy.Though this is potentially the start of the third impeachment process America has seen in the past few years, it's dangerous new ground.Unlike the two impeachments during Trump's term, this inquiry is launched not in response to any actual evidence of wrongdoing, but in hopes of finding some. If that's the new standard, then every future president whose party doesn't control the House will govern under impeachment storm clouds.McCarthy on Tuesday ordered three House committees to begin inquiries based primarily on the shady international business dealings of the president's son, Hunter Biden, and the so-far baseless allegation that the elder Biden used his vice presidency to help him profit.They will also explore the claim that the administration pulled strings to get Hunter Biden his now-defunct plea deal with the Justice Department.Both issues are nonstarters. House Republicans earlier this year investigated for months seeking to tie the president to his son's sketchy business deals, yet were forced to issue a report in May acknowledging they found nothing.And the plea deal the Justice Department offered Hunter Biden (before it collapsed) was engineered by a Trump-appointed special prosecutor who Biden kept on the job at the behest of Trump's supporters. If that's a conspiracy, it's a pretty convoluted one.None of these facts will matter to Trump's hardcore partisans, whose argument is simple: Tit, meet tat.They are also immune to the irony of grasping at these ethical straws regarding Biden, while supporting an ex-president who openly profited from government business at his commercial properties throughout his term, and whose son-in-law leveraged his White House connections to raise billions in investments from the Saudis.Even the flimsy case against Bill Clinton, impeached for lying about sex, was more solid than the case at hand - because he actually did lie (about sex).Even those who claimed, straightfaced, that that merited Clinton's removal from office would have a hard time saying the same about someone guilty of being a weak parent to a wayward son. Which is ultimately all that President Biden is apparently guilty of.As the conservative commentator David French noted in The New York Times this week, the three previous presidential impeachment inquiries in modern times each began with concrete evidence of wrongdoing: Clinton's DNA on a blue dress, Trump's phone call to Ukraine's president demanding campaign help, and Trump's direction of a mob toward the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\"(A)t the risk of sounding crass,\" French asks, \"where is the blue dress\" in the current House impeachment case against Biden?There isn't one. The Republicans who are trying to pretend there is risk the same fate as Clinton's persecutors, who lost their House majority because Americans saw right through their cynical stunt.But the greater danger here is to the nation's political stability. As of now, America is in an era of impeachment inquiries launched with no more justification than is found on your average campaign bumper sticker.REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

    "content": "There's enough evidence for an impeachment inquiry\n\n September 15, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: David Harsanyi | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 836\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n \"Without evidence.\" They want those two words imprinted in your mind whenever you hear about the House impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. \"Since gaining the House majority in January,\" writes the Associated Press, \"House Republicans have aggressively investigated Biden and his son, claiming without evidence that they engaged in an influence peddling scheme.\" Many other pieces use the same language.Sticking the words \"without evidence\" into a story is meant to insinuate that the impetus for an investigation is itself meritless. What kind of people make accusations without evidence, right? But, as they know, inquiries exist for the purpose of uncovering evidence.Then again, there already exists tons of substantive proof that Joe Biden was likely \"engaged\" in the family racket. Now, it goes without saying that without the Biden last name, there is no Biden Inc. But numerous witnesses, many with no connection to one another or political agendas, have independently testified that he was involved.Let's start with the IRS whistleblowers charged with investigating Hunter Biden's tax case, who testified under oath that Joe was present in at least one meeting with Hunter's foreign clients.In numerous private emails and texts and WhatsApp messages he never imagined would be made public, Hunter talks about his dad not only helping him secure payments but taking a cut for himself.Hunter's former business partner contends that Joe was involved.Another of Hunter's partners, who is also a former close friend, maintained under oath that Joe spoke to Hunter's associates at least 24 times, often being dialed in on the phone during business meetings. An FBI informant documented conversations that indicated to him that Joe pressured foreign companies to send millions to the family business.And listen, I get that Democrats want us to believe it was just crazy happenstance that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor who happened to be investigating a company that was paying his son $1 million a year. But if the vice president knew the two were in business - and since he had a sit down with Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi, it is highly likely he did - then his actions were a corrupt conflict of interest, at the very least.That's also all evidence.Yet, Democrats want to create new evidentiary standards for both congressional investigations and for impeachment. No, Joe didn't need to commit a crime to be impeached. We know this from the first Trump impeachment.And, no, Biden didn't need to directly benefit from his family's corrupt business ventures to be corrupt.If one of the most powerful people in the United States government allows or participates in a scheme to trade on his power to make millions for his family (or deliberately gives the impression that he's willing to do so), it may or may not be illegal, but it is clearly unethical.Money, incidentally, is fungible.Just because a shady Ukrainian isn't writing \"re: Joe Biden influence trading\" on the memo line of a check doesn't mean the president didn't benefit.Perhaps further inquiry into the 20 shell companies and dozens of bank accounts, or the 5,000 emails in which Joe used pseudonyms to converse with Hunter and presumably others - all of it completely normal stuff for an above-board family business, right? - will provide some answers.Now, obviously there are partisan dimensions to an impeachment.And obviously some people overstate the existing case against the president. But let's not forget that Joe Biden has been lying about his knowledge of Hunter's \"work\" for years. If the president's relationship with Hunter was entirely separate and innocent - a product of their love - why does Joe feel compelled to lie?Whatever the case, standards have suddenly changed. Recall that Democrats claimed without evidence for years that Donald Trump was a Russian asset. To say there is more evidence of Biden's wrongdoing than was offered in any story connected to Trump-Russia collusion, a hysteria based on leaks, anonymous sources and fictitious works of political opposition, is to dramatically understate the matter.Take Rep. Adam Schiff, who famously claimed not only to have uncovered a criminal conspiracy by Trump's 2016 campaign but also to be in personal possession of smoking-gun \"direct evidence.\" I have gone through dozens of pieces related to Schiff's declaration, and not one reporter writes that the California congressmen did so \"without evidence\" - or anything approaching that kind of wording. Not in the text, much less in a headline.If the legacy political media were doing their job defending \"democracy,\" outlets would be deploying teams of crack journalists to track down leads and find out if there is any evidence related to Biden's wrongdoing, as they did with Trump, rather than playing defense for the most powerful man in the world.David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist.

    "content": "History should be kind to Romney\n\n September 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 6 | Section: Opinions \n \n 593\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After a long and remarkable political career that included a governorship in one state, a U.S. Senate seat in another and a presidential nomination, Mitt Romney will likely be most remembered by history for one thing: his vote to convict then-President Donald Trump after his first impeachment, for trying to strong-arm campaign help from Ukraine's government.It was the first time in America's history that any senator has taken such a stand against a president of his own party - and then he did it again, after Trump's second impeachment, for fomenting the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.Romney's retirement announcement last week, coupled with the release of excerpts from an upcoming biography, offered brutal judgment of his fellow elected Republicans for enabling Trump - including some choice words for Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley.It's unlikely that any Trump fans will be moved to self-reflection by the words of a man who embodies the vanquished normalcy and decency of their party - two qualities for which the MAGA movement has no use. But any Republican who has not yet been lost down that rabbit hole should fairly consider Romney's assessment of today's GOP.Romney's exit when his term as a Utah's junior senator ends in January 2025 will be the turning of a page: He is arguably the last prominent national figure from the old Republican establishment who neither left office during the Trumpification of the party in 2016 nor sold his political soul to stay.Romney said his decision to retire was based largely on his age. But at 76, he's younger than Trump or President Joe Biden, the presidential frontrunners for their respective parties next year.You have to wonder if there was more to it, in light of the dismay and disgust Romney expresses toward his party in the forthcoming biography, according to excerpts posted by The Atlantic last week.\"A very large portion of my party,\" Romney told biographer McKay Coppins, \"really doesn't believe in the Constitution.\" That's not exactly a startling revelation, given that a large portion of the party continues to support Trump despite his suggestion last year that that sacred document should be suspended in order to return him to office. But reading that judgment from the party's 2012 presidential nominee is nonetheless jolting.Regarding Hawley, Romney pays him a backhanded compliment, calling him \"one of the smartest people in the Senate, if not the smartest\" - too smart, Romney says, to actually believe the election-fraud nonsense he promoted that helped spark the Jan. 6 melee.Hawley and fellow Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Romney says, were \"making a calculation\" that \"put politics above the interests of liberal democracy and the Constitution.\" Obviously. But, still.Romney's biography offers another obvious truism that is nonetheless good to see confirmed on the record: The bulk of GOP officials who publicly scrape and bow before Trump are privately contemptuous of his norm-destroying antics.\"You're lucky,\" Romney says Republican leader Sen. Mitch McConnell told him, because \"you can say the things that we all think.\" Has there ever been a more blunt admission of political cowardice?Another colleague noted that Trump \"has none of the qualities you would want in a president, and all of the qualities you wouldn't.\" \"Almost without exception,\" Romney says, his fellow top Republicans \"shared my view of the president\" - not a good one.Romney isn't blameless, having helped legitimize Trump at various times in the past. But if his cleareyed diagnosis now of the Trumpian cancer eating at his party from within convinces other Republicans to demand a cure, history will be kind, indeed.REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

Whatever House Republicans come up with is nearly certain to be rejected by the Senate, where Democrats and most Republicans want to fund the government.In one dramatic sign of defeat Tuesday, House Republicans were even voting against their own defense bill. During a rowdy afternoon vote, the usually popular bill was turned back from consideration, 212-214, after five hard-right conservatives helped sink it. They want to see an overall plan from McCarthy.McCarthy simply walked off the House floor. \"Look, the one thing you're going to learn about me: I like a challenge - I don't like this big a challenge - but we're just gonna keep doing it until we can make it,\" McCarthy told reporters.With time dwindling, Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to pass the broader government funding legislation and get a bill to President Joe Biden's desk to become law.Otherwise, the U.S. faces massive federal government closures and disruptions. Plans for another vote Tuesday to advance the overall spending bill were shelved.\"The ball's in Kevin's court,\" said Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of the Freedom Caucus.The latest House government funding proposal, a compromise between members of the hard-right Freedom Caucus and the more pragmatic Main Street conservatives, was almost dead on arrival, left sputtering even after McCarthy loaded it up with spending cuts and Republican priorities in a border security package.Behind closed doors Tuesday, the speaker was trying to stress the political repercussions of a government shutdown to Republicans, warning them that no party wins with a closure.Unlike last week when an angry and frustrated McCarthy unleashed foul language on his colleagues, he tried a different tack when addressing his members privately in the Capitol basement.Appearing cool, calm and collected, McCarthy cast the funding plan as just a proposal and left time for rank-and-file members to debate, according to Republicans familiar with the meeting.Still, one Republican after another rose to tell McCarthy that the current plan would not have their votes. With a slim majority, he needs almost every Republican on board.Rep. Stephanie Bice, R-Okla., one of the negotiators for the Main Street group, urged her colleagues later to not let the \"perfect be the enemy of the good.\" The showdown over the usually popular defense bill shows the difficulty ahead - it was the second time McCarthy had tried to advance the measure after he abruptly withdrew it from consideration last week.The attempt to soothe tensions among Republicans comes as tempers are flaring and as big personalities try to seize the upper hand - some trying to lead and others hoping to disrupt any plans for compromise.Florida's two leading conservatives, Matt Gaetz and newcomer Byron Donalds, are sniping in the halls and across social media, as Gaetz criticizes the deal Donalds and others struck as insufficiently conservative. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Paying terrorists billions is nothing to brag about\n\n September 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: David Harsanyi | Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 829\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The going rate for an American hostage these days is around $1.3 billion.That's what the Biden administration paid out for five Americans in a prisoner swap with the Islamic Republic of Iran this week. And with little overhead, it's mostly profit for the mullahs.But don't let the term \"prisoner swap\" insinuate that there is any moral equivalence.These are not two normal countries trading spies or combatants. No, this is just old-fashioned extortion.The Iranians released political hostages, snatched off the streets of Tehran after unwisely returning to visit family or attending funerals or protests. Many of them were reportedly thrown into the notorious Evin Prison for the crime of having dual citizenship. Some, like Siamak Namazi, were put in solitary confinement for over two years.Conversely, the United States released a bunch of spies, most of them caught trying to send military and nuclear equipment back to Iran - all of them given the benefit of due process.Having a moral imperative to retrieve American citizens from these fascist regimes is admirable. Incentivizing more kidnappings is not. So, it's one thing for the Biden administration to contend, \"we did what he had to do\" and quite another for them to celebrate as if they had just signed the Peace of Westphalia.On Tuesday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan tweeted out a triumphant picture of the Biden team and the released hostages, writing, \"seven Americans on their way home from Iran alongside a world class group of American diplomats.\" The fact that Iran, a far weaker state with little leverage, walks away with its spies and $6 billion in sanctioned cash in exchange for five innocent people does not strike me as a great diplomatic coup at least not for the United States.Mullahs, and others, feel quite comfortable taking American hostages, which speaks poorly of our world standing, and confounding of the Democrats' soft touch with Iran.\"Hey, that's a nice military base you have there, it would be a shame if it ended up like the shredded corpse of Qasem Soleimani,\" is what the vile mullahs should be hearing. The same Democrats who are gung-ho to fight proxy wars against nuclear powers will almost never utter a word that might offend the supreme leader of Iran.Secretary of State Antony Blinken, trying to manage the political fallout, contends that the United States is \"working every single day to take steps to make this practice (hostage taking) more and more difficult and more and more of a burden on those countries that engage in it.\" They say the same thing every time. And it is never true.For a long time, stated U.S. policy was to never pay ransom for hostages taken by terror groups. The Justice Department objected to former President Barack Obama's midnight cash payments to Iran because it ignored those existing guidelines.This is why Washington now uses diplomatic euphemisms like \"wrongfully detained\" rather than \"hostage.\" And the U.S. not only still considers Iran a state sponsor of terrorism but it has designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the group that reportedly seized these very people we just liberated, a terror organization.Which is also why the White House claims that \"under terms that provide confidence, the funds will be spent only on a limited category of humanitarian trade: food, medicine and agricultural products. That's it.\" Is it, though? There is absolutely no way to ensure that the Islamofascists in Qatar, the nation \"brokering\" the deal, will hold their friends in Iran accountable, or that it even matters. Before all the funds were even transferred to Iranian accounts, \"President\" Ebrahim Raisi had told NBC News that his country would spend $6 billion \"wherever we need it.\" Of course, even if the mullahs bought only \"food, medicine and agricultural products\" with it, that specific money is, as everyone knows, fungible.Iran boosters will tell you the ransom money is actually Iran's to begin with - funds held by South Korea due to American sanctions. It shouldn't be. The Iranian government, companies and officials still owe American citizens at least $53 billion in outstanding judgments. Legislation passed in 2015 granted up to $4.44 million to every American held hostage by Iran in 1981 - $10,000 per day. Then there are the families and relatives of 9/11 victims, who also won tens of millions in judgments against Iran, which not only gave safe harbor to Sunni terror groups but also helped transit al-Qaeda members out of Afghanistan before 9/11, including some of the hijackers.Maybe we needed to make this deal, maybe not. But giving another $6 billion to a nation that attacks U.S. interests around the world, one that is responsible for the murders of hundreds of our soldiers, is nothing to brag about.David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist.

Republicans, under the leadership of House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, were determined to turn what should have been a routine oversight hearing into a cross-examination of Garland over the prosecution of former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden's son Hunter.Garland would have none of it.He stood for principle - the principle being the independence of the U.S.Department of Justice. As it should be.\"Our job is not to take orders from the president, from Congress, or from anyone else, about who or what to criminally investigate,\" Garland said. \"As the president himself has said, and I reaffirm here today: I am not the president's lawyer. I will add that I am not Congress' prosecutor.The Justice Department works for the American people.\"What does that mean? It means that Garland appoints special counsels and allows them to do their jobs.In Hunter Biden's case, the prosecutor in charge is David Weiss, a Trump appointee who has been leading the investigation and last month was, at his request, designated as special counsel to give him expanded powers.How he uses them, Garland made clear, is up to him. In his confirmation hearings, the attorney general promised not to interfere with Weiss' ongoing investigation of the president's son.\"I have kept that promise. The way to not interfere is to not investigate an investigation.\"That answer led one Republican on the committee to call for the attorney general to be held in contempt of Congress.The attorney general took the same tack when attacked for the indictments secured by Jack Smith, the special counsel he appointed to investigate Trump.\"No one has told me to indict. And in this case, the decision to indict was made by the special counsel.\"\"Singling out individual career public servants who are just doing their jobs is dangerous - particularly at a time of increased threats to the safety of public servants and their families. We will not be intimidated. We will do our jobs free from outside influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"If Republicans thought they could intimidate the attorney general, they don't know Merrick Garland. I've known him since law school - we were good friends - and he is not only a brilliant lawyer but a man of principle. At one point in the hearing, when accused of religious discrimination, he shot back: \"The idea that someone with my family background (his family fled the Holocaust) would discriminate against any religion is so outrageous - absurd.\"The oversight hearing, which in \"normal\" times would have focused on issues of policy, criminal justice and the like, this time, according to Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, was intended to \"examine how the Justice Department has become politicized and weaponized under the leadership of Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland.\"To the great frustration of Republicans, Garland refused to take that bait, just as he has protected his prosecutors from political interference. Indeed, the irony is that it is Trump who is running on a platform of consolidating all power - including the power to control the Justice Department and federal agencies - in the hands of the president. It is Trump who wants (and, as president, tried) to politicize the Justice Department; that is what he means when he talks about undermining the \"deep state.\"Garland was selected by Biden because of his reputation as a principled leader who would restore the tradition of an independent Justice Department.And that is what he has done. Whether the Republicans like it or not. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The headline is of his post is: \"It's Official! The Democrats Have a Nonwhite Voter Problem. The data can no longer be denied.\"What makes this post especially noteworthy is that Teixeira is the coauthor of \"The Emerging Democratic Majority\" a book that suggested that demography was destiny for the Democratic Party.It suggested that by extrapolating demographic trends, the total number of nonwhite voters in America would eventually make up nearly a quarter of the electorate.It further suggested if these voters voted solidly Democratic, they would provide a formidable advantage for Democratic candidates, especially, but not limited to Democratic presidential candidates.As a result, it predicted the Democratic Party could dominate American politics for the foreseeable future.The key words are: if these voters voted solidly Democratic.Recently polling of nonwhite voters suggests they are not likely to vote solidly Democratic in the 2024 presidential election and perhaps beyond.A recent survey conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and the American Enterprise Institute's Survey Center on American Life reports the following: 57% of nonwhite voters say President Biden has accomplished little or nothing during his time in office.Close to 50% consider the Democratic Party too extreme, think it bases decisions more on politics than common sense and supports policies that interfere too much in people's lives.Over two-fifths do not see the Democrats as sharing their values. And over a third think Democrats look down on people like them, do not value hard work and aren't patriotic.In The Liberal Patriot's recent survey of American voters conducted by You-Gov, most nonwhite voters believe the Democratic Party has moved too far left on both economic and cultural/social issues. On economic issues, 57% of these voters say Democrats have moved too far left.On cultural and social issues, 56% say the same.All these numbers lead one to ask what is next? It all depends on if or how the Republican Party and the Democratic Party adjust their election strategies going forward.Democrats could win back support from disgruntled nonwhite and select disgruntled white voters with two strategies. The first is addressing a growing perception by nonwhite voters that their longtime and solid support of Democratic candidates has been and is taken for granted. The second is embracing more moderate positions and actions on a wide range of economic and social issues.Republicans could recruit and retain support from disgruntled nonwhite voters with two strategies. The first strategy is addressing a perception that the GOP is an exclusive club that does not understand or care about nonwhite voters. The second is working more effectively on engaging, energizing, and mobilizing nonwhite voters whose views are in sync with Republican positions and actions on public policy issues to vote Republican.For both parties, pursuing these strategies has significant risks. Democrats risk alienating younger progressives who by nature are resistant to compromise and who are a steadily growing number of voters within the Democratic Party.Republicans risk alienating older conservatives who by nature are resistant to change like expanded voter outreach and get out the vote efforts with nonwhite voters.Between now and November 2024 it will be interesting to see if or how each party (assuming no third parties are viable) may maximize their opportunities and minimize their risks to accomplish the two goals of every political party - win elections and then govern in such a way to avoid the consequences of \"buyer's remorse\" in subsequent elections. \n \n Caption: Recently polling of nonwhite voters suggests they are not likely to vote solidly Democratic in the 2024 presidential election and perhaps beyond. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The House is expected to launch an evening vote on a package of bills to fund parts of the government, but it's not at all clear that McCarthy has the support needed as holdouts demand steeper spending cuts.\"It's easy,\" McCarthy quipped Tuesday when asked about keeping the government open.But with just five days to go before Saturday's deadline, the Senate is trying to stave off a federal closure as the hard-right flank seizes control of the House. Senators unveiled a bipartisan stopgap measure to keep offices funded for temporarily, through Nov. 17, to buy time for Congress to finish its work.The 79-page Senate bill would fund the government at current levels and include about $6 billion supplemental funding for Ukraine and $6 billion in U.S. disaster assistance that has been in jeopardy. It also includes an extension of Federal Aviation Administration provisions expiring Saturday.Ahead of a test vote Tuesday evening, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the temporary measure from the Senate \"a bridge towards cooperation and away from extremism.\"With a supportive nod, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell appeared on board with the bipartisan Senate plan saying, \"Government shutdowns are bad news.\"A government shutdown would disrupt the U.S. economy and the lives of millions of Americans who work for the government or rely on federal services - from the military personnel and air traffic controllers who would be asked to work without pay to some 7 million people in the Women, Infants and Children program, including half the babies born in the U.S., who could lose access to nutritional benefits, according to the White House.The standoff comes against the backdrop of the 2024 elections as a core group of hard-right Republicans are being egged on by Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner to challenge President Joe Biden, who has urged McCarthy's House to stand firm in the fight or \"shut it down.\"It is setting up a splitscreen later this week as House Republicans hold their first Biden impeachment inquiry hearing probing the business dealings of his son, Hunter Biden, as Congress spirals closer to a shutdown. It also comes as former Trump officials are floating their own plans to slash government and the federal workforce if the former president retakes the White House.Against the mounting chaos, Biden warned the Republican conservatives off their hard-line tactics, saying funding the federal government is \"one of the most basic fundamental responsibilities of Congress.\"Biden implored the House Republicans not to renege on the debt deal he struck earlier this year with McCarthy, which set the federal government funding levels and was signed into law after approval by both the House and the Senate.\"We made a deal, we shook hands, and said this is what we're going to do. Now, they're reneging on the deal,\" Biden said late Monday.But Trump is pushing Republicans to dismantle the deal with Biden. \"Unless you get everything, shut it down!\" Trump wrote in all capital letters on social media. \"It's time Republicans learned how to fight!\" The Republican speaker McCarthy brushed off Trump's influence as just a negotiating tactic, even as the far-right plan keeps torpedoing his plans.McCarthy arrived at the Capitol after a tumultuous week in which a handful of hard-right Republicans torpedoed his latest plans to advance a usually popular defense funding bill. They brought the chamber to a standstill, and leaders sent lawmakers home for the weekend with no endgame in sight.McCarthy, of California, was hopeful the latest plan on a package of four bills, to fund Defense, Homeland Security, Agriculture, and State and Foreign Operations, would kickstart the process.At the same time, McCarthy was also reviving his plan for the Republicans to pass their own stopgap measure even though a handful on the hard-right said they would never vote for it, denying him a majority. That proposal would fund the government while also adding severe border security provisions that Biden, Democrats, and even some Republicans reject.\"I'm working all my time to make sure that there would not be a shutdown,\" McCarthy insisted Tuesday. \n \n Caption: Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is surrounded by reporters looking for updates on plans to fund the government and avert a shutdown, at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, Sept. 22. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "U.S. faces alarming 'problems without passports'\n\n September 28, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 750\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - The man with the most interesting job in government receives a daily diet of information so potentially abundant, and often alarming, that it must challenge his phlegmatic disposition. William J. Burns, 67, the first career diplomat to serve as CIA director, is calm in the eye of the unending storm of international crises, which involves what he called, at a July conference in England, \"problems without passports,\" including pandemics.Hostile potential uses of biotechnology, including engineered viruses, are, Burns thinks, \"among the scariest things.\" Malign actors surely noticed the enormous self-inflicted costs - monetary and cultural - that U.S. policies imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. Cyber vulnerabilities suggest that destruction on a scale that used to be assigned to fleets of bombers can now be done with computer clicks: In 1995, a rogue trader for Barings Bank inadvertently destroyed the 233-year old institution.Imagine what can be done intentionally to physical (electric grids, communications systems, hospitals, etc.) as well as financial infrastructure.Oxford-educated and seasoned by foreign-policy immersion that began in the Reagan administration, Burns served as the ambassador to Moscow (2005-2008), where he got to know Vladimir Putin. In November 2021, when the U.S. intelligence community clearly saw Russia's preparations for invading Ukraine, Burns went to Moscow and spoke with Putin.The CIA director was alarmed when he went, and more so when he left Moscow convinced of Putin's \"tragic and brutish fixation\" on Ukraine, a fixation unaltered by \"the clarity of our understanding of what he was planning.\" Putin's invasion has been, Burns says, a strategic blunder with Russia's \"military weaknesses laid bare; its economy badly damaged for years to come; its future as a junior partner and economic colony of China being shaped by Putin's mistakes; its revanchist ambitions blunted by a NATO which has only grown bigger and stronger.\" Putin thought his window of opportunity regarding Ukraine was closing. Chinese President Xi Jinping, contemplating what he might think is an opening regarding the seizure of Taiwan, is surely watching what Burns calls Ukraine's \"breathtaking determination and resolve\" - and the possible weakening of U.S. support for Ukraine.On the CIA's leafy Northern Virginia campus, the agency has a large cadre of analysts debating whether, for example, the world has passed \"peak China\" - the apogee of China's might. Or whether there is any historical precedent for a rapid military buildup comparable to China's that has not been followed by war. A perennial intelligence problem is to decide how a nation's intentions can be inferred from the capabilities it develops.Today, the agency's remit extends to helping the Commerce Department understand the security implications of globalization's thick web of supply chains. We are, Burns says, in a \"plastic moment,\" when much is in flux.Intelligence successes often are secret because they concern crises prevented, and/or because publicity would reveal espionage sources and methods. Known successes - e.g., Navy codebreakers turned the tide of the Pacific war in the battle of Midway during World War II - are fewer than the known failures (Pearl Harbor, Bay of Pigs, Iraq's nonexistent weapons of mass destruction). About the CIA's limited ability to explain itself, Burns is laconic: \"It comes with the territory.\" Cambridge University historian Calder Walton, in his new book \"Spies: The Epic Intelligence War Between East and West,\" says there was a time when \"the CIA was so bereft of intelligence on China that it resorted to buying fish and chips in Hong Kong, to read the newspapers from the mainland they were wrapped in.\" In many ways, technology - \"smart cities,\" facial recognition, people using smartphones - can make societies more transparent and more porous to outside influences.We are, Burns says, in a \"profound transformation of espionage tradecraft\": \"We recently used social media - our first video post to Telegram, in fact - to let brave Russians know how to contact us safely on the dark web. We had 2.5 million views in the first week.\" There are and always will be, however, \"secrets we need a human to collect, and clandestine operations that only a human can execute\": \"That requires intensive training, an intensive team effort to support operations, and immense creativity and appetite for risk. It still, however, remains central to our mission.\" This is good to know. It would be a loss to literature were the intelligence-gathering wonders wrought by technology to totally supplant the derring-do that made Eric Ambler and John le Carré possible.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: GEORGE F.

It would be helpful for the Star to provide bylines for OpEds with political themes. In this case, it would show that David Reel is the former chairman of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee.This OpEd is characteristic of what I call the post 2016 American Enterprise sandwich. The American Enterprise Institute is the longtime conservative redoubt that has employed the likes of Newt Gingrich and Dinesh D'Souza.In off-year elections, the party not in the White House characteristically does very, very well. In 2016, the Republican Party let their extreme Donald Trump flag fly with disappointing results including the continuing speaker of the House fiasco and legislative stalemate because of the Republican Party's slimmest of majorities.The American Enterprise sandwich is a way for the conservative fringe to further itself with the veneer of non-combative moderation. The sandwich opens with a seemingly nonpartisan theme, in this case challenges and opportunities for Democrats and Republicans in addressing the African American electorate.The meat follows with opinion and statistics which are negative for the Democratic Party. The final section contains platitudes about listening to the electorate.Any piece dealing with how the Republican Party relates to the African American electorate that does not include the nationwide voter suppression efforts targeting that community cannot be taken seriously.In the case of David Reel's OpEd, it is not only in the style of the American Enterprise sandwich, but all the opinion is from American Enterprise staff and all the data is from American Enterprise surveys.Be on the look out for this type of opinion piece and remember that Donald Trump is overwhelmingly favored to be the presidential candidate for the Republican Party in 2024. Donald Trump is an existential threat to our democracy, and any attempts to distract from that reality should be ignored.HOLLY WRIGHTEastonDo more, with moreQuality education is the foundation of any flourishing society. As diversity, equity and inclusion get forced into everyday life by small groups around America, what happened to education?Groups are trying to measure equity and inclusion but seem to be totally ignoring the measurement of our schools and student performance.One recent report cited 13 public schools in Baltimore with less than 5% of students passing math and reading at grade level. How are voters not horrified and ashamed?Our governor is at public events for the arts and everything else under the sun but what has been offered to measure concrete improvements to our school, teacher and student performance? Has anyone in government or the Department of Education set a performance milestone to address this total failure. How can anyone so blatantly ignore these failing grades.There are the parades and protests supporting just about any cause or whim but not for education.Just a thought: How about our governor and the Board of Education and teachers union commit that 50% of Baltimore students will pass reading and math at grade level before the next election in 2026. 50% is still embarrassingly poor but it would be a start. (70% in the other state school districts.)Do any tax paying or voting citizens think 50% is too big of a job for our leaders? Would our teachers themselves accept a failure rate of 50%? Apparently so and for years. These results were here before COVID-19, and the money has been available for many years. Look at how much has been spent per student in our Baltimore public schools compared to the much more successful schools around the country.Clearly, money in Maryland is not the problem. Do more, with more. Accountability.We need measurable commitments from Gov. Moore and the dducation department followed by results before the next election cycle. We need to stop hiding from this clear failure of our youth and present the voting public with a plan to enforce measurement results.We are anxiously waiting.RICH ADRIANEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Using 14th Amendment to bar Trump won't work\n\n September 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 798\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Mae West (1893-1980), a salty actress, once played a character who said that when facing a choice between two evils, she opted for the one she hadn't tried before.A 2024 presidential choice between today's incumbent and his immediate predecessor would preclude West's cheerful strategy: Both have been tried, and together have produced a whopping bipartisan majority eager to see the last of them.This partly explains the spreading flirtation with the idea that the 14th Amendment bars Donald Trump from seeking the presidency.Many advocates of this idea are academics eager to infect presidential politics with the cancel culture of their campuses: Do not refute your adversaries, ban them. Less nakedly partisan people might think that using the 14th Amendment to remove Trump would thereby prompt President Biden to totter off into the sunset. But recourse to the amendment would be lawlessness masquerading as legality.And there already is a surfeit of illegality.The 14th Amendment, passed by Congress 14 months after Appomattox and ratified by the states 25 months later, is among the nation's most majestic accomplishments. Properly understood (by Randy E. Barnett and Evan D. Bernick in \"The Original Meaning of the 14th Amendment: Its Letter and Spirit\") and properly construed by courts (which it has never fully been), its Section 1 envelops the rights (\"privileges or immunities\") of civil equality in national citizenship with \"due process\" and \"equal protection\" guarantees.But people who would wield the amendment to extinguish Trump's electoral career are trying to solve a political problem by cleverness, citing the amendment's Section 3. It says that no person may \"hold any office, civil or military, under the United States\" who, having taken an oath as \"an officer of the United States\" to \"support the Constitution,\" has subsequently \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\"Leave aside (as a court will be unable to do) the fraught questions about what causal connections there were between Trump's rhetoric before and on Jan. 6, 2021, and the actions then of his acolytes: They, after all, had agency. And never mind how to calibrate \"aid or comfort.\" Just concentrate on \"insurrection.\"The Confederacy - the attempted secessions of 11 states; rebel cannon firing on federal installations; armies on the march against U.S. forces - was unambiguously an insurrection. A riotous rabble - whatever its motivations and delusional aspirations - on a January afternoon? Rather less so. They were criminal and disgusting, but closer to vandals than to the Army of Northern Virginia.Arguments about the continuing force and sweep of Section 3 are interesting; unleavened by prudence, they are dangerous. There could be no surer way to further embitter and calcify Trump's supporters than to stretch constitutional language to eliminate an electoral choice. And, in the process, to preempt judicial determinations about the nature and legal status of Trump's Jan. 6 behavior.People can find other outlets for their justifiable concerns about legalities. For example:Peter Navarro, former Trump adviser, has been properly convicted of contempt of Congress for defying a congressional subpoena. If unpunished, such behavior could largely nullify Congress's powers of investigation and oversight. Progressives pleased by this were, however, not noticeably offended when (the Wall Street Journal remembers) Barack Obama's Justice Department refused to prosecute Lois Lerner, who used her IRS position to impede conservative advocacy organizations, and for her noncooperation was held in contempt by the Republican-controlled House.Today, progressives' silence conveys complacency about Julie Su's imminent illegality. She is wielding power as Biden's labor secretary, even though the Democratic-controlled Senate has not confirmed her (at least 51 senators seem opposed). The Vacancies Act limits to 210 days the time someone can serve unconfirmed in an advice-and-consent position in a federal department. Su's legality expires Oct. 7. Her supporters say a Labor Department succession statute stipulates no time limit on her ability to serve as acting secretary, so she can continue. But this would be an unconstitutional abridgment of the Senate's power to advise and consent.People advocating a 14th Amendment solution to the problem of Trump are spreading the acids of cynicism and suspicion that are corroding trust in institutions. And some states' election officials - watch Colorado - are apt to seize this occasion for grandstanding, trying to keep Trump's name off their ballots. This will thicken his armor of martyrdom.Besides, this nation was founded on a good idea: the pursuit of happiness. In 2024, for many Americans, happiness will come from casting a vote against Trump.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a rally protesting the electoral college certification of Joe Biden as President in Washington, Jan. 6, 2021.

    "content": "Politicians cannot have it both ways on free speech\n\n October 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jacob Sullum | Page: 6 | Section: Commentary \n \n 644\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Social media companies argue that their content moderation decisions are a form of editorial discretion protected by the First Amendment. Conservative critics of those companies reject that argument, even as they complain that the platforms' decisions reflect a progressive agenda.That contradiction is at the heart of two cases that the Supreme Court recently agreed to hear, which involve constitutional challenges to state laws that aim to correct the bias that Republicans perceive. Although supporters of those laws claim they are defending freedom of speech, that argument hinges on a dangerous conflation of state and private action.The 2021 Florida law at issue in Moody v. NetChoice requires social media platforms to host speech by any \"candidate for office,\" even when it violates their content rules. The law also says platforms may not limit the visibility of material \"by or about\" a political candidate and may not \"censor, deplatform, or shadow ban a journalistic enterprise based on the content of its publication or broadcast.\"The law does not cover relatively small, right-leaning platforms such as Gab, Parler, Rumble and Truth Social. It applies only to the largest platforms, such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and YouTube, which Republicans have long accused of discriminating against conservative speech.Florida politicians made it clear that they were trying to address that perceived imbalance. The bill's legislative findings, which complain that Facebook et al. have \"unfairly censored, shadow banned, deplatformed, and applied post-prioritization algorithms,\" assert that the state has a \"substantial interest in protecting its residents from inconsistent and unfair actions\" by those platforms.\"If Big Tech censors enforce rules inconsistently, to discriminate in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley ideology,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis declared upon signing the bill in May 2021, \"they will now be held accountable.\" Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez said Florida was \"tak(ing) back the virtual public square\" from \"big tech oligarchs\" who were determined to \"censor views that run contrary to their radical leftist narrative.\"Four months later, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the law at issue in NetChoice v. Paxton, which says social media platforms may not \"censor\" speech based on \"viewpoint\" and defines censorship to include not just deletion but also any steps that make user-posted content less visible, accessible or lucrative. Like Florida's statute, the Texas law is limited to the largest platforms, which Abbott said were trying to \"silence conservative viewpoints and ideas,\" adding, \"It is now law that conservative viewpoints in Texas cannot be banned on social media.\"In May 2022, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit unanimously ruled that the major provisions of Florida's law probably violated the right to exercise editorial judgment, which the Supreme Court has recognized in diverse cases involving a Miami newspaper, an electric utility's newsletter and a private organization's St. Patrick's Day parade. The 11th Circuit noted that \"private actors have a First Amendment right to be 'unfair' - which is to say, a right to have and express their own points of view.\"A divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit rejected that conclusion when it considered the Texas social media law later that year. Because they rely heavily on algorithms, do not review content before publication and take action against only a tiny percentage of messages, Judge Andrew Oldham said in the majority opinion, Facebook et al. \"are nothing like\" a newspaper.Writing in dissent, Judge Leslie Southwick objected to that characterization. While \"none of the precedents fit seamlessly,\" Southwick said, a social media platform's right to curate content is analogous to \"the right of newspapers to control what they do and do not print.\"In arguing that the 5th Circuit got it right, DeSantis, Abbott and like-minded politicians assert that Facebook et al. are pursuing a leftwing agenda while simultaneously denying that the First Amendment protects their right to do so. The Supreme Court should not let them have it both ways.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The first was a Liberty ship built in the United States during World War II.\"It's an honor to maintain the naming tradition for our John Lewis-class oilers, and Harriet Tubman is more than deserving of this recognition,\" Del Toro said in a statement. \"She was born into unimaginable circumstances, but she dedicated her life to facing great danger and adversity, becoming a 'conductor of freedom', helping others escape slavery.\" He continued: \"In addition, during the Civil War, Tubman was the first African American woman to serve formally in the military. Her legacy deserves our nation's continued recognition, and our fleet benefits from having her name emblazoned on the hull of one of our great ships.\" Born into slavery in Dorchester County in 1822, Tubman was named Araminta by her enslaved parents, Ben and Rit Ross. She changed her name to Harriet after marrying freeman John Tubman in 1844.Tubman escaped slavery in 1849, when her enslaver died, and she was to be sold. Sept. 17, 1849, marks the day Harriet Tubman made the important decision to self-liberate.\"This tribute commemorates the powerful legacy of one of our country's most selfless heroes,\" Sams said. \"The Underground Railroad's most famous conductor was devoted to the cause of ensuring freedom for all despite personal sacrifice and risk. A true role model for the sailors who will serve on the USNS Harriet Tubman, her passion, courage and intelligence empowered her to overcome extreme obstacles for the benefit of others.\" Along with the ship's name, Del Toro announced that the ship's sponsor will be Tina Wyatt, the great-great-great grandniece of Harriet Tubman.The ship's sponsor represents a lifelong relationship with the ship and crew. Wyatt has spent her life helping others as a nurse and educating and sharing the legacy of Harriet Tubman.Wyatt said Tubman is a \"symbol of faith, freedom, family, democracy and love.\" \"Aunt Harriet's legacy is an inspiration to a higher calling within us all, and overall, how we are enabled by sharing love for others and self. It is her supply from God that she had been able to supply others throughout her lifetime and still, her footprint lives on and supplies us now,\" she said. \"Such a strong and dazzling example of symbolism in her honor, the naming of an oiler, a ship that supplies other ships with fuel and cargo to function at its highest level, is an example of what she gave in life and continues to give.\" The future USNS Harriet Tubman is the ninth ship of the John Lewis Class. The class and lead ship are named in honor of the late civil rights icon Rep.John Lewis from Georgia.The ships are designed to supply fuel to the Navy's operating carrier strike groups. The oilers have the ability to carry a load of 162,000 barrels of oil and maintain significant dry cargo capacity. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-California, were evicted Tuesday from their U.S. Capitol hideaway offices in the aftermath of the ousting of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.The ejection of Hoyer and Pelosi from their hideaway offices was one of the first acts of the new interim speaker, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina.Hoyer's communications team confirmed reports that he was ordered out of his hideaway but declined any further comment on the matter in a statement to Capital News Service.A veteran of the House since 1981, Hoyer twice has served as House majority leader: from 2007 until 2011 and 2019 until January of this year.Pelosi, who was speaker until January when the Republican majority took charge, was not able to move her things out of her hideaway herself because she was in California for Sen.Dianne Feinstein's funeral. Feinstein, the longest-serving female senator in U.S. history, died last week at age 90.\"Office space doesn't matter to me, but it seems to be important to them,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"Now that the new Republican Leadership has settled this important matter, let's hope they get to work on what's truly important for the American people.\" \"Sadly, because I am in California to mourn the loss of and pay tribute to my dear friend Dianne Feinstein, I am unable to retrieve my belongings at this time, \" she said.The former speaker said the \"eviction is a sharp departure from tradition,\" and noted that she gave former Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Illinois, \"a significantly larger suite of offices for as long as he wished.\" However, Pelosi deviated from custom as well when she was speaker and revoked Mike Pence's House office space while he was the vice president, instead giving it to the White House legislative affairs team.Both Pelosi and Hoyer occupied large suites of offices in the Capitol when they were in their leadership posts.Capitol hideaways became a tradition and treasured perk as Congress expanded in size and lawmakers desired more space and privacy to conduct their work. All current senior lawmakers have their own assigned hideaways, but the location of these offices are meant to be kept secret, as are who works in each one.These discreet offices - behind unmarked doors - are often used by lawmakers to meet with staff and colleagues, to find a quiet place to rest, or to speak about delicate matters without fear of being overheard.Hideaways have become less secret in recent years as some senators and House members have allowed their staffs to work and hold small meetings in the private spaces. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Those with power are wise to use it while it lasts. Democrats understand this and play accordingly. Republicans, by sharp contrast, volunteer to lose.The GOP's self-destructive nature escalated Tuesday when eight of 221 Republicans joined Democrats to oust Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.The effort, led by Florida Republican Rep. Matt Goetz and assisted by Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck allowed Democrats to take down the highest-ranking Republican in the country - a man third in line for the presidency.The difference between Monday and Tuesday is the difference between having one top-ranking Republican in Washington versus having none. Though Republicans control the House by eight seats, Democrats control the Senate and the White House - and now, it appears, the House again.A member of The Gazette's editorial board spoke Monday with Buck and Goetz as they prepared to dethrone McCarthy. Each spoke of a man they distrust.\"He's just not an honest person,\" Buck said of McCarthy. \"Democrats don't like him because he makes them promises and doesn't keep them. He made promises during the speakers' race, that he would appropriate at a certain level. Then he promised he would appropriate at a higher level. Then he told moderates in the House another number. He has three different numbers out there, they are all promises he made, and now he's stopped trying to reconcile those differences.\"Gaetz spoke about the pressure he has faced to work with McCarthy and other Republicans he considers too eager to compromise away the party's core principles - namely fiscal restraint.\"I've often heard calls for unity that come right before the worse decisions we make,\" Gaetz said, just as he went to work unseating McCarthy.\"There was great unity around the COVID lockdowns. There was total unity on the left and the right when we entered these Middle East wars. We aren't any safer because of either.\"We appreciate Buck's independent streak. He has been among the first to warn fellow Republicans against campaigning on 2020 election conspiracy theories and myths about the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2020.Nor does Gaetz feign party loyalty. \"We are on the eve of the real big distinction,\" Gaetz told The Gazette on Monday. \"It isn't Republican versus Democrat going forward; it is change agents versus the status quo.\"We get the sentiment, and it sounds pretty good. Gaetz, Buck and the other six believe in principle over party. It is hard to deny the nobility of this stand, especially over beers at Old Ebbitt Grill.Just blocks away in Congress, politics doesn't work that way. It is a team sport - for better or worse - pitting one party against another. That's not going to change during the 118th Congress or anytime soon. It is the nature of the beast.Precisely because politics demands teamwork, all 208 Democrats present Tuesday assisted in removing the GOP's only top leader in Washington.For Democrats, Tuesday was cause for celebration. They left their Republican opponents rudderless, embattled and feverishly searching for leadership. The next speaker will quickly face reality, including the need to work with the party that controls the White House and Senate.Buck, Gaetz and the other six mad (this mess knowing their side lacks time to waste.\"We have a serious border crisis, inflation, crime - issues we should be focused on to win elections,\" Buck told The Gazette on Monday.Exactly.Under McCarthy, Republicans made too little progress addressing our most pressing problems. He was far from ideal. Yet, House Republicans today have no time to move an agenda. They're too busy finding their next embattled leader.REPRINTED FROM THE COLORADO SPRINGS GAZETTEDISTRIBUTED BY CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Changing rules nearly ensures primary victory\n\n October 6, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Susan Estrich | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 657\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Beginning last fall, Donald Trump's campaign has been embarked on an effort to change the rules of the delegate selection process to make it easier - and faster - for the front-runner to lock up the nomination. Never has this been more critical, as the former president faces 91 counts in four different states and the prospect that trial proceedings could interrupt his march to the nomination.He was in California last week, not only to woo voters but also to thank the party for changing the rules so that if he wins a majority in the primary, he also wins all of the state's delegates to the convention.Back in 2016, Trump's people got outflanked in key states by Ted Cruz, who managed to secure more delegates even in states where Trump beat him because of the way the rules were structured. That won't happen this time around, according to Ben Ginsberg, one of the nation's top election lawyers, because \"despite a large number of candidates, only the Trump campaign went out and did the really hard grunt work of talking to state parties to try and get them to meld their rules to Donald Trump's favor,\" and has succeeded \"in part because they knew what they were doing and in part because everyone else is asleep at the switch.\"The Supreme Court has ruled that it is the political parties, and not state legislatures, that control the rules for nominating presidential candidates. The Trumpers have been working the system since 2019, managing to convince state parties to either move to winnertake-all systems (which reward frontrunners) or to party caucuses rather than primaries, which are controlled by insiders who Trump has actively courted since then.The convention rules provide that delegates, with few exceptions, are \"bound\" by the results of the primaries and caucuses for at least one round of balloting, unless the candidate they pledged to support drops out of the race. The only exceptions are Pennsylvania's 51 district-level delegates, North Dakota's 29 delegates, Wyoming's three party leader delegates, the 18 delegates from American Samoa and Guam, and the three party leader delegates from the Virgin Islands, who by their local party rules are \"unpledged.\"All told, according to Ballotpedia, there will be an estimated 2,467 delegates at next summer's Republican convention: 2,363 pledged delegates and 104 unpledged delegates. To win the nomination, the candidate must receive the votes of a majority, some 1,234 delegates. Trump is aiming to get to that number before any prosecutors get to him.Does that mean that delegates cannot vote their conscience? What happens when intervening events change the dynamic of the race?In 2016, in what was seen as an effort to stop Trump, then Rules Committee member Curly Haugland argued that under the rules, delegates should be free to vote their consciences and not to be bound by the votes in state primaries and caucuses. He and a colleague, Sean Parnell, a public policy consultant in Virginia, published a book entitled \"Unbound: The Conscience of a Republican Delegate,\" and made the round of talk shows, arguing that Trump could still be stopped.In 1980, Democrat Ted Kennedy made the same argument in an effort to stop the nomination of Jimmy Carter. The nomination was effectively decided on the first night of the convention, when delegates rejected the effort to change Rule 11(h) - what we on the Kennedy side called the \"robot rule\" - which bound delegates, two-thirds of whom were pledged to Carter.The convention is, after all, the highest authority of both parties; it makes the rules and can change the rules. I cut my teeth on that campaign, writing speeches about why a robot rule should not control the convention. What if the prospective nominee committed a crime between the primary and the convention, we asked. What if he were convicted of one? In 1980, it was a rhetorical question. In 2024, come this summer in Milwaukee, it may not be rhetorical at all.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Republican Party has transformed into cult\n\n October 6, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Alan Kanner | Page: 7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The morbid decline of the Republican Party is real. When Dick Cheney, one of the key architects of the colossal moral failure of going to war in Iraq, states that he no longer recognizes the Republican Party, it's clear that the U.S. is in serious trouble.One of the main reasons the Republican Party is unrecognizable is because a large segment has transformed into an actual cult. While there is a wide assortment of cults, they do share some common characteristics: a blind devotion to the leader, profound irrational thinking, absolute intolerance of criticism of the leader and ideology, chaotic organization and reorganization and eventual decline into violence. Jan. 6, 2021, is an excellent example of cult-driven behaviors.The Republican Party was not always a cult. For example, 40 years ago, when President Reagan - a man today still esteemed and venerated by many within the Republicans party - vetoed the Anti-Apartheid Act in 1986, more than 25 Republican senators and more than 50 Republican representatives joined the Democrats to overturn Reagan's veto.In a similar manner, about 15 Republican senators and 30 Republican representatives joined the Democrats to overturn Reagan's veto of the 1988 Civil Rights Restoration Act. Can you possibly imagine today's Republicans voting against a Trump initiative? The few that have attempted to obstruct Trump have had to leave the party.Recall the decades long efforts by the Republican Party to defend the tobacco industry and obstruct virtually any regulation. It wasn't until Judge Gladys Kessler declared in 2006 that for decades the tobacco industry lied to, misrepresented and deceived the American public, that the hypocrisy was dramatically exposed.That big business interests reign supreme within the Republican Party is evident in its preposterous advocacy of the Citizens United decision that corporations, like individual real people, have the same rights to political contributions. If corporation are the same as individuals, why haven't I ever seen a corporation sitting next to me in a doctor's office, buying groceries, riding a bus or a train or having a conversation?For decades we have known about the impending climate crisis. And the Republican response? As with the tobacco industry, they deny! deny! deny! According to them, real science is irrelevant and there is no climate crisis. Thus far in 2023, not one Republican presidential candidate has even uttered the word \"climate\" in their campaign rhetoric and basically shrug when it got mentioned briefly in one of the \"debates.\"Can we realistically expect that the Republican Party will turn this country in the right direction and address our profound crisis after their traitorous dereliction of duty as seen on Jan. 6 when eight Republican senators and 139 Republican representatives voted not to fulfill their Constitutional duty and certify a legal and fair election?In 2000, Al Gore lost the election by 534 votes in merely one state and decided that it could harm the country to engage in a prolonged legal dispute after a states' rights-oriented Supreme Court overruled the decision of the Supreme Court of the state of Florida and actually stipulated in their decision that their judgment applied to this case and this case alone - thereby publicly certifying the extent of the abnormality of their decision.Where would the climate crisis be today if Al Gore were president in 2000? In addition, it seems likely to me that a Gore presidency would have preserved the lives of 4,492 American service members in the Iraq war that died, the more than 32,000 U.S service members injured, the countless numbers of PTSD victims, as well as a quarter of a million Iraqis (the Iraqi number can only be estimated).It has taken less than 20 years for the Republican Party to be largely transmogrified from a corporate-friendly party of the rich into a cult veering sharply toward autocracy.But there is no shortage of \"Judge Kesslers\" now exposing Trump for the fraud, liar and election denier that he is, so we the people will ultimately be our own Judge Kessler in the court of public opinion. We will either pass sentence in favor of decency and democracy or we will continue to suffer the wounds inflicted by Republican devotion to shameless \"leaders.\"Alan Kanner is a psychologist in Amherst, Massachusetts. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dems score coup with McCarthy ouster\n\n October 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: David Harsanyi | Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 640\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Kevin McCarthy has become the first House speaker to ever be successfully ousted in a motion to vacate vote. One day, you can tell your grandchildren you were alive to witness this completely pointless bit of history.Rep. Matt Gaetz's (R-Fla.) self-aggrandizing political stunt makes no sense and changes nothing - other than perhaps his fundraising totals.And other than some platitudinous blathering about \"the establishment\" and \"the uniparty,\" I still haven't seen anyone offer a coherent reason - not even retroactively - for how any of this is the \"best way to advance the conservative agenda.\" It would be one thing, perhaps an admirable thing, if Gaetz had gone on this crusade for a coherent ideological or principled reason. But his post-ousting demagoguery and grandstanding about issues completely unrelated to McCarthy's job performance proved it was a personal matter.\"I don't think voting against Kevin McCarthy is chaos,\" Gaetz explained.\"I think $33 trillion in debt is chaos. I think that facing a $2.2 trillion annual deficit is chaos.\" Now, there are numerous people to blame for the impending fiscal disaster, but McCarthy is no more guilty than most.One of the least convincing claims by Gaetz's defenders is that McCarthy was punished for ignoring the base. \"The base,\" of course, is a popular euphemism for the most vociferous populist faction of the GOP.This faction enjoys blowing things up - mostly their own party's prospects. In this case, the \"base\" was represented by eight Republicans and the entire Democratic Party.And among these principled eight GOPers who were fighting for the honor of the base - what The New York Times called the \"far-right GOP faction\" - were Reps.Nancy Mace (who said Gaetz was a \"fraud\" the last time he tried to knock off McCarthy) and Ken Buck (who we last heard was reportedly looking for a CNN gig). I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the future of conservatism was not the motivating factor for their votes.Most Trump-endorsed candidates didn't even participate in McCarthy's removal. Donald Trump himself tepidly supported the speaker because, as he noted, the man had said \"very great things\" about him. And, really, what's more important? Though, I bet McCarthy was expecting a far more energetic defense after pathetically ingratiating himself to the former president a couple of weeks ago.Even if Gaetz had excellent reasons, Republicans did not eject McCarthy.Eight Republicans can't do anything by themselves. No, 208 Democrats ousted McCarthy with the help of some petulant backbenchers nursing personal vendettas. It is a political coup for the Dems.Gaetz, who only yesterday was going on about McCarthy's \"secret deal\" with Democrats, had no qualms sitting on the opposition side of the House plotting to oust a speaker who holds a rickety nine-seat majority. If there was actually a brewing House rebellion, Gaetz would have been able to corral far more votes.But Gaetz wanted to \"break the fever\" of D.C., so he teamed up with minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, \"the squad,\" Adam Schiff and so on. Jeffries claimed he was supporting Gaetz's efforts because Republicans have shown an \"unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner.\" The notion that Democrats are backing a leading MAGA loyalist because they want to temper the \"extremism\" of Republicans makes about as much sense as Jamaal Bowman's fire alarm story. Democrats keep pretending they yearn for a more responsible GOP and stable political environment, then keep supporting every fringe effort and candidate to undermine both.Of course, no one is owed anything.McCarthy isn't the only person available in D.C. to serve as a middling speaker of the House. And, frankly, if he'd been more talented at the job, he might have headed off this challenge more effectively. But it's doubtful anyone is going to perform better with a slender majority and the Senate and presidency in Democrats' hands.But then again, none of that matters when you're having a tantrum. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2023-10-11",
    "author": "Byron York",
    "content": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will appeal to some voters\n\n October 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Byron York | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 1303\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For all the talk that has sometimes surrounded his presidential candidacy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was never able to break through in the Democratic primary race against President Joe Biden.Reports would say his support was \"growing,\" or that he was \"surging,\" but he was never able to surpass the 20% support in national polls he enjoyed when he announced his candidacy as a Democrat in late April.In the months since, his support among Democratic voters has slowly slipped. It now stands just below 15% in the Real-ClearPolitics average of national polls - 47 points behind Biden.Biden organized a strong effort among Democrats to strangle the Kennedy challenge in the crib.It worked. Kennedy faced relentless criticism from well-connected Democrats and hit-job articles in the Democratic-adjacent media. The motivating force was a fear that Kennedy would take support away from Biden and allow former President Donald Trump to reclaim the presidency.All that meant RFK Jr.'s candidacy as a Democrat wasn't going anywhere. No matter how much he campaigned, his situation was not going to improve in the face of broad opposition among Democratic officialdom.This week, Kennedy changed course. In a speech Monday in Philadelphia, he announced that he was leaving the Democratic race and is now running for president as an independent.Instead of struggling under the hostile domination of the Democratic Party, he will now run freely, although he will likely end up struggling to get on some state ballots as an independent.As he runs, Kennedy will find himself targeted by both the Democratic and Republican parties.He has already faced new attacks from the Democratic side, and on Monday, to go along with Kennedy's announcement, the Republican National Committee released what it called \"23 Reasons to Oppose RFK Jr.\" Reason Number 3 was, \"He has admitted his candidacy will 'take more votes' from the Republican candidate than Biden.\" But will Kennedy really take more votes from the Republican candidate, specifically Trump, than from Biden? Or will he take more votes away from Biden than the Republican candidate? Each party will answer in its own interest.A recent Ipsos survey found Biden and Trump tied in a two-way race at 35% each. But in a threeway race with Kennedy, Trump had a slight lead over Biden, 33% to 31%, with Kennedy at 14%. In that scenario, Kennedy took a little more from Biden than from Trump, but that little bit might be enough to determine the election.There is another way to gauge what effect Kennedy might have on the general election, and that is to listen to what he says. Kennedy's 48-minute speech Monday was a brilliant effort to cut a path between the two parties, but there is no doubt it leaned more toward the Democratic side of the political argument.Kennedy analyzed what he called the urge to take sides in politics. When there are just two equally matched sides, he said, disastrous results can follow.\"In a two-sided conflict, both parties have a kind of mutual dependency,\" he said. \"Each side depends on the other to define themselves as good guys, in contrast to the other side who, of course, are the bad guys. Well, if you're Team Good, you will do anything, no matter how unscrupulous, to defeat Team Evil. And that's why we've seen both parties sacrificing their core values and the foundational canons of democracy in an all-out struggle for power.\" Now, Kennedy said, the battle of Team Good and Team Evil has led to a terrible choice.\"Three-quarters of Americans believe that President Biden is too old to govern effectively. President Trump faces multiple civil and criminal trials.Both of them have favorability ratings that are deep in negative territory.That's what twoparty politics has given us.\" That will probably appeal to the independent streak in millions of American voters. Kennedy encouraged that when he said, \"The Democrats are frightened that I'm going to spoil the election for President Biden, and the Republicans are frightened that I'm going to spoil the election for President Trump.\" He then added: \"The truth is, they're both right.\" A certain type of voter will like that.Kennedy said a few things to appeal to Republicans, most notably when he said he had been wrong about people who wanted to control the flow of illegal crossers at the U.S. Mexico border.\"Six months ago, I thought that an open border was a humanitarian policy,\" he said. \"If you were for sealing the border, it meant that you were probably a xenophobe, and maybe a racist.\" But now, having visited the border and seen the problem for himself, he sees that those who seek greater controls on the border have a good point. \"I was wrong,\" he confessed.Yes, those statements will attract independents and some Republicans.But overall, the tone and content of Kennedy's pitch was unmistakably Democratic. He began with a meditation on the plight of Native Americans, recounting his father's visit to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in 1968. He spoke gratefully of the renaming of Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples' Day.\"It shows that our country is now ready to explore and to tell each other the untold histories of those dispossessed people who have previously languished on the margins,\" Kennedy said. Whatever you might think of such sentiments, it is not the stuff of Republican campaign rallies.Kennedy went on, though, to link Indigenous Peoples' Day with the malaise affecting millions of Americans.\"Today, as the corrupt powers have overtaken our government, the ranks of the dispossessed have swelled so that they not only include Indigenous Americans and Black Americans and Hispanic Americans, they include tens of millions of people who live paycheck to paycheck in financial desperation,\" Kennedy said.\"The dispossessed also include the legions of the chronically ill, the addicted, the depressed, the 80% of our country that cannot afford a middle class lifestyle.\" A lot has been made of Kennedy's attraction to conspiracy theories.It comes through all the time in his speaking.He talked about the deep divisions in today's politics not as an organic development but as the result of bad actors behind the scenes.\"People suspect that the divisions are deliberately orchestrated, and that getting us to hate each other is all part of the scam,\" he said. At times it sounded quite Trumpian.What to make of Kennedy's message? First, it is really striking. It is impressive. No candidate is speaking that way on the campaign trail today.The last one who even approximated Kennedy's message was Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016 and 2020, but Kennedy's occasional breaks with orthodoxy, like the border, are more sweeping and interesting than Sanders' were.Kennedy's appeal will also touch some of the instincts that caused millions of Americans to vote for Trump in 2016.Indeed, he seems to have a highly developed sense of the feelings of alienation and disgust with the failures of both parties that motivated a significant part of Trump's support the first time around.Now, though, it seems highly unlikely that any voter who wants to support Trump again in 2024 would switch to Kennedy.On the other hand, a certain style of voter, leaning toward Democrats but dismayed by Biden's age and infirmity, and also inclined to look fondly on the old style of Democratic Party liberalism associated with memories of Bobby Kennedy, might give RFK Jr. a serious look. How many of them are there in the 2024 electorate?Maybe not many.But if the race is between Biden and Trump, an independent candidate could change the race by attracting even a relatively small number of voters. Kennedy has the ability to do just that.Byron York is chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner.COPYRIGHT 2023 BYRON YORK DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYN DICA TION \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nDemocratic presidential candidate Robert F.

    "content": "Cardin threatens to end military sales to Egypt\n\n October 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Fatema Hosseini; Capital News Service | Page: 14 | Section: News \n \n 677\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, the newly appointed chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has announced plans to block future U.S. military aid and arms sales to Egypt unless that country shows \"concrete, meaningful, and sustainable steps\" to improve its human rights record.\"It is imperative that we continue to hold the government of Egypt, and all governments, accountable for their human rights violations,\" Cardin said in a statement.Cardin's decision marks a significant shift in U.S. policy towards Egypt, a long-standing ally in the Middle East.The senator plans to block $235 million in foreign military assistance that the Biden administration approved on Sept.14.The move starkly contrasts with the actions of Cardin's predecessor, Sen.Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, who was indicted Sept. 22 for allegedly accepting bribes to influence U.S. policy in favor of the Egyptian government.Cardin's action is colliding with the Biden administration's efforts to foster closer ties with Egypt.State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said in a press briefing Wednesday that the United States aims to advance a strategic partnership with Egypt that ensures regional security and fosters significant progress on human rights issues.Patel added that Secretary of State Antony Blinken believes waiving certain conditions for Egypt's foreign military financing in fiscal 2022 aligned with U.S. national security interests.A total of $1.215 billion in military aid has been allocated for Egypt and discussions with Congress and Egyptian partners are ongoing, Patel said.\"I was very open in my disappointment in the administration using the waiver on the use of funds, but I want to have a chance to meet with the administration,\" Cardin told Politico.Before assuming his current role, Cardin had criticized the Biden administration for overriding a human rights prohibition on $320 million of military aid to Egypt.He was among a group of senators, including independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Tom Carper of Delaware that urged the Biden administration to withhold the $320 million from Egypt.The senators argued that the Egyptian government had failed to make \"meaningful progress in addressing human rights concerns\" and that withholding the funds was \"required by law\" in the fiscal 2022 spending bill.In a July 28 letter to Blinken, the senators charged that the Egyptian government had \"not only failed to investigate allegations of human rights abuses, it has also continued to commit 'significant human rights' violations such as extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearance, torture and life-threatening prison conditions, and severe restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and association, as documented in the State Department's latest human rights report.\" According to Amnesty International, Egyptian authorities severely restrict civil liberties, including freedom of expression and assembly.In the lead-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in November 2022, 895 political prisoners were released but nearly triple that number were arrested, according to Amnesty International.\"Sexual and gender-based violence remained prevalent, amid the authorities' failure to adequately prevent and punish it,\" Amnesty International said. Workers' rights and religious freedoms are also suppressed, and refugees are mistreated.The decision to freeze aid could have geopolitical implications.As a result of the aid hold, \"the anti-America(n) camp will be empowered domestically,\" Haisam Hassanein, an adjunct fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Jewish Insider.He predicted that the group would publicly push for Egypt to strengthen its relations with Russia and China.\"This could force President (Abdel Fattah El-) Sisi in his current election campaign to release some (inflammatory) statements to save face in front of his constituents,\" Hassanein said.On Wednesday, Cardin also announced plans to halt security assistance to Azerbaijan due to its \"brutal campaign\" in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, effectively erasing its Armenian population.Cardin emphasized the need to document war crimes and atrocities and to support efforts to repatriate prisoners of war.He called for increased humanitarian support for ethnic Armenians who have left Nagorno-Karabakh and for the United States to continue supporting democratic reforms in Armenia. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Antisemites fail to condemn terrorism of Hamas butchers\n\n October 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Susan Estrich | Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 761\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It should not be difficult to condemn terrorism.It has nothing to do with whether you support the current Israeli government and its policies.One can sympathize with the plight of the Palestinians, as many of us do.But that has nothing to do with the brutal murders of women and children and the elderly, with the point-blank executions of 260 young people attending a music festival, with the slaughter of children in front of their parents or of parents in front of their children, as Hamas did.For a very long time, those on the left who have been most critical of Israel's policies have insisted that they are anti-Israel and not antisemites. Not so.Those who do not condemn Hamas are antisemites. It is as simple as that.The mass murder of over 1,000 Jews - the worst day in Jewish history since the Holocaust - was driven by hatred of all Jews.To blame Israel for this mass murder is an expression of antisemitism at its worst.In New York's Times Square last Sunday, the antisemites held a rally in support of Palestine. They were joined by their allies - Nazis waving swastikas.What is wrong with these peopleftThey are haters, and they cheer the butchers.Consider the statements by the congresswomen who are part of the \"Squad,\" members of the Democratic Socialists of America, justifying the brutality of animals.Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, was quick to blame Israel.\"The path to that future must include lifting the blockade, ending the occupation and dismantling the apartheid system that creates the suffocating, dehumanizing conditions that can lead to resistance,\" she stated.Resistance? Killing grandmothers, raping women, beheading babies. That is not resistance. That is pure evil.Rep. Cori Bush wrote on X: \"A military response will only exacerbate the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis alike. As part of achieving a just and lasting peace, we must do our part to stop this violence and trauma by ending US government support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.\" To call for ending U.S. government support for Israel, at this point, to condemn a military response, is the position of only those who hate Jews and are willing to excuse animal savagery.Rep. Ilhan Omar went so far as to call the cutoff of supplies to Gaza a \"war crime\" and tweeted that \"the solution to this horror, as ever, is a negotiated peace\" and expressed her opposition to \"continuing unconditional weapons sales and military aid to Israel.\" A negotiated peace with terrorists and butchers? Opposition to military aid to Israel as it seeks to defend itself from murderers?What is stunning about these statements is what is missing from them.Where is the recognition that Hamas is a terrorist organization backed by Iran?Where is the condemnation of those who would murder a grandmother and post the video on her Facebook page?Where is the outrage at the mass murders of young people dancing the night away to celebrate peace, the slaughter of civilians, the kidnapping and rape of innocents?Some 30 student organizations at Harvard signed a joint letter holding \"the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.\" Harvard's leadership, which was quick to issue statements condemning police brutality after the killing of George Floyd, took two days to respond, initially with only a tepid letter saying the students did not speak for the university.Jewish students are rightly outraged at the recognition that antisemitism is flourishing on campuses across the country.\"Black Lives Matter Grassroots\" put out a statement saying that \"we must stand unwaveringly on the side of the oppressed.\" Because Palestinians \"have been subject to decades of apartheid and unimaginable violence, their resistance must not be condemned, but understood as a desperate act of self-defense.\" Since when does mass murder of innocent civilians, decapitating babies, qualify as \"resistance,\" much less self-defense?The people of Israel, many millions of whom do not support the domestic policies of the Netanyahu administration, are united now because they are confronting an enemy who would wipe the Jewish state and the Jewish people off the face of the globe. Hamas is also our enemy, and to treat them as anything other than that is antisemitism, pure and simple.Those of us who have condemned antisemitism on the far right, as well we should, must be just as vigilant in condemning those on the left who are equally hateful. The savagery of Hamas is so easy to condemn that those who fail to do so deserve to be \"outed\" as the antisemites that they have always been.Savagery reveals their true colors.COPYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Voices need to champion love over territory in the Middle East\n\n October 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Armstong Williams | Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 965\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, ruthlessly killing over 1,000 Israelis in the name of their god and in furtherance of their desire for Israel's land. These savages - as they may aptly be called - in concert with Iran and their disjointed Palestinian allies have a single-minded goal: to obliterate Israel and its people.The good news for Israel is that this might be the extent of the attackers' capabilities. However, despite Israel's overwhelming might and strength, they were caught off guard. The pressing question on everyone's mind is how this could happen given Israel's extensive spy network and technology that taps into conversations from every corner of the Middle East.How did they miss this?The ongoing regional conflict, tracing its roots at least as far back as the early 1900s, witnessed another episode when Hamas launched an attack on Israel. We must acknowledge that this isn't necessarily a failure of U.S. or Israeli intelligence. The nature of the attacks experienced by Israel suggests the work of a group more akin to a militia rather than a truly centralized, coordinated effort.Militias present a unique challenge.Their lack of centralized coordination ironically often renders their actions more unpredictable and thus harder to anticipate. This dynamic can be seen in places like Afghanistan, which has been colloquially termed as \"the graveyard of empires.\" The region's heavy reliance on militias to confront adversaries creates a treacherous environment for invading forces.The unpredictable nature of militias, with their varying degrees of sophistication, numerous units, and dispersed operations, leaves armies essentially navigating in the dark, relying solely on the immediate intelligence gathered by their frontline troops.The attacks on 9/11 serve as a reminder that even the mightiest superpowers can be caught off guard by small militia groups, no matter the intensity of their defense mechanisms. The events of that day were orchestrated by mere men armed with knives, and the fallout was arguably the most significant tragedy in American history.The U.S., in many ways like Israel, has thwarted countless plots - many more than the general public would likely want to be aware of. However, it only takes one overlooked detail, one lapse in intelligence, to lead to immense repercussions.In the current scenario, we see individuals soaring into Israel on motorized gliders, brandishing AK-47s. This is not a conventional army; it's not a group that can be sat down for negotiations. It's a stark contrast to the times of Henry Kissinger, where diplomatic shuttling could lead to treaties and conflict resolutions.In this situation, there's no room for such traditional diplomacy. The most viable course of action appears to be defense and retaliation, with the hope that lessons are learned. This way, if caught off guard again, the response can be more swift and effective.The behavior exhibited by certain pro-Palestinian activists celebrating this brutality is nothing short of appalling. These aren't advocates for peace or any noble cause; they seem to have lost all touch with humanity.Their behavior is akin to savages, taking pleasure in violence and parading their heinous actions as if collecting trophies.When groups like the New York City Democratic Socialists of America rally in support of these actions in places such as Times Square and outside the Israeli consulate, like they recently did, it's a chilling reminder of the depths of depravity some are willing to sink to. The terrifying reality is that there are backers for this kind of barbarity right on our doorstep.There's a thought-provoking sentiment I recently encountered that offers a unique perspective on this conflict situation. It asks: \"If both sides had the power to do whatever they wanted, what would they do?\" Undeniably, Israel has a formidable military. They have the means, if they so choose, to exert overwhelming force. In a day, Palestine could be wiped from the face of the Earth. Yet, they show restraint. This restraint is not merely out of fear of international condemnation but rooted in their national and humanistic values.These savages are different. If the roles were reversed, they would undoubtedly kill every Jew and Israeli; seeing dead Israeli bodies paraded around Palestine proves this point.Advocates of this indiscriminate slaughter do so on the grounds that they consider it to be morally justifiable.The moral rationale behind engaging in ransacking followed by rape, murder and subsequently parading their bodies is beyond my comprehension. Nevertheless, even assuming it was somehow justifiable, we must remember that this is wholly based on a lie.These fringe organizations frequently express their support despite the fact that the media, which is remarkably more pro-Israeli today, disseminates false information about this regional conflict regularly. The notion that Israel intentionally targets Palestinian children and adults for slaughter is an absurdity that defies the facts.Each time armaments and missiles are directed toward Israel, Israel retaliates by immobilizing these weapons.But, alas, these terrorists house these weapons in schools and residential buildings. Does Israel bear responsibility for Hamas deliberately storing those weapons in schools with the intention of using the bodies of children as a defense mechanism? Must Israel simply allow their own children to continually be bombarded by rockets?These behaviors are consistent with criminal savages, not saints, and they are certainly not deserving of adoration.However, they are given it, and in this world, we will perpetually contend with savages and those who support them. Savages are doomed to exist. They are unreceptive to rationality.I firmly believe that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians, like people everywhere, are goodhearted individuals seeking peaceful lives free from the constant shadow of conflict. The world needs more voices championing love over territory, unity over division.We should be promoting understanding and coexistence, instead of allowing narrow political agendas to dictate our future. We must rise above the strife, come together, and shape a future filled with hope and prosperity for all.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREAT ORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tim Scott should act boldly and drop out of race\n\n October 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George F. Will | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 781\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - There is national incredulity, exhaustion, embarrassment, disgust and fatalism about the political parties' inability to generate palatable presidential choices.Tim Scott could alter this with a trifecta of statesmanlike acts: withdrawing from the competition for the Republican presidential nomination, challenging others to do likewise and exhorting them to join him in supporting Nikki Haley.This is the South Carolina senator's choice: He can acknowledge that his energetic campaigning has failed to enkindle sufficient enthusiasm and depart as he campaigned, cheerfully. Or he can try to become someone whom, to his credit, he has no aptitude for being - another peddler of synthetic anger, stoking today's rage culture.Of Scott we may say what Sam Rayburn, Democratic House speaker for 17 years, reportedly said of Dwight D. Eisenhower when in 1948 Democrats contemplated giving Ike their presidential nomination: \"Good man but wrong business.\" Actually, Ike was, like Scott, a good man and, as Scott someday could be, a fine president. Scott is not, however, the man for this season.By catalyzing a coalescence around Haley, Scott could transform the nation's political mood.As long as the Republican race pits Donald Trump against a cluster of lagging pursuers, the nominating electorate cannot ponder a binary choice.When, however, it is Trump against one experienced, polished, steely and unintimidated adversary, voters can internalize this exhilarating reality: There is a choice suitable for a great nation.Scott could mercifully end the candidates' miserable \"debates,\" which are caricatures of real ones and diminish everyone involved. (In the Lincoln-Douglas debates, one spoke for an hour, the other for 90 minutes, then the first speaker delivered a 30-minute answer.)More 60-second simplicities about complexities will benefit only the nonparticipating candidate, who has time on his side.Trump is so deeply shallow that many might still underestimate his potential destructiveness, of which fresh evidence constantly accumulates. Most recently: his reported telling a foreign blatherskite secret details concerning U.S. nuclear submarines, the foundation of deterrence.A reelected Trump, having promised to secure Russia's success against Ukraine - he vows to end the war \"in 24 hours\" - would mean the unraveling of collective security, from Europe to the Far East: Serious nations will not tether themselves to a United States that tethers itself to someone who is in equal measures frivolous, petulant and malevolent.If after Super Tuesday (March 5), a Trump nomination seems highly probable, a serious third-party candidacy will become probable, as will multiplying uncertainties. If, however, Haley deflates the Trump blimp, the Democratic Party also could benefit.She would be heavily favored against the fast-fading President Biden. So, if her nomination becomes likely, Democratic panic might produce what Democratic prudence evidently will not: a 2024 ticket other than one joining someone no longer fit for the presidency with someone who never will be fit.Haley has established policy preeminence among her Republican rivals.Regarding foreign policy, she has been the most forthright against the amalgam of nihilism, isolationism and opportunism currently fueling many elected Republicans' eagerness to appease Russia. In domestic policy, she alone is ready to address, with changes affecting only people far from retirement, the unsustainable trajectory of Social Security and Medicare, and this ticking fiscal time bomb: Soon, the federal government will spend $1 trillion annually on debt service alone.Haley's policy preeminence among the Republican aspirants must become political preeminence, quickly. What Gen. Douglas MacArthur said of military disasters is also true of political ones: They are explained by two words - \"too late.\" Too late to respond proactively.With every passing day, the probability of a national disgrace - a Trump nomination - increases. And with it the probability of another disgrace, a Biden-Trump rematch, which might mean the probability of another Trump presidency.The Republican contenders are unintentionally enacting a political version of the tragedy of the commons: When everyone has a right to graze cattle on the commons, no one has an incentive for restraint; soon, the commons are barren and all who pursued their self-interest are equally injured.If four or more of Trump's Republican rivals slog on, each hoping a strong Iowa showing will propel them to stronger ones in New Hampshire and South Carolina, they are all likely to finish with equally barren prospects.Their replication of the tragedy of the commons will, unless disrupted now, produce a national tragedy.Tim Scott, by acting boldly - one might say presidentially - against a dismally predictable political dynamic, could give a grateful nation hope for the redemption of this shabby era.Disclosure: The columnist's wife, Mari Will, an adviser to Republican presidential candidate Sen.

I look forward to swiftly introducing a bipartisan resolution when the Senate reconvenes to demonstrate our ironclad support for Israel's security.\" Risch, the ranking Republican on the foreign relations panel, said in a statement that \"the devastating attacks against Israel are a reminder of why the United States unequivocally supports the people of Israel.\" \"We mourn the loss of Israelis, Americans, and others who have been killed in these senseless acts of terrorism,\" he said. \"Support to Israel is already on the way, and Congress will work to speed up additional assistance as quickly as possible.\" The senators' measure is expected to pass the Senate by unanimous consent.In an unprecedented surprise attack Saturday, Hamas fired a barrage of rockets and militants stormed Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip, killing about 1,300 people, wounding more than 3,000 and abducting between 100 and 150 people. Israel responded with over 2,000 airstrikes and called up 360,000 reservists, the largest compulsory mobilization since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.Israel's retaliatory bombardment has deepened the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, where over two million Palestinians live densely packed and under a land, sea and air blockade enforced by Israel since 2007.Following Saturday's attack, Israel cut off Gaza's electricity and the sole power plant is running out of fuel, which will restrict access to water, sanitation facilities and health care facilities.No evidence of Iran's involvement in the attack has emerged, but Iran has provided long-standing support for Hamas, including weapons and financing that may have contributed to the complex operation.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, said they will ask for unanimous consent in the Senate to approve legislation that would freeze $6 billion in Iranian humanitarian funds being held in Qatar that the Biden administration agreed to release in exchange for the freedom of five American prisoners held by Iran.The need for that legislation may be moot: the United States and Qatar have agreed to block Iran from getting to the $6 billion account, the Washington Post and NBC reported Thursday.National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications Adm. John Kirby refused to confirm those reports at a White House briefing Thursday. But he emphasized that the funds in Qatar remain untouched.\"None of it has been accessed by Iran at all,\" Kirby said.The House, meanwhile, remains leaderless and cannot attempt to pass legislation, such as additional emergency military aid to Israel, until members elect a new speaker. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "War in the Holy Land - More Dems pressure Biden to publicly freeze $6B in Iranian assets; potential wider conflict confront Israel, Gaza\n\n October 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 2 | Section: News \n \n 1493\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n More U.S. senators, including Democrats, are joining the push to get the Biden administration to refreeze $6 billion in Iranian assets released as part of a September prisoner swamp after Hamas' attacks, including killing civilians, inside Israel.The effort comes as urban warfare in Gaza and worries of a wider conflict in the Middle East confront Israel as it strikes back at Hamas in the Palestinian territory.On the Iranian asset front, the Biden administration continues to be pushed to refreeze the $6 billion in Iranian assets after the Hamas killings, which included women and children. Tehran is a prime backer of Hamas, Hezbollah and other anti-Israel militants.Last week, Democratic U.S. Sens. Jon Tester on Montana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia joined the chorus of Republicans pressing Biden to refreeze the Iranian money after the bloodshed.U.S. Sens. Steve Daines of Montana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Marco Rubio of Florida are part of that GOP push.On Friday, Tester and Manchin were joined by 12 other senators (5 Republicans, 6 Democrats and one independent) in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in asking the White House to publicly freeze the Iranian money.\"We write to you in light of Hamas' violent and horrific terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7 which killed over a thousand innocent civilians, including American citizens. Given Iran's history of supporting acts of terrorism through Hamas, the United States must do everything in its power in the wake of this brutal attack to ensure that Iran is not in a position to continue funding Hamas' terrorist activities in Israel and throughout the Middle East,\" the senators wrote.\"While we understand that there are reports of an agreement with Qatar to freeze $6 billion in Iranian assets, we urge you to make this decision official U.S. policy and continue your efforts to limit Iran's ability to provide support to Hamas.\" Senators that are part of the push include Republicans Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Todd Young of Indiana and Joni Ernst of Iowa, Democrats Sherrod Brown of Ohio as well as Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto (both of Nevada) and Independent Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.A quiet deal?The Biden administration has stopped short of confirming reports that the U.S. and Qatar have reached a quiet deal to sequester the Iranian money. Blinken and White House national security spokesman John Kirby have resisted confirming the Qatar reports or publicly committing to refreezing the assets.Instead, they have stressed that Iran has not touched any of the $6 billion and that money is overseen by the U.S. and is supposed to only be used for humanitarian aid inside Iran.U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, said the quiet deal relate to the Iranian money could be temporary and he wants Congress to move to make the refreezing permanent.Daines backs that effort.\"We have witnessed horrific attacks on the Israeli people by the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hamas. The United States needs to lead by example and sanction this dangerous regime,\" Daines said.Kirby stressed Friday other U.S. sanctions related to Iran and its help for militant and terrorist groups.Israel at war The White House national security spokesman also said there were no plans to put U.S combat troops in Israel as the Israel Defense Forces prepare for an expected invasion of Gaza where Hamas is based and more than 2.1 million people live in area roughly the same size as Philadelphia and Detroit.There have been more than 1,200 Israelis killed in the Hamas terror attacks.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted pictures on Twitter/X showing \"babies murdered and burned\" in the Saturday, Oct. 7 carnage.The Palestinian Health Authority reports more than 1,500 deaths in Gaza with continued IDF shelling and missile strikes since the Hamas attacks.Israel has also told residents of Gaza to evacuate to certain years with a ground invasion expected. The IDF made some incursions into Gaza Friday.The U.S. has moved an aircraft carrier group into the Mediterranean Sea as well as more fighter jets into the region as deterrence for Iran and other anti-Israeli actors involving themselves in the Hamas fight.U.S. Secretary of State Lloyd Austin visited Israel Friday after Blinken's stop there Thursday in shows of support for Israel after the Hamas killings.\"We're rapidly moving to provide IDF (with) resources to include ammunition and interceptors to resupply (the) Iron Dome.These critical assets will help ensure Israel has what it needs to defend its cities and citizens,\" Austin said in a social media post.Netanyahu and Israeli officials say they are ready to go neighborhood-by-neighborhood to root out and crush Hamas.\"We will obliterate Hamas, we will triumph. It might take time, but we will end this war stronger than ever. 'May the Almighty cause the enemies who rise up against us to be struck down before them,'\" Netanyahu said Friday.The fate of Gaza An Israeli ground offensive will create urban warfare fighting potentially a kin to fights in Iraq, Somalia and Chechnya with plenty of peril of the Gaza's 2.1 million civilian population.The United Nations Relief and Works Agency said Israel's siege of Gaza has cut off food, water and power to Gaza with potential catastrophic consequences.\"It has become a matter of life and death. It is a must; fuel needs to be delivered now into Gaza to make water available for 2 million people,\" said Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner-General.No humanitarian supplies have been allowed into Gaza for a week now, the UN group said.The UN group said with power cut off Palestinians have been forced to use water from wells, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases.\"We need to truck fuel into Gaza now. Fuel is the only way for people to have safe drinking water. If not, people will start dying of severe dehydration, among them young children, the elderly and women. Water is now the last remaining lifeline.I appeal for the siege on humanitarian assistance to be lifted now,\" said Lazzarini.On the left, some progressives and critics of Israel are worried about civilian deaths in Gaza where 47% of the population are children.\"I am calling for immediate de-escalation and ceasefire to save countless civilian lives, no matter their faith or ethnicity. Our government must lead with compassion for all civilians. I believe in my heart that the majority of Americans want the killing and violence to stop. War crimes cannot be answered with war crimes,\" said U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan.\"Millions of people in Gaza-half of them children-have been given an impossible 24 hour evacuation order, but they have nowhere to go. They have been cut off from electricity, food, and water for days.Hospitals are running out of electricity to keep babies and the injured alive. The collective punishment of Palestinian civilians is a war crime, the confirmed use of white phosphorus bombs in Gaza is a war crime, yet there are no statements demanding these violations stop from the American political establishment.\" Pope Francis has called for a new mindset in the Middle East and holy land for Christians, Jews and Muslims.\"Terrorism and extremism do not help to reach a solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, but fuel hatred, violence, revenge, and only cause each to other suffer. The Middle East need a peace built on dialogue and the courage of fraternity,\" the Roman Catholic leader said.Thats a difficult sell with Israel's mourning the loss of life, including children, at the hands of Hamas and Palestinian militants hoping for a wider, regional conflict.U.S. support for Israel President Joe Biden has voiced steadfast support for Israel in the Gaza war but has also stressed the need to abide by the \"laws of war.\" Many Republicans have said they back Israel's offensive in Gaza.\"Israel has every right to use every force need to repel what just happened to them,\" said U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas.U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican representing the Eastern Shore, endorsed Roy's statement on social media and GOP presidential candidates such as former U.S. UN Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Florida Gov.Ron DeSantis also support the IDF's and Netanyahu's promises to crush and obliterate Hamas.\"Hamas showed no restraint when it slaughtered innocent Israelis. Hamas is evil and must be eradicated.We must stand with Israel-not just when it is hit, but also when it hits back,\" Haley said. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS I\n \nPalestinians leave their houses following Israeli airstrikes in Rafah refugee camp, southern Gaza Strip, Thursday, Oct. 12, 2023.\n \nOHAD ZWIGENBERG\n \nIsraeli tanks head towards the Gaza Strip border in southern Israel on Thursday, Oct.12, 2023.\n \nTWITTER/X\n \nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited Israel Friday in a show of U.S. support for the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israel Defense Forces hitting back at Hamas after Saturday's bloodshed by Hamas.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nSupporters of the religious party Jamaat-e-Islami take part in a rally against Israeli airstrikes on Gaza and to show solidarity with the Palestinians, in Lahore, Pakistan, Friday, Oct. 13, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If they are not grenade-throwers, Trump labels them RINOs, Republic In Name Only, one of his many favorite go-to insults, as if he is the sole arbiter of who gets to call themselves Republicans.Democrats blame Republicans, with the bright lights showing the reasons for that. Republicans control Congress but cannot control themselves, which means Congress is missing all the levers of power right now.They are not playing well with each other in the sandbox we call Congress.Time to get their heads out of the sandbox.Think outside the sandbox.What would you do if you were Hakeem Jefferies, the minority leader in Congress?So far, from the original battle to select a new speaker nearly a year ago-15 ballots finally installed a weak Kevin McCarthy, forced to make fake promises to the farthest of the far right - to the current rudderless ship of state, the Democrats have played it one way, entirely partisan, understandably.But our understanding has limits.In my field, conflict transformation, we might suggest getting far more inclusive, creative, and collaborative.The Democrats should be brainstorming toward solutions, not toward more adversarial dead-ends. They could easily expand on my little list: Caucus with moderate Democrats, especially those from safe districts, to see who is willing to take slight risks.Find and engage in private discussions with moderate Republicans to see about possible collaboration. Ironically, the Democrats who will virtually certainly win reelection are the best partners with Republicans who also will.Keep close count of the numbers as private talks produce willing members who want to restart Congress and actually get back to work.Find a moderate Republican who will agree to stand for speaker if guaranteed at least 217 votes.Go public, go big, get public opinion quickly on the side of those prepared to take power from the flamethrower extremists.Win the floor vote, get back to doing the business of the American people, not the firebrand business of the anti-democracy zealots.If we believe this type of thinking outside the sandbox is impossible, we quite literally are giving up and giving in to the worst ones, the ones who seek power over instead of power with.I do not claim my version of thinking outside the sandbox is the best, but I will vigorously claim that it's better than the status quo, the Great Sandbox Full Stop we see now.Tom H.

    "content": "Jordan shows he hasn't changed - Editorial\n\n October 19, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 679\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The St. Louis Post-Dispatch Editorial Board on Monday morning was prepared to take an unusual stance: The board determined that, whatever misgivings we have had about Missouri Congresswoman Ann Wagner in the past, she should be lauded for showing the courage to vow she will \"absolutely not\"support the House speakership ambitions ofright-wing demagogueJim Jordan ofOhio.But within about an hour after that board meeting, with Jordan and his allies signaling they would pursue a scorched-Earth strategy ofsiccing the MAGA base on any holdouts, Wagner did what she has done before after taking an uncharacteristically courageous stance: She folded like a cheap card table. In a written statement, she announced her support for the man she had chided just last week for his \"disgraceful\"behavior.So much for Wagner's \"courage.\"As a result ofher about-face,Jordan is somewhat more likely to win a vote to lead the House on what is sure to be a path to more dysfunction, vitriol and partisan hackery than even under former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.Jordan is one ofDonaldTrump's closest allies in the House, one who endorses and often mimics the former president's poisonous brand ofpopulism.He has lately been using his chairmanship ofthe HouseJudiciary Committee to press bogus claims about the \"weaponiza-tion\"ofthe federal government, attacking the FBI, theJustice Department and anyone else who has the audacity to confront Trump's chronic criminality.\"Everyone knows the fix is in,\"Jordan alleged during last month's hearings on first son Hunter Biden-providing, as usual, not a modicum ofevidence to go with his reckless rhetoric.That rhetoric apparently is even worse behind closed doors, according to an insider peek recently provided by none other than Rep. Wagner. TheTown and Country Republican was quoted in Politico strongly criticizingJordan after Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, a Wagner ally, failed to win the speakership last week.Scalise had earlier outvotedJordan for the caucus'nomination, after whichJor-dan \"gave the most disgraceful, ungracious -I can't call it a concession speech-of all time,Wagner told the news site. \"There were gasps in the room.\"That's Jordan, all right.Wagner further claimed she overheard as Jordan ordered Scalise to endorse him for speaker, then stormed out ofthe room after declaring, \"America wants me.\"His camp denies the exchange-but, again, it's classic, classless Jordan.Because of the GOP's narrow House majority, Jordan cannot win the speakership if more than four Republicans fail to support him. Wagner's opposition, then, was crucial.And, as it turns out, fleeting.\"Let me be clear, I am not, and will not, workwith Democrats as our Republican Conference comes together to elect a conservative Speaker ofthe House,\"Wagner said in her written statement released late Monday morning announcing her support forJordan in the speaker race, even as media accounts ofher briefstance against him ricocheted around the internet.Declaring that \"too much is at stake to hand control ofthe House over to radical liberal Democrats,\"Wagner proceeded to explain why she is now backing one ofthe most radical right-wingers in the chamber: \"I have always been a team player and supported our Republican nominees.\"Team player. No compromise with Democrats. Is this what Missouri and America want from their elected leaders-more bull-headed partisanship?Wagner wrote that she andJordan \"spoke at length\"Monday morning and that he \"has allayed my concerns about keeping the government open\"and \"consistent international support in times ofwar and unrest.\" That promise is worth precisely nothing coming SomJordan, aTrumper who is squishy on support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion and who just last weekwas hinting at threatening a government shutdown later this year as policy leverage.We will admit a little embarrassment at having been taken by surprise by Wagner's reversal. After all, in 2016, she disavowed her support for then-candidate Trump after his grotesque attitudes toward women were revealed in the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape - only to capitulate a month later and implore voters to support the genital-grabber.IfJordan ultimatelywins the speakership, the gridlock and chaos that will inevitably follow will make even the current House look functional by comparison. Ifit comes to that, the relatively moderate voters who populate Wagner's suburban St. Louis district shouldn't forget her role in enabling that chaos.REPRINTED FROM ThE ST.

Will | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 753\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Supreme Court on Oct. 2 spurned an opportunity to correct the second-worst mistake in its 233year history. If it had agreed to hear Ursula Newell-Davis's case, and had then decided it correctly, the court would have scrubbed a 150-year-old stain from its reputation.And it would have ended the injustice being done to Newell-Davis and those whom Louisiana's government is, for its convenience, preventing her from serving. Instead, the court, which is currently accused of insufficient fidelity to precedents, has preserved one that enables government-inflicted abridgments of individuals' rights.The court's worst mistake was Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), holding that Black people have no rights that White people are bound to respect. The Civil War made possible, in 1868, the 14th Amendment, which says no state shall abridge any American's \"privileges or immunities.\"The legislative history of the \"privileges or immunities\" clause shows that this phrase, written to protect newly freed Blacks from states' oppressions, affirmed various fundamental rights of national citizenship.These included those secured by the Bill of Rights, the 1866 Civil Rights Act and other unenumerated rights derived from the common law and acknowledged by the Ninth Amendment. (\"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\") In 1873, however, the \"privileges or immunities\" provision was all but nullified by a Supreme Court decision preserving a Louisiana government-created monopoly.Some Louisiana butchers contested the monopoly conferred by their state on a single slaughterhouse, saying this abridged their right to earn a living. Ohio's Rep. John Bingham, the foremost author of the 14th Amendment's first section, said it was to protect, inter alia, \"the liberty to work in an honest calling.\"This fundamental right, which is deeply rooted in this nation's history, is the antonym of the slavery to which the 14th Amendment responded.The court, however, held that \"privileges or immunities\" refers merely to a few narrow and obscure federal rights (e.g., protection on the high seas). And earlier this month, the court ratified this 1873 mistake, declining to hear a \"privileges or immunities\" challenge to another disreputable Louisiana restriction of economic liberty.Newell-Davis, a New Orleans social worker with undergraduate and master's degrees in social work and more than two decades of experience, wants to provide respite child-care services to parents who have special-needs children. But Louisiana's Health Department requires a \"Facility Need Review,\" which evaluates not a caregiver's competence but four bureaucrats' determination that the community needs the caregiver's services.By what standard does it measure need? Its own needs. Incredibly, the department says that this barrier to entry into the caregiving field \"self-evidently\" serves the public interest by giving department bureaucrats fewer caregivers to scrutinize. Never mind any shortage of Louisiana respite care. Newell-Davis is denied government's permission to practice her craft so that government can conserve its regulatory energies. She cannot work at all so that the bureaucrats can work less than they otherwise would.Because the court long ago eviscerated the straightforward \"privileges or immunities\" clause, occupational-licensing laws have been combated, awkwardly and without sufficient success, as violations of \"substantive due process.\" The theory is that the adjective \"due\" modifies the noun \"process\": Due process supposedly prevents capricious, arbitrary and irrational barriers to entry into this or that field. Courts have enforced this only intermittently and uneasily - partly because many are wary of unenumerated rights.In its unsuccessful (but unanswerable) petition urging the court to hear Newell-Davis's case, the Pacific Legal Foundation skewered Louisiana's nonsense: Under Louisiana's reasoning, government could economize election resources by having fewer polling places. It could enhance the administrative ease of education bureaucracies by educating fewer children.Louisiana's argument, the petition said, is that \"the Department can deprive people of constitutional rights because doing so allows it to oversee fewer people exercising their constitutional rights.\" The Pacific Legal Foundation unavailingly reminded today's court that 100 years ago the court said \"the right to earn a living\" is \"the very essence of the personal freedom that it is the purpose of the [14th] Amendment to secure.\"The court, deferring to its own blunders, chose to preserve a precedent that prevents robust responses to abuses such as Louisiana's abridgment ofNewell-Da-vis's rights. The court should have remembered James Madison's admonition in 1792 that it is \"not a just government. where arbitrary restrictions, exemptions and monopolies deny to part of its citizens [the] free use of their faculties, and free choice of their occupations.\"Reach George Willatgeorgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION\n \nSocial worker Ursula Newell-Davis in an undated photo outside her office in New Orleans. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Gag order in Trump trial is wrong - COMMENTARY",
    "date": "2023-10-20",
    "author": "David Harsanyi",
    "content": "Gag order in Trump trial is wrong - COMMENTARY\n\n October 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: David Harsanyi | Page: 6 | Section: Opinions \n \n 704\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n This week, U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan overseeing United States v. Donald Trump issued a gag order prohibiting a leading presidential candidate, Donald Trump, from engaging in speech aimed at \"government staff,\" among others, during his trial.Listen, I understand the disdain some conservatives feel for the former president. I share the sentiment.But if you're cheering on a judge who's inhibiting political speech on rickety grounds, you're no friend of \"democracy\" or the Constitution.\"Mr. Trump may still vigorously seek public support as a presidential candidate, debate policies and people related to that candidacy, criticize the current administration and assert his belief that this prosecution is politically motivated,\" Chutkan explained. \"But those critical First Amendment freedoms do not allow him to launch a pre-trial smear campaign against participating government staff, their families and foreseeable witnesses.\"Who is Chutkan to dictate the contours of a presidential candidate's political speech? What if one of the \"participating government staff\" or a family member is compromised by partisanship?Moreover, preemptively suggesting that without gagging, Trump will engage in a \"smear campaign\" is as prejudicial to the case as any of the inflammatory things Trump has thrown around. It implies that any accusation now aimed at prosecutors is untrue.Trump contends that he is being railroaded by special counsel Jack Smith, the longtime federal prosecutor who works on behalf of Democrats and President Joe Biden. You might believe the special counsel is a chaste defender of Lady Justice, but there's ample evidence that partisan considerations are in play. Fears of a politicized Justice Department are real. As we speak, the head of the Democratic Party is being mollycoddled by the state in a very similar case involving classified documents.Whatever the case, the Justice Department now plays a big part in Trump's campaign for the presidency - and probably his legal case, as well.If the state's accusations can be spread throughout the media before a trial, why can't the defendant speak openly, as well?In the name of fairness, Chutkan contends that Trump does not enjoy unfettered First Amendment rights because he might intimidate witnesses.It's already illegal to intimidate witnesses.Charge him if he does it. Laws already exist to cover all the other premises Smith has used to rationalize the gag order.The notion that a jury pool is going to be impartial in a trial involving a divisive former president, who is not only a leading contender for the presidency but one of the most famous people on Earth, is absurd. And the notion a D.C. jury pool will be impartial when it comes to Trump is fantastical. There is little that can be done about it. But further gagging the defendant only feeds, at the very minimum, the perception that this is all politically motivated.Establishment media informs us that the gag order is just \"narrow\" and meant to \"protect the integrity of the trial and the jury pool.\" In her Solomonic wisdom, Chutkan cut the state's request in half. A \"narrow\" gag order limiting free speech is still a gag order limiting free speech. The fact that Smith was seeking even broader limitations only makes Trump's claims more plausible.Smith has argued that Trump should not be afforded \"special treatment\" because he's a candidate. He's right. No one's right to defend themselves or to engage in speech should be inhibited, not even during trials (though any good lawyer will tell clients, for their own good, to shut up). Still, gag orders are almost always an unconstitutional prior restraint. For years, the American Civil Liberties Union and similar groups argued the same.I'm sure many people simply believe Trump deserves it. Think, though, about the precedent: Administrations can now launch prosecutions against political rivals - calibrated to take place in favorable cities and timed to coincide with elections - and then demand gag orders be implemented on those running for office. If you think they won't do it to others, you haven't been paying attention.David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist.

    "content": "Brothers in arms? - Biden $106B package ties together Israel and Ukraine wars, banks on bipartisan defense backing\n\n October 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; APG National Enterprise Editor | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1309\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n President Joe Biden's push for a $106 billion spending package that links U.S. support for Israel and its war against Hamas (and potentially Hezbollah) to continued backing for Ukraine's war against Russia faces some pushback from populist conservatives skeptical of the ladder and progressives resistant to the former.But those opponents also run into the political realities that majorities in Congress favor U.S. support for both wars - as well as defense spending overall.U.S. Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Montana, is among those on the right not wanting U.S. defense expenditures backing Israel tied at the hip to support for Ukraine. Rosendale joined U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tennessee, and three other conservatives wrote congressional leaders Friday urging rejection of the co-mingled package.\"We can't continue to fund a war in Europe that is heading into its third year. This president believes Americans are fine with passing a package that gives Ukraine another $60 billion while one of our closest allies, Israel, gets only $10 billion. That's just not reality. We also can't simply put more taxpayer money toward the Biden administration's failed immigration policies that have led to a crisis at our Southern border instead of a separate comprehensive border package. We need to let these bills stand alone and vote on them individually\" said Burchett, Rosendale and their cohorts.That includes U.S. Rep Mark Green, R-Tennessee, whose name has been floated to fill the vacant U.S. House Speaker position, paralyzing the GOP-controlled chamber.\"Aid to Israel and aid to Ukraine should not be tied into the same package - period,\" Green said.BIDEN'S ARGUMENTBiden's war spending package requests $61.4 billion for Ukraine (58.5% of its total expenditure) in its war against invading Russian forces.The U.S. has already approved $113 billion in weapons, intelligence and financial support for Ukraine since Russia invaded its Eastern European neighbor in February 2022, according to the Center for International & Strategic Studies.The proposed package allocates $14.3 billion in new military support for Israel in its war with Hamas (and potentially other Islamic militants) after the Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel that targeted civilians, including children.Israel already receives $3.3 billion in U.S. foreign aid annually making it the leading long-term beneficiary ofWashington weapons and assistance. ( Jordan and Egypt also receive significant aid from the U.S.).The White House also wants $10 billion for humanitarian needs in the war zones and $7.4 billion for Taiwan as it faces continued saber rattling from China as well as other Asian allies.In his national address Thursday night, Biden made the case that Israel's war in Gaza after Hamas attacks killed 1,400 people (including close to 450 children) at kibbutzim and a musical festival are linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\"Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy - completely annihilate it,\" Biden said.\"You know, history has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. They keep going, and the cost and the threats to America and to the world keep rising,\" Biden continued.The war spending measure will rely on overwhelming support in Washington for Israel and a Congress where defense spending enjoys bipartisan backing\"The radical Islamic terrorist group Hamas must be eliminated by Israel after the genocidal actions of Hamas and their allies last week. America and the world has to give Israel and the IDF as much time as it needs to accomplish that - for the sake of all humanity,\" said U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican representing Maryland's Eastern Shore.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, voices similar sentiments.\"If you allow Hamas to continue to exist as is, the same thing will happen again and we have to do everything to prevent that from happening,\" Schumer said.Most of the resistance to Biden's push and the echoing drums war comes from progressive Democrats critical of Israel's treatment of Palestinians.Some Christian leaders, such as Pope Francis and the World Council of Churches, have also called for ceasefire and pullback on the war in the Holy Land.\"The bloodshed, slaughter and suffering of innocent people on all sides must stop,\" said Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury and head Anglican churches.More than 4,100 Palestinians (including more than 1,600 children) have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war as Israel Defense Forces besiege and bomb Gaza after the Oct. 7 attacks, according to Palestinian groups.A Christian hospital was hit by an errant Islamic Jihad rocket Tuesday, according IDF and Biden, while an a Medieval Orthodox church built in the 5th century saw its compound hit Thursday by an Israeli airstrike of a nearby militant post, according to Greek Orthodox officials, the World Council of Churches and former GOP congressman Justin Amash, who lost relatives in the blast.U.S. DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASEDuring his primetime speech, Biden emphasized the domestic economic and financial benefits of the $106 billion package to the defense industry and its workforce. He said the weapons sent to Ukraine are from U.S. military \"stockpiles\" and when new money is spent it on replenishing those inventories with weapons built domestically in Arizona, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and other states.That hits homes with the domestic economic impacts of U.S. defense spending which is approaching $1 trillion annually. The latest defense spending bill passed by Congress this summer totaled a record $886 billion in spending.ALI MAHMOUDPalestinians walk by buildings destroyed in the Israeli bombardment on al-Zahra, on the outskirts of Gaza City, Friday, Oct. 20, 2023. (AP Photo/Ali Mahmoud)A report by the Congressional Research Service on the U.S. \"defense industrial base\" issued Oct. 12 says the defense contractors more than 1.1. million employees nationally. Just the five biggest U.S. defense contractors (Maryland-based Lockheed Martin, RTX Raytheon), General Dynamics, Boeing and Northrop Grumman) have combined market cap values of $450 billion, according to CRS.Many lawmakers from both political parties are promising to work on passage of Biden's war spending package.\"As chairman of the committee that sets our military's budget, Senator Tester will be working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to deliver a package that invests in our ability to stay ahead of the threat from China, secures the border, takes care of our service members and their families, and provides aid to our allies.\" a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Defense SubcommitteeSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, agreed.\"The Senate will work its will to invest in America's own defense, help Israel defend itself against Iran-backed terrorism, equip Ukraine for victory over Russia, shore up Taiwan on the leading edge of our crucial competition with communist China, and restore sanity to southern border enforcement,\" McConnell said in a statement regarding Biden's supplemental budget request.The package also includes $13.6 billion for border security as the flow of migrants, human trafficking and illegal drugs continues across the U.S. border with Mexico.U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mon-tana, and other Republicans have been pressing Biden on the border after he undid hardline immigration policies imposed by former President Donald Trump and migrations have increased due to economic inequalities and social upheavals (as well as extreme weather events) in Latin America, Haiti and Africa.\"The wide-open southern border has already proven to hurt Montana communities - now, it's a national security threat. We must secure our southern border,\" Daines said in a statement referring to the flow of fentanyl and worries about terrorists entering the U.S. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS/PETROS GIANNAKOURIS\n \nAn Israeli woman looks at photos of Israelis missing and held captive in Gaza, displayed on a wall in Tel Aviv, on Friday, Oct. 20, 2023.

Ben Cardin (D-Md.) got underway, albeit with a light start, at a candidate town hall.Candidates were invited to the Comfort Inn hotel in Bowie to hear what some U.S. senatorial candidates had to say at the town hall hosted by the Maryland Federation of the National Association of Retired Federal Employees.The event featured a question-and-answer period with multiple pre-prepared questions during 45-minute sessions. Only two of the current nine registered candidates showed up, though.\"There are no gotcha questions,\" Gary Roundtree, president of Maryland NARFE chapter, said before the start of the event.About 70 people attended the event to hear from independent candidate Emmanuel Osuchukwu and Democratic candidate Rep.David Trone (D-Md., 6th).The event was also scheduled for appearances by current Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks (D), who is not yet listed as filed on the state elections board website but who has announced her candidacy, and fellow Democratic candidate Brian Frydenborg, who did not attend.A fourth Democratic candidate, Juan Dominguez, missed the event due to a COVID-19 diagnosis, while the lone Republican candidate invited, Ray Bly, also did not attend due to an illness, according to organizers.The crowded field of candidates will vie in next year's election to replace Cardin, a career politician who announced he is retiring after holding one of the state's two Senate seats since 2007.Osuchukwu, a former union president and federal contractor from Baltimore, made term limits for congressional offices a focal point of his campaign.\"If we get term limits, then the citizens take back control,\" Osuchukwu said. \"Right now, most of the politicians are just serving themselves and the lobbyists and the globalists.\" He called for a maximum of two-terms for members in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, saying that many of the problems such as poor infrastructure comes from career politicians that take more money for themselves than for the people.On dealing with crime, Osuchukwu said he would fold local police forces into the Maryland State Police to give more flexibility to deal with problems.Trone, who was born in Cheverly and owns a liquor store with his brother, equated the issue of crime and gun violence with the need for improved education in the country.\"A lot of the gun violence challenge goes right back to education,\" Trone said.Trone added that he supported the creation of a teacher academy that would train teachers and pay off their student loans as long as the teachers spend at least four years teaching.The idea was a way to help bring federal dollars to assist teaching initiatives at the local level.Additional Senate candidates include Democrats Marcellus Crews of Capitol Heights, Steven Henry Seuferer of Montgomery Village and Andrew Jaye Wildman of Westminster, Republican Lorie R. Friend and Moshe Y. Landman, who is running with the Green Party, according to the Maryland Board of Elections website. \n \n Caption: LKINSEY JR./SOUTHERN MARY LAND NEWS\n \nLarry Walton, Region II vice president of the National Association of Retired Federal Employees, left, sits in on a town hall interview with Rep.

    "content": "Lost in the rubble - How how high is the death toll in Gaza? - Biden, U.S don't trust casualty numbers from Palestinian health agency in Hamas-controlled war zone\n\n October 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1567\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n War casualty figures in Gaza - including the number of children killed - frequently cited by international groups and media outlets are being questioned by U.S. officials, including by President Joe Biden, because they are coming from a Palestinian health agency in the Hamas-controlled territory.The dispute comes as Israel Defense Forces step up already intense bombing of Gaza with ground attacks in the Hamas-controlled Palestinian area along the Mediterranean Sea.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday IDF ground forces have entered the \"gates of evil\", announcing the next phases of attacks against Hamas inside Gaza, which has a population of more than 2 million people.A sustained ground invasion faces grim realities of urban warfare and a rising death toll. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said Friday Israel's \"ground war\" had begun with power and internet outages across Gaza and increased tank and artillery fire.\"Israel just launched a ground war on Gaza. Outcome will be a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions for years to come,\" Safadi said in a statement on Twitter/X.'THEY'RE NOT RELIABLE'The Palestinian Health Authority is the main information source from the Palestinian side for deaths and injuries during the war between Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hamas after the latter's Oct. 7 attacks inside Israel.Israeli officials said those attacks killed more than 1,400 people (including close to 450 children) and Hamas took more than 220 hostages. U.S. officials said 33 American citizens (many with dual Israeli citizenship) died in the attacks and there are also a still an unconfirmed, small number of Americans missing or also held hostage by Hamas The Palestinian Health Authority reported Friday more than 7,300 people have died in Gaza since the IDF started - including more than 2,900 children. Those numbers are going to expected to rise as the war continues, more ground battles ensue and Gaza civilians (close to half of them children) continue to get caught in the crossfires of the Holy Land war.But American and Israeli officials - including Biden - question how accurate the fatality figures are from the health group which is under the auspices of Hamas and its military and governmental control over Gaza.\"I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed. I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's the price of waging a war,\" Biden said Oct. 25.\"I think we should be incredibly careful. I think - well, not 'we' - the Israelis should be incredibly careful to be sure that they're focusing on going after the folks that are propagating this war against Israel. And it's against their interest when that doesn't happen,\" Biden said. \"But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.\" John Kirby, the White House's national security spokesman, reiterated Biden's point during a media session Thursday.\"We absolutely know that the death toll continues to rise in Gaza.Of course, we know that. But what we're saying is that we shouldn't rely on numbers put forth by Hamas and the Ministry of Health,\" Kirby said.Kirby also pointed to the bombing of the Al Ahli Arab Hospital, which is operated by the Anglican church and Episcopal Archdiocese of Jerusalem, on Oct. 14 which the U.S. and IDF says was ht by an errant Islamic Jihad rocket.Palestinian officials blamed Israel for the Christian hospital blast and reported a disputed much higher fatality figure.\"Well, do you remember that attack on the hospital? And what did the Gaza Ministry of Health put out?Something like 500? They slapped the number of 500 on it, you know, within the hour of - of that attack. And, of course, they - the same ministry of health said it was an Israeli airstrike, so we know that's not true. And we've now since found out that the numbers aren't that high, either. They never got up to 500,\" Kirby said.\"They're just not reliable,\" he continued.'UNDER THE RUBBLE'In response to the doubts, the Gazabased health ministry released names, genders and ages of residents who have died in the war since Oct. 7.Media outlets as well as international groups frequently cite the health ministry numbers with some defending their accuracy. They also argue the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza should not get lost in other disputes.The United National Relief and Works Agency cites the Palestinian health agency numbers and said there are more than 1,500 people in Gaza missing \"under the rubble of destroyed buildings - including 870 children.\" Save the Children International, Amnesty International and other relief groups also cite health ministry numbers as they worry about the situation in Gaza, including the spread of diseases.Defense for Children, a Palestinian group, said the number of deaths in Gaza reported by the healthy ministry, could be lower than the reality of the ground saying there are missing persons \"under the rubble\" of the war and who have not been confirmed as dead or alive.DOC also blames the U.S. for the deaths.\"Israeli forces are actively committing the crime of genocide against Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,\" said Brad Parker, attorney and senior policy adviser at DCIP. \"The United States is not simply standing by, but is actively enabling and supporting the gravest crime under international law making the United States complicit. Israeli warplanes are entirely U.S. sourced and the munitions killing Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are overwhelmingly American-made weapons.\" The U.S. backs Israel in the war and has moved two aircraft carrier groups, additional get squadrons and 2,900 troops - including a Marine rapid response force to the region. Biden wants Congress to approve $14 billion in military aid for Israel as part of a larger $106 billion war package that includes money for Ukraine in it war with Russia. The U.S. already sends Israel $3.3 billion annually in military aid along with significant outlays to Egypt and Jordan, who refuse to take Gaza refugees.The DOC group said the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire with lack of potable drinking water and more than 8,000 new COVID cases among Palestinian residents. \"Many people have resorted to drinking salt water from agricultural wells,\" the Palestinian group said.Oxfam International worries about the spread of cholera and other diseases with water treatment and sewage shutdown because of the war. Relief and groups say the situation in Gaza which has a population of more than 2.2 million (close to half of which are children) is dire.\"The situation for civilians is already intolerable. Our staff are telling us that in some cases, there are up to 70 people crammed into a single room.\" Amitabh Behar, Oxfam International's executive director.'SLEEPING WITHIN'On Friday, Oct. 27, Pope Francis, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Pierbattista Pizzabella and other Christian leaders held a day of prayer calling for peace and the end violence and war in the Holy Land.The World Council of Churches and Patriarchs and Heads of Churches in Jerusalem are also calling for de-escalations of the war and the protection of churches and other places of refugees in Gaza. There are between 1,000 and 1,300 Christians in the heavily Muslim Palestinian territory. Another 50,000 Christians live in the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to the U.S. State Department.The push comes after Orthodox church leaders and the WCC say an IDF airstrike aimed at nearby Hamas installation struck the compound of the St. Porphyrius Church Oct. 19, which was built in the 5th century and is one of the oldest churches in the world.\"These blasts led to the sudden and catastrophic collapse of two church halls around the scores of refugees, including women and children, sleeping within,\" according to a statement by the Patriarchs and Heads of Churches in Jerusalem. \"Dozens found themselves instantly crushed beneath the rubble.\" Eighteen people have died, including nine children, according to WCC.The Holy Land Christian churches have also called for more humanitarian aid be allowed into Gaza, for all sides to stop targeting civilians and for a ceasefire.HAMAS' FAULTThe IDF says misfired rockets from Hamas and other Islamic militants are resulting in deaths and injuries in Gaza, including the Anglican hospital blast, and that Hamas has stolen or hoarded fuel that could be use by hospitals and to operate water treatment plants and sewage pumping stations.\"Hamas is determining the level of the humanitarian crisis by not handing over that fuel to the United Nations,\" an IDF spokesman said Oct. 25.The day before, the IDF posted images of fuel storage facilities operated by Hamas in response to UNRWA pushes for fuel shipments into Gaza during the wartime siege.\"These fuel tanks are inside Gaza,\" IDF said pointing to reconnaissance photos and responding to the UN group's bid to get fuel included in relief shipments. \"They contain more than 500,000 liters of fuel.Ask Hamas if you can have some.\" The Israelis also posted social media graphics and information contending Hamas has underground facilities beneath the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Hamas continues to hold more than 220 Israelis (as well as some Americans with dual Israeli citizenship) in Gaza as leverage as the war and IDF bombardments rage and intensify. \n \n Caption: ABED KHALED/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nA wounded Palestinian woman runs following Israeli airstrikes that targeted her neighbourhood in Gaza City, Monday, Oct. 23, 2023.\n \nNASSER NASSER/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nPalestinian protesters hold posters and chant anti Israel slogans during a demonstration in solidarity with the Gaza Strip, in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Friday, Oct. 27, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Light shall triumph over darkness' - Netanyahu, U.S. House Speaker, conservative Christians invoke Bible in Israel's war against Hamas\n\n November 6, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1695\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The war in the Holy Land and Israel Defense Forces new ground invasion of Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas have sparked increased worries about a rise in antisemitism and threats of terrorism on U.S. soil, stepped up pushes to combine American military aid for Israel with more weapons shipments to Ukraine in its battles with Russia and emotional invocations of biblical wars and spiritual postulations.Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Middle East war is a call \"to fight the barbarians\" after Islamic militants from Hamas attacks on Oct. 7 killed 1,400 Israelis including women and children.Netanyahu invoked the ancient Israeli enemies the Amalek in rallying support for the invasion of Gaza and the IDF's bid to dismantle Hamas after the Oct. 7 bloodshed in southern Israel.\"You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible,\" Netanyahu said during a speech Sunday in Hebrew referencing Old Testament adversaries to the Israelites after they left enslavement in Egypt.The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe who attacked the Israelis, according to Old Testament books of Deuteronomy, First Samuel and Exodus. Netanayhus reference is from Deuteronomy. It is viewed by some as justification for the IDF's siege, bombing campaign and now invasion of Hamas-controlled Gaza after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks.\"Now go and smite the Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass,\" reads First Samuel Chapter 15 Verse 3, which has been cited since Netanyahu's speech.White House national security spokesman John Kirby was asked about Netanyahu comparing the Hamas attacks to the ancient biblical rivals.\"I'm afraid I'm not qualified to speak much on biblical history here,\" Kirby said during a briefing Tuesday, where he said a formal ceasefire pushed by progressives and relief groups would only benefit Hamas and that Israel is not embarking on some kind of ethnic cleansing campaign against the Palestinians.\"That is not what we are seeing Israel desire to do here. They are going after Hamas terrorists. They are going after the leadership that attacked their country on Oct. 7 in a gross and barbaric fashion. They are not interested in genocidal activity toward the people of Gaza,\" Kirby said.Palestinian authorities under the auspices of Hamas report more than 8,500 people in Gaza have died since the start of the Holy Land war - including more than 3,800 children. Israeli and U.S. officials question the veracity of casualty numbers coming from groups in Gaza controlled by Hamas.More than 1,400 Israelis (including close to 450 children as well as 33 Americans with dual Israeli citizenship) were killed by Hamas on Oct. 7, according to Israeli and U.S. officials. There are more than 220 Israelis as well as under 10 Americans with dual citizenship held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.'A TIME FOR WAR'Netanyahu also invoked another Old Testament verse in dismissing calls for ceasefire or even temporary stoppages unless the latter involves a release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.\"Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism. That will not happen,\" Netanyahu said Monday two days after Israel Defense Forces started a sustained ground invasion of Hamas-controlled Gaza. \"Ladies and gentleman, the Bible says that there is a time for peace and a time for war. This is a time for war.\" Netanyahu said, referencing Ecclesiastes Chapter 3.Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also thinks a ceasefire is a bad idea - in contrast to pushes by progressive Democrats on college campuses and in Congress.\"People who are calling for a ceasefire now do not understand Hamas, that is not possible. It would be such a gift to Hamas because they would spend whatever time there was a ceasefire in effect rebuilding their armaments, creating stronger positions to be able to fend off an eventual assault by the Israelis,\" Clinton told CBS News.President Joe Biden as well as Kirby have voiced support for pausing the war to get humanitarian aid in and potentially hostages out of the war zone. That has prompted questions on the difference between a ceasefire and a \"pause\" and whether Biden is reacting to progressives and American Muslims opposition to the war, and U.S. support for Israel.On the Hamas side, Orthodox Jewish incursions in and around the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which is also home to Jewish holy site Temple Mount, have been used as rallying cries for Islamic militants - including before the Oct. 7 massacres.'STAND WITH ISRAEL'The war and IDF's military campaign against Hamas in Gaza have also split Christians between Evangelicals as well as some conservative American Catholics with full-throated backing of Israel contrasted against calls for a ceasefire and de-escalation of violence from Pope Francis, the World Council of Churches and Christian churches in the Holy Land.New U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, invoked the Bible and his Evangelical Christian beliefs in backing Israel in the time ofwar.\"As a Christian, I know and we believe that the Bible teaches very clearly that we are to stand with Israel. That God will bless the nation that blesses Israel and we should pray for peace in Jerusalem,\"Johnson said, calling the war against Hamas as a battle of\"good over evil\", \"light over darkness.\"He also opposes a ceasefire or pause saying Hamas started the bloodshed Oct. 7.That mirrors Netanyahu's remarks after the launch of the ground war in Gaza.\"We are the people of the light, they are the people of darkness, and light shall triumph over darkness,\" the Israeli prime minister said, adding \"we will realize the prophecy of Isaiah\"That sentiment is echoed by a number of high-profile Evangelical Christian broadcasters - including Trinity Broadcast Network which aired a segment with talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw - calling for stedfast U.S. support for Israel after the Hamas attacks and criticizing anti-Israel protests at U.S. universities that have bled into antisemitism and racism. The clip has generated more than 2.1 million views on social media.'WAR IS ALWAYS DEFEAT'On the other side of the Christian perspectives on the war, the World Council of Churches, Pope Francis, the Anglican church and Christian churches in the Holy Land, which are made up mostly of Palestinians, have made continued calls for ceasefires, for Hamas to release its hostages and for ending the bloodshed.\"Let the arms cease. Stop, brothers and sisters: war is always a defeat - always, always,\" Pope Francis said in a social media statement. The pope also wants to return to efforts to a two-state solutions for Israel and the Palestinians and wants a \"special status\" for Israel. The latter faces opposition from Netanyahu as well as from U.S. Evangelicals Holy Land church leaders are also upset with some U.S. Evangelicals' unequivocal support for Israel pointing to humanitarian plights in Gaza and an estimated 18 deaths at a 5th Century Orthodox Church compound in Gaza due to an IDF bombing of nearby Hamas installation and the humanitarians. There are between 1,000 and 1,300 Christians in Gaza and another 50,000 in the West Bank, according to the U.S. State Department and church figures.The Bethlehem Bible College (which is located in Jesus' birthplace), East Jerusalem YMCA, YWCA of Palestine, Arab Orthodox Society ofJerusalem and other Christian groups posted their concerns n an open letter posted Oct. 20 on Change.org.That letter does not criticize Egypt, Jordan and other Arab countries for their resistance to accepting Palestinian refugees. It also does not specifically address Hamas' holding more than 220 Israeli, American and other hostages in Gaza and the civilian massacres on Oct. 7.Roman Catholic Cardinal and Patriarch of the Holy Land Pierbattista Pizzaballa told Palestinian Christians to stay strong in their faith and spirit in an Oct. 25 video.\"Do not lose hope or courage. Remember the Lord is with you and we are with you. Remain strong,\" the Catholic leader in the Holy Land said.Within Catholic ranks, there are also some divergent views on the war including some strong support for the IDF's vow to bring down Hamas.\"Israel is fighting for its very existence against an evil, and I use that word quite deliberately, an evil foe.,\" said Father Benedict Kiely, founder of Nasarean.org, said on the EWTN Catholic television network Friday. \"The old saying is once they destroy the Jews they will turn to the Christians. Old saying is when the Saturday people are dealt with then the Sunday people will be dealt with. That's us.\"Worries about antisemitism There are also concerns about increases in terrorism threats and antisemitic threats and violence - including on college campus where there have been anti-war, anti-Israel protests.U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and U.S. Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, are part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who wrote the Biden administration to make combating antisemitism a priority.FBI Director Christopher Wray said Tuesday at a congressional hearing that the Holy Land war and Israel's attacks in Gaza against Hamas after the Islamic group's Oct. 7 attacks have increased concerns about terrorism threats against the U.S.The Biden administration - via Vice President President Kamala Harris - has also launched a new effort to combat Islamophobia Nov. 2, to combat \"surge of hate in America.\" \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS A woman, with a photograph of a child who was abducted during the unprecedented Hamas attack on Israel, hands out yellow ribbons to passing drivers in central Tel Aviv, Israel, Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2023.

The ship is equipped with tomahawk missiles, torpedoes, guns and a phalanx close-in weapons system.More than 300 sailors serve aboard USS Chung-Hoon. Their jobs are highly specialized, requiring both dedication and skill. The jobs range from maintaining engines to handling weaponry along with a multitude of other assignments that keep the ship mission-ready at all times, according to Navy officials.With 90 percent of global commerce traveling by sea and access to the internet relying on the security of undersea fiber optic cables, Navy officials continue to emphasize that the prosperity of the United States is directly linked to trained sailors and a strong Navy.\"Our mission remains timeless - to provide our fellow citizens with nothing less than the very best Navy: fully combat ready at all times, focused on warfighting excellence, and committed to superior leadership at every single level,\" said Adm.Mike Gilday, chief of naval operations. \"This is our calling. And I cannot imagine a calling more worthy.\" Serving in the Navy means Young-Oliveira is part of a team that is taking on new importance in America's focus on strengthening alliances, modernizing capabilities, increasing capacities and maintaining military readiness in support of the National Defense Strategy.\"The Navy, along with our allies, supports national security by defending freedom, preserving economic prosperity, and keeping the seas open and free for countries around the world,\" said Young-Oliveira.Young-Oliveira and the sailors they serve with have many opportunities to achieve accomplishments during their military service.\"My proudest accomplishment so far has been completing a deployment,\" Young-Oliveira said. \"I never imagined myself in that environment and what it would take to get there, so I'm proud of myself for persevering through it.\" As Young-Oliveira and other sailors continue to train and perform missions, they take pride in serving their country in the U.S.Navy.\"Serving in the Navy means I have the opportunity to protect our nation,\" said Young-Oliveira. \"In return, the Navy trains me in a trade and offers free college. I'm here to build a career for myself. If I want to stay in, I have that option. However, if I don't want to stay in, the Navy has given me the skills to continue building my career as a civilian.\" Young-Oliveira is grateful to others for helping make a Navy career possible.\"I'd like to thank my mom for supporting me, not only as a kid but also while I was transitioning into the Navy,\" added Young-Oliveira. \"I also want to thank my dad for guiding me into the Navy, because Lord knows he didn't want me to join the Army.

    "content": "FBI headquarters move to Maryland faces new headwinds\n\n November 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Fatema Hosseini And Josie Jack; Capital News Service | Page: 18 | Section: News \n \n 716\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - The Biden administration's announcement that the new FBI headquarters would be constructed in Greenbelt, Maryland, was met Thursday with criticism from the agency's director and allegations of corruption in the selection process from Virginia lawmakers.On Capitol Hill, a spending measure that would be a vehicle for helping to pay for the new FBI headquarters was pulled from the House floor, part of a broader battle among lawmakers ahead of a looming Nov. 17 government shutdown.The latest developments suggest that the years-long debate over the location of the new FBI headquarters seems to be continuing, notwithstanding Wednesday's announcement by the General Services Administration.FBI Director Christopher Wray said there was a \"potential conflict of interest\" in the agency headquarters decision, writing in an internal email Thursday to FBI employees, according to multiple media sources. Wray said he believed one senior GSA executive may have acted in favor of Greenbelt's selection.Wray said the FBI has \"concerns about fairness and transparency in the process and GSA's failure to adhere to its own site selection plan.\" Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia) said on a call with reporters that Virginia lawmakers will be calling for a Department of Justice inspector general's review due to alleged \"corruption\" in the selection process.\"The fact that you've got three career professionals, two representing GSA and one representing the FBI, coming together even with the new criteria and still choosing Virginia only to have that overwritten by a political appointee is outrageous,\" Warner said. \"This is the kind of behavior I expected from the Trump administration, but I think we all expect better from the current administration.\" Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Virginia) whose district includes the rejected Springfield site for the headquarters, said in a statement that the \"GSA has shamelessly caved to political pressure,\" and that the agency did not warn lawmakers in advance about the decision.Amidst these allegations, Maryland's state and federal officials hailed the move.\"This is a historic moment for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and our nation,\" said a joint statement from the officials, who dubbed themselves \"Team Maryland.\" \"For decades, the dilapidated J. Edgar Hoover Building has failed to meet the FBI's operational needs, which has undermined our national security.\" The 61 acres in Greenbelt emerged as the preferred location due to its proximity to multiple transportation networks, including Metro, and other federal facilities, the ease of developing the now-vacant site and the desirability of promoting equity, according to the GSA. Greenbelt had the highest score for all the mentioned criteria compared to the other two sites, the GSA said.Greenbelt also represents the lowest cost to taxpayers, with an estimated cost of $26.2 million for site acquisition and preparation, GSA said. That compared to over $100 million for a site in Landover, Maryland, and $64 million for the Springfield site.President Joe Biden in March issued his fiscal 2024 budget plan under which $3.5 billion would come from a proposed Federal Capital Revolving Fund, and $645 million from earlier appropriations for the GSA.In addition to moving about 7,500 people from the FBI's headquarters to Greenbelt, the GSA is planning to keep up to 1,000 FBI employees in a federal facility in downtown Washington.But prospects for funding the FBI headquarters move are hazy at the moment. That is because Congress is deadlocked over spending bills, even as a current stopgap funding bill expires on Nov. 17.On Wednesday evening, after the FBI move was made public, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, proposed an amendment to an appropriations bill to block the move.While the amendment to the financial services and general government spending bill failed, the FBI headquarters decision was one of the reasons House Republican leaders pulled the overall bill from the floor, Roll Call reported.The establishment of the FBI headquarters is poised to bring significant economic benefits to the region, including job creation and infrastructure improvements, local, state and federal officials said.\"After a long push from Team Maryland, the FBI Headquarters is officially coming to Prince George's County!\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, tweeted.\"This is the right decision - it's a win for the FBI's mission, for taxpayers, and for our goal of ensuring federal investments advance equity in our communities.\" \n \n Caption: BRIDGET BYRNE/CA PITOL NEWS SERVICE\n \nThe FBI's headquarters in the nation's capital, occupying an aging and outdated building, is slated to move to Greenbelt, Maryland. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It was coming my way with shrapnel. One of the jet engines wouldn't start so that left us with three engines instead of four. So we hit the runway going full blast.\" Then, he recalled what fellow service members had asked him after the landing. \"'Crew are you OK? Anyone been hit?' My engineer was scraped, but not bleeding too bad. 'Do the tires look flat? Any fuel leaking?' No, so it looks like we are in pretty good shape,\" he said.After an inspection, Van Slambrook learned there were 200 holes in the airplane.The story is one of many the veteran gathered as he flew for nearly 30 years in the Air Force, from 1956 to 1984.He grew up in southern Michigan, and even as a young man in the Air Force, he displayed skills that put him ahead of his age or rank.He made the choice to learn to fly multi engine airplanes, which put him on track to do supply runs.In 1962, Van Slambrook found himself in Minot, North Dakota and in the middle of the Cold War. He had to get the alert and be in the air in 10 minutes.Van Slambrook would fly alongside larger planes and refuel them mid-flight without the larger plane ever needing to land. Performing jet to jet refueling in the air while flying, became routine. His crew consisted of two pilots, two engineers, a navigator and a loadmaster.\"I flew over 10,000 hours in that airplane, the Boeing 707. We had tanks in it and a boom operator who flew the boom. We gave him a good platform, and he hit the mark,\" Van Slambrook said.\"We could do it any weather, turbulence or at night.\" Before telling his stories, Van Slambrook shared his thoughts about Veteran's Day.He makes a point of going to Perry Point VA Medical Center to see the wounded soldiers, who can't get out of bed or are in wheelchairs.\"Think about the people, the veterans who have gone before me.They have given so much.

    "content": "Democrats link support for Israel war money to minimizing civilian deaths in Hamas-controlled Gaza - Senators also want to $10B in humanitarian aid, voice support for two-state solution in Holy Land\n\n November 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 848\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A group of Democratic U.S. senators - including those representing the Delmarva peninsula -want President Joe Biden to press Israel on its war strategy against Hamas in Gaza and to provide more information on efforts to secure the release of hostages held by the Islamic terror group and how to minimize civilian Palestinian casualties as Congress considers a war spending package for both the war in the Holy Land and continued American backing of Ukraine's war against invading Russian forces.Democratic lawmakers also want to make sure $10 billion in humanitarian spending is in the $106 billion package making its way through Congress. The package allocates more than $61 billion for U.S. military, intelligence and financial for Ukraines another $14 billion for Israel in its war with Hamas after the Oct. 7 terror attacks as well as money for border security and in Asia where China continues to saber rattle against Taiwan.Both moves come young voters and progressives criticize Biden and U.S. support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel Defense Forces' war in Gaza to \"destroy\" Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks killed more than 1,400 people including children. Some polls show younger voters and progressives voicing more sympathy for the Palestinians in the Middle East war.The Senate Democrats writing Biden stress their support for Israel and the need to dismantle Hamas in their letter to Biden. They also back U.S. support for Ukraine in it war.'ALL POSSIBLE MEASURES TO PROTECT CIVILIANS IN GAZA'U.S. Sens. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Tom Carper of Delaware and Tim Kaine of Virginia joined other Democrats in pressing Biden to get more details from the Israeli's about their war plans against Hamas and what they are doing to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza.Palestinian agencies Gaza - which are controlled by Hamas - said more than 10,000 people have died in Gaza since the war began last month, including more than 4,100 children.Biden and the White House and the IDF have cast some doubts on the veracity of the casualty figures coming from Hamas aligned agencies in Gaza.\"We believe the United States should immediately provide Israel with the funding it needs to replenish its defensive systems, including Iron Dome and other air defense capabilities. But to better understand the efficacy ofU.S. funding that supports Israel's operations inside Gaza, we respectfully ask your team to provide us with information relative to these two clear U.S. priorities: supporting an Israeli strategy that will effectively degrade and defeat the threat from Hamas and taking all possible measures to protect civilians in Gaza,\" the senators write in a Nov. 8 letter.They also want more details from the U.S. administration and Israelis how the IDF is abiding by the \"laws of war\" and is putting adequate focus on securing the release of240 Israeli hostages (including a handful with dual American citizenship) taken by Hamas back to Gaza after the Oct. 7 carnage.The Democrats also say support for additional Israel assistance is also tied to a \"long-term vision for peace, security and Palestinian self-determination in the form of a two-state solution\" and getting humanitarian aid into Gaza.A number of the lawmakers signing the missive to Biden - including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont - have pressed for a ceasefire in the war.Biden has gotten Netanyahu to agree to short humanitarian pauses.Israel and conservative Republicans are opposed to a ceasefire or prolonged pause saying that will allow Hamas to recover from the current ground and air onslaught. Netanyahu said the short pauses are not a ceasefire.\"We will not stop. I repeat: There will be no entry of fuel or workers, and there will be no ceasefire without the release of our hostages,\" Netanyahu said Nov. 7.$10B IN HUMANITARIAN AIDVan Hollen, Kaine, Sanders, Warren and Democratic U.S. Sens. Mark Warner ofVirginia, John Fetterman and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden of Oregon also want to make sure $10 billion in humanitarian aid - including for Palestinians in Hamas-controlled Gaza -is part of the big $106 billion Ukraine and Israel war package.They wrote U.S. Senate leaders Friday making their case \"We urge you to ensure that the final package for the national security supplemental includes the full $10 billion in humanitarian assistance requested by the President, including for refugee and emergency food,' the senators said in their letter.The Democrats lauded Ukraine's \"heroic struggle\" against Russia, said the money will also go to help humanitarian needs in the Eastern European war as well as crises in Burma, Sudan, Syria - and Gaza.Again, Israel and its GOP allies have opposed requests for fuel supplies to be included in humanitarian aid arguing that Hamas has and will steal those supplies for its military operations and rocket launches into Israel.Some Republicans also oppose linking U.S. war aid to Israel with continued war support for Ukraine. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nPersian Morteza Jabalameli asks for peace during a pro-Palestinian march calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, Saturday, Oct. 21,2023, downtown Los Angeles.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nFlares fired by Israeli forces light up the night sky in Gaza City, Monday, Nov. 6, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Andy Harris pushes GOP bill to expel, block Palestinians from U.S. amid Israel-Hamas War\n\n November 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 2 | Section: News \n \n 928\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A group of conservative Republicans - including U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland - have introduced a bill to expel Palestinians from the U.S. if they entered the country on or after Oct. 1.The Safeguarding Americans from Extremism (SAFE) Act also puts a hard stop on all visas, refugee and asylum requests from individuals holding Palestinian Authority passports.The bill is in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks in the Israel and the resulting Holy Land war in Gaza and cites worries about Islamic terrorists and extremists entering the U.S. It is sponsored by by U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Montana, Cosponsors include Harris and U.S. Reps. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia.\"This legislation keeps America safe. I don't trust the Biden Administration any more than I do the Palestinian Authority to screen who is allowed to come into the United States,\" Zinke said in a statement. \"This is the most anti-Hamas immigration legislation I have seen and it's well deserved. Given the circumstances, the threats to our immigration system and the history of terrorists abusing refugee, asylum and visa processes all over the world, the requirements in this bill are necessary to keep Americans safe. This bill does exactly that.\"Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks inside Israel killed 1,400 people (including civilians and close to 450 children). Israel Defense Forces have responded with a siege of Hamas-controlled Gaza, a sustained bombing campaign and ground invasion.Palestinian authorities under Hamas' control in Gaza say the death toll there exceeds 10,000 people including more than 4,100 children. U.S. and Israeli officials have cast some doubts on the Palestinian figures pointing to Hamas' control of health agencies and information flows.According to Harris and Zinke, the bill would \"render Palestinian Authority passport holders (covered inadmissible to the U.S\". revoke visas to Palestinians issued on or after Oct. 1 and prevents the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from granting current or future visa, asylum and refugees requests from Palestinians.Last month, U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Montana, introduced a bill to block the Biden administration from allowing Palestinian refugees into the U.S.Conservative Republicans have also resisted some proposed U.S. humanitarian aid outlays for Gaza, especially fuel, contending it will end up being stolen and used by Hamas in its war against Israel.Zinke, Daines and other conservatives have also voiced concerns about Hamas, Hezbollah and other Islamic terrorists entering the U.S. via the Mexico border for potential terrorist attacks. Zinke cites a U.S Customs & Border Protection alert from the agency's San Diego alerting personnel to potential crossing by \"foreign fighters' related to the Hamas war with Israel.Democrats as well as Palestinian and Muslim advocates oppose Zinke's legislation.\"Today, extreme MAGA Republican Ryan Zinke introduced a bill to Palestinians from entering the U.S. and possibly even expel those already here. This is the textbook definition of racism,\" said U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California. Lee is a progressive, anti-war Democrat who has called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.Zinke served as U.S. Secretary of the Interior in the Trump administration. Former President Donald Trump also pushed for a U.S travel ban from certain Muslim and other countries with ties to terrorism during his term in office.Both Palestinian territories - the West Bank and Gaza - are overwhelmingly Muslim and are home to anti-Israeli, anti-American Islamic militant and terrorist groups (including Hamas and Islamic Jihad).But there are also between 1,000 and 1,300 Christians in Gaza and 50,000 Christians in the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to the U.S. State Department and other estimates.The Biden administration has supported Israel after the Hamas terrorist attacks dispatching two aircraft carrier groups, fighter jet squadrons and troops to the Holy Land war zone. The Democratic administration has also pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for pauses to conflict to allow for humanitarian supplies and releases fo some of the more than 220 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza after the attacks inside Israel.The Biden administration has launched new federal efforts to combat Islamophobia even as antisemitic threats and vandalism rise. The move comes as substantial numbers ofyoung voters and progressives oppose and criticize Biden's support for Israel and fault Netanyahu's war against Hamas.\"Israel's indiscriminate bombing is hitting hospitals, refugee camps, and killing thousands of innocent people. It must stop now,\" said U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont.Netanyahu and Republicans have opposed prolonged pauses and ceasefires in the war arguing they will help Hamas. The IDF has also pushed back on increasing criticism internationally and U.S. progressives over the civilian casualties in Gaza saying Hamas purposefully locates its rocket and missile launch locations and terrorists operations near schools, playgrounds, mosques, hospitals and churches.Israel has agreed to four-hour daily pauses to allow for civilian movements away from battle zones. Netanyahu said the pauses are not ceasefire.U.S. Sen Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said told CNN Nov. as much as 80% of the population in Gaza supports Hamas and its bid to destroy Israel and much of the Palestinian population there is radicalized.Harris - who represents Maryland's Eastern Shore - said in a statement the focus should be on defeating Hamas \"We have to support Israel 100%. Hamas started this war. Hamas is a group of radical Islamic terrorists. They must be defeated otherwise they are a threat to the entire world,\" Harris said. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a press conference with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz in the Kirya military base in Tel Aviv, Israel, Saturday, Oct. 28, 2023.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nA man waves a Palestinian flag as protestors cross the Brooklyn Bridge during a demonstration demanding a cease-fire on Saturday, Oct. 28, 2023, in New York. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "White House Christmas ornament honors Gerald Ford\n\n November 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Destiny Herbers; Capital News Service | Page: 2A | Section: News \n \n 635\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The White House Historical Association unveiled earlier this month its Official 2023 White House Christmas Ornament honoring the 38th president of the United States, Gerald R. Ford.Each year for President's Day, the association releases a custom ornament honoring a former president. A team of up to 20 people work on planning and designing the American-made ornaments throughout the year.\"The ornaments serve as a wonderful teaching tool designed to tell the story of the White House during a specific presidency or anniversary,\" said Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association. \"Through these collectibles, we've been able to further our mission to protect, preserve, and provide public access to the rich history of America's Executive Mansion.\" The 2023 ornament, a three-dimensional wreath, features symbols on the front inspired by the First Lady Betty Ford's White House decorations that could be recreated on Christmas trees at home, Matthew Costello, senior historian at the White House Historical Association, said.\"One thing that Betty Ford did, and it was reflective of the times, was this old-fashioned, handcrafted Christmas,\" Costello said.\"This was a feature amongst their Christmas decorations every year that they were at the White House.\" The front of the wreath is adorned with tiny decorations including dolls, doves, stars, candles, and gingerbread men, as well as red ribbons with \"Christmas 2023\" and \"The White House.\" On the back of the ornament are a series of emblems relating to the life and presidency of Ford and a gold plaque featuring the North Portico of the White House.A member of the U.S.House of Representatives since 1949, Ford was nominated as vice president by Richard Nixon in 1973 after the resignation of the previous vice president, Spiro Agnew. Ford assumed the presidency just 10 months later when Nixon resigned over the Watergate scandal.Ford was the only president to have never been elected to the office of vice president or president.Ford is also the only president to become an Eagle Scout, the highest achievable rank in the Boy Scouts of America, an accomplishment that is referenced in the \"Troop 15\" emblem on the White House ornament.\"Gerald Ford was either one of our most, or our most, athletic presidents,\" Costello said. \"He played collegiate football at University of Michigan and was offered contracts to play professionally but he decided not to and went to law school instead, which was probably a good decision.\" A football with Ford's jersey number 48 is featured at the top of the ornament's wreath alongside a line portrait of Liberty, the Ford family's famous golden retriever, who had a litter of puppies in the White House.The ornament also features a bicentennial pin, commemorating the Ford family's celebration of the 200-year anniversary of America's founding, and an emblem for the U.S.S. Gerald R Ford, a firstin-class aircraft carrier commissioned to honor the president's service in the Navy.\"All of these different element emblems tell us a part of the story of who Gerald Ford was and you know, what he did earlier in his life, and what took place when he was president of the United States,\" Costello said.Proceeds from the ornaments fund the White House Historical Association's educational work, Costello said, including a teacher institute and resources, public programming, a web series called \"White House History Live,\" and research initiatives.The association is a private, nonprofit organization founded in 1961 by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.The popular Christmas ornaments date to 1981. That first ornament depicted a flying angel. The next year, the ornament honored George Washington; subsequent ornaments have honored each president in order. \n \n Caption: Gerald R.

    "content": "Election takeaway: abortion remains a potent issue for voters\n\n November 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bridget Byrne; Capital News Service | Page: 13 | Section: News \n \n 858\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Tuesday's elections brought multiple victories for reproductive rights advocates, a strong sign that abortion access will be a durable issue and a motivating factor for many voters in 2024.\"In case it wasn't already blindingly obvious before, the abortion issue in a post-Dobbs political environment continues to be a significant advantage for Democrats,\" Kyle Kondik and J. Miles Coleman wrote Wednesday in Sabato's Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan website at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.Ohio passed a ballot measure enshrining reproductive rights in the state constitution, and Democrats in Virginia retained control in the state Senate and flipped party control of the House of Delegates.In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear won re-election after making support of abortion rights a key message of his campaign.And in Pennsylvania, Dan McCaffery, a Democrat who campaigned on abortion rights won a seat on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.At the center of all these races was the Supreme Court's decision last year in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, in which a majority of justices ruled that the Constitution does not guarantee a right to an abortion. The ruling effectively overturned the landmark 1973 decision in Roe v.Wade in which the right to an abortion was protected.\"Abortion access is still a salient message a year and a half after the Dobbs decision, and demonstrating that while voters may be dissatisfied with the direction of the country and its Democratic leader, they're still hesitant to put Republicans in charge instead,\" said Jacob Rubashkin, an analyst with Inside Elections.Polling shows Americans largely support access to abortion.A Gallup poll in July found only 13% of Americans thought abortion should be illegal in all circumstances; 69% said abortion should be legal in the first trimester, although support dropped to 37% for the second trimester and 22% for the third.\"Abortion access isn't just a winning issue with voters; it's a fundamental right that impacts every aspect of their lives,\" Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom For All, said in a statement.\"Ohioans have now constitutionally guaranteed this right, and the nation is watching.\" Ohioans voted in favor of Issue 1, a ballot measure that would change the Ohio Constitution to include protection for abortion access.The amendment states that \"every individual has a right to make and carry out one's own reproductive decisions.\" It also states that \"the State shall not, directly or indirectly, burden, penalize, prohibit, interfere with, or discriminate\" against those seeking abortions or those performing them. Abortions may be prohibited once a fetal is viable, generally considered between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy.Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a Republican, said on X that his party needed to evaluate how its candidates will argue against reproductive rights in 2024.\"We need to understand why we lost this battle so we can win the war,\" Vance said in an X post. \"We have to recognize how much voters mistrust us on this issue.We've fallen behind on the moral argument. I'm talking about sustained, years-long efforts to show the heart of the pro life movement.\" In an appearance Wednesday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Ohio's other senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, praised the grassroots efforts to pass Issue 1 in his state.\"People understand that a national abortion ban takes their rights away, maybe forever, and that's why people worked so hard last night,\" Brown said.Brown has held his seat since 2007 and is up for reelection next year. He said the vote on Tuesday proves that abortion will be a critical issue in the race.\"The three Republicans running in the primary next year to be the nominee against me, all three of them have called for a national abortion ban. So they are so out of step with Ohio voters,\" Brown said.Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, said before balloting Tuesday that if the GOP won the majority in both houses of the state legislature, the state would \"lead\" by enacting a 15-week ban, with exceptions. The current law bans abortion after 26 weeks.\"I think this is what Virginians expect. I think they know that in a state that is so purple, that we do debate.We do argue,\" Youngkin told reporters Wednesday. \"But they expect us to find common ground on these most important topics and to press forward.\" In Wednesday's Republican presidential debate, the candidates - all opposed to abortion - disagreed on the path forward for the GOP in handling the issue.Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, who is from Ohio, said he was upset about the votes on Tuesday and said the Republican Party was a \"party of losers.\" Florida Gov. Ron Desantis said Tuesday's results caught the party \"flatfooted.\" Former New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie said abortion rights should be decided state by state and argued that the bigger issue is that \"we're not pro-life for the whole life,\" advocating for funding drug addiction rehabilitation.South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott was not ready to concede any ground, criticizing states that have passed legislation affirming abortion rights and calling for a nation-wide 15-week limit to stop \"reckless behavior\" in states that have affirmed abortion rights, such as Kansas, California, New York, and now Ohio.Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley said she would support any abortion ban that can get the votes to pass. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In response, Virginia officials, along with FBI director Christopher Wray, called for a reversal of the decision, with Wray claiming in a letter to the agency last month that the GSA failed to address conflicts of interest in the selection process.Gov. Wes Moore, along with U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer, U.S. Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, all Democrats, as well as other Maryland leaders, celebrated the decision Friday, while criticizing the statements made by Wray.Cardin threw back some of the claims, calling out Wray for his actions.\"We saw the hand ofthe director ofthe FBI trying to change what should be a fair, competitive, open process to steer it to Virginia,\" said Cardin. \"The GSA has released all of the information on how they made the decision. Transparency, it's there. Take a look at it-it's not a close call.\"Finding the FBI a new headquarters has been an ongoing issue for more than decade. Hoyer described how former FBI Director Robert Mueller came to him in 2009, describing the need for a new building and how the current headquarters is crumbling.Van Hollen defended Nina Albert, the commissioner of GSA's Public Buildings Service, who has been named in published reports as the official who Wray claimed had a conflict of interest. Albert previously worked for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which owns the land where the new FBI headquarters will be located.\"It is absolutely wrong ofdirector Chris Wray to impugn and question the character, the integrity and the independence of the site selection administrator,\" said Van Hollen. \"She's an expert in the field ofreal estate and transit, she's a public servant and she had a distinguished career as an Army veteran. \"Virginia leadership, including U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, and Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, responded to the relocation decision, echoing some ofthe issues brought up by Wray.\"We are deeply disturbed to learn that a political appointee at the General Services Administration overruled the unanimous recommendation of a three-person panel comprised of career experts from the GSA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluding that Springfield, Virginia, is the site best suited for the new FBI headquarters. We have repeatedly condemned political interference in the independent, agency-run, site selection process for a new FBI headquarters. Any fair weighing ofthe criteria points to a selection of Virginia. It is clear that this process has been irrevocably undermined and tainted, and this decision must now be reversed.\"GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan responded to Wray, calling the claims ofinterfer-ence \"unfounded\" in a statement released Thursday.\"At every step, the GSA team has worked to incorporate the FBI's feedback and appropriately address their concerns, including conducting a legal review ofeach concern raised.\"The new facility will sit on an undeveloped 61-acre plot, directly across from the Greenbelt Metro Station. It is expected to be significantly cheaper than the Springfield site, the officials have said. Proximity to NASA, the University of Maryland, College Park and the NSA factored into the final decision.At Friday's news conference, Maryland leadership expressed repeatedly that they are confident that the decision is final.To illustrate why he is confident the process will proceed, Hoyer brought up Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz's attempt to restrict funding for the FBI's new headquarters which \"lost overwhelmingly\" in a vote on Wednesday. Van Hollen echoed this sentiment \"I am confident that we will work with our colleagues to get it done because, as you heard in the House the other day, an effort to, I think, essentially claw back a lot of the monies that have already been there, lost,\" said Van Hollen. \n \n Caption: CAPITAL NEWS SERVICE/TOMMY TUCKER\n \nU.S. Sen.

There are often scores of tourists, Christian pilgrimages and Christmas events.But the war has greatly diminished tourism, restricted travel and closed businesses. There has also been skirmishes and violence in the West Bank as the war rages in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks inside Israel killed more than 1.400 people.Christmas, as it is traditionally celebrated in the West Bank, is essentially being canceled in Bethlehem in response to the war.\"Bethlehem Municipality crews announced the dismantling of Christmas decorations installed several years ago in the city's neighborhoods and removing all festive appearances in honor of the martyrs and in solidarity with our people in Gaza,\" the West Bank local government said More than 11,000 Gazans have been killed in succeeding Holy Land war with dire conditions reported by relief agencies.Hamas is also holding 240 Israelis including some children hostage inside Gaza after the Oct 7 attacks. That includes several Americans with dual Israeli citizenship.There are an estimated 50,000 Christians in the West Bank and Jerusalem and 1,000 to 1,300 in Gaza.Both Palestinian areas are overwhelmingly Muslim.There are another 185,000 Christians living in the Jewish state of Israel The Church of the Nativity is operated by a consortium of Holy Land churches.The church said the war, its impacts and restrictions, including restrictons on businesses, travel and workers, are taking a toll.\"The lack of pilgrims, closed economic activities, difficulty traveling to work, make daily life and the possibility of having a dignified life difficult,\" the Catholic order of the Franciscans said in plea for help.A SOMBER CHRISTMAS The move comes after Christian churches in the Holy Land called for a somber and subdued Christmas season this year in the birthplace of Jesus Christ with the war between Israel and Hamas bring death and destruction to Gaza and the region.The Patriarch and Heads of the Churches of Jerusalem - who lead and represents Christian denominations in Israel, the Palestinian territories and other Holy Land countries - issued a joint statement calling for understated and retrospective Christmas observances this year because of the war.Christian communities in the Holy Land often celebrate Christmas with \"public festivities and the large-scale displays of brightly lit and expensive decorations as a mean of expressing our joy at the approach and arrival of the Feast of the Nativity,\" the patriarchs write in a statement.\"But these are not normal times, Since the start of the war, there have been an atmosphere of sadness and pain,\" the heads of the Roman Catholic, Episcopal-Anglican, Greek-Eastern Orthodox, Coptic, Syrian Catholic, Armenian Catholic and other Holy Land churches said.They are calling for toneddown yuletide season with a focus on praying for those suffering because of the war - which started after Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks in inside Israel.\"Thousands of innocent civilians, including woman and children, have died or suffered serious injuries.Many more grieve over the loss of their homes, their loved ones or the uncertain fate of those dear to them.Throughout the region, even more have lost their work and are suffering serious economic challenges.Yet, despite our repeated calls for humane ceasefires and de-escalation of violence, the war continues,\" the Jerusalem patriarchs write in a joint statement.STANDING WITH ISRAELBefore the Oct. 7 bloodshed in Israel and ensuing bloodshed in Gaza, there were sectarian tensions in Jerusalem and other parts of the Holy Land.In early October (before the Hamas attacks), Pope Francis and Orthodox Christian leaders condemned Orthodox Jewish men spitting at Christian pilgrims in Jerusalem. There has also been harassment and vandalism of Christians in Jerusalem and West Bank.Christian pilgrimages to the Holy Land date back to Byzantine and Crusader times and have continued into contemporary times. They have a $3 billion regional economic and tourism impact, according to a 2021 study by the University of Birmingham.Islamic militants - including Hamas - have also used ultra-Orthodox Jewish incursions near and at the al-Aqsa Mosque as of one of the drivers of the Oct. 7 attacks. The mosque, where Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended into heaven, is on the site of the Temple Mount, a Jewish holy site.More than 1,400 Orthodox Jews visited the Temple Mount site Oct. 3 during the Sukkot holiday upsetting Muslims and drawing a promised response from Hamas. Four days later the Islamic terror groups launched its surprise attack.Israel enjoys strong war support from some Evangelical leaders. That includes John Hagee, a prominent Evangelical pastor and chairman of Christians United for Israel who helped organize the March for Israel in Washington.Hagee said many of the Christians at the pro-Israel were not alive during the Holocaust. \"But we are here now and we stand shoulder to shoulder with the Jewish people. We stand until those 240 hostages are returned to their homes,\" said Hagee who backs Israel's war efforts.'STOP THE KILLING'Pope Francis, the World Council of Churches and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby have been part of the calls for a ceasefire, de-escalation of violence and release of hostages.Michael Curry, presiding bishop for the Episcopal Church in the U.S. wants President Joe Biden to press the Israel to relent in their invasion and attacks in Gaza.\"U.S. leadership must tell Israel to stop bombing civilian areas and allow access for full humanitarian aid to flow freely into Gaza. Every human child of God-Palestinian and Israeli-deserves safety and security. We need to stop the killing. Today,\" Curry said in statement Nov. 7. \"Vengeance will not bring back the dead. Retaliation will not repair the harms and the hurt. We are called to love, even and especially when it seems impossible.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed to humanitarian pauses in the fighting but not a general ceasefire as Israel Defense Forces look to root out Hamas installations and fighters via ground and air attacks.Netanyahu also said Israel security forces will remain in Gaza after the war.\"In order to ensure that there is no such threat, the IDF will continue to have security control over the Gaza Strip for as long as necessary to prevent terrorism from it,\" Netanyahu said.The Holy Land church leaders said in their joint statement Nov. 10 they want the bloodshed and war to end and Christians celebrating Christians to focus on the spiritual side of Christmas and \"to stand strong with those facing such afflictions this year by foregoing unnecessarily festive activities.\" \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nPalestinian scouts march in the Christian Orthodox Christmas Eve celebrations at the Church of the Nativity in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, the traditional birthplace of Jesus, Friday, Jan. 6, 2023.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nA woman lights candles inside the Church of the Nativity, traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Jesus Christ, in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, Saturday, Dec. 24, 2022. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dangerous minds - Israel-Hamas war, Musk comments, police surveillance spark new social media fights\n\n November 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; Apg National Enterprise Editor | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1895\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Holy Land war between Israel and Hamas is birthing increased police and government surveillance of social media, prompting calls for more Americans to report \"hate crimes\" and proposals to require all social media accounts to have public name verifications amid concerns about increases in antisemitism and terrorism threats.There are also pushes to deport some anti-war, pro-Palestinian foreign college students deemed supportive of U.S. designated terror groups and expel and ban Palestinian refugees from entering the country.The efforts are born out of security concerns stemming from U.S. support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza after the Oct. 7 terror attacks. But they are also sparking concerns about stunting or intimating dissent, privacy and other free speech protections.There is also a new social media battle over Twitter/X owner Elon Musk's support for a social media post that talked about anti-white sentiments among \"Jewish communities.\" A number of major media and technology advertisers, who also compete with social media platforms and some of Musk's technology ventures, have paused advertising on X. That includes Disney (which owns ABC and ESPN), Apple, Paramount Global (which owns CBS and Comedy, IBM, Comcast/NBC Universal (which owns NBC and MSNBC) and Warner Bros/Discovery (which owns CNN).Musk said he agreed with a post from a Twitter who said \"Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.\" \"You said the actual truth,\" Musk said in a reply Nov. 15, latter adding that his concurrence was geared toward progressive activist groups and the Anti-Defamation League.The Biden administration condemned Musk's statement Friday. \"We condemn this abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms,\" the U.S. administration said in statement drawing parallels to the beliefs of the Robert Bowers, who faces the death penalty after the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh left 11 congregants dead.The ADL on Nov. 16 also criticized Musk. \"it is indisputably dangerous to use one's influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories, said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblalt, who on Friday then praised Musk for his condemnation of pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas phrases 'from the river to the sea' and 'decolonization.' Musk said Saturday some of the critics are dangerously using the episode to squelch free speech and that. he plans on suing progressive activists he claims inaccurately showed neo-Nazi and antisemitic posts next to Twitter/X advertisers' promotions.\"I am sticking to my principles. As for any fake advocacy groups who seek to suppress free speech, they should remember that karma is real,\" Musk said on his social media platform.EXPELLING FOREIGN COLLEGE STUDENTSThere is a GOP push to expel foreign college students deemed to be supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and other groups on the U.S. government's list of terrorist groups.A group of 21 GOP attorneys general - including Ashley Moody of Florida and Austin Knudsen of Montana - want the federal government to \"vigorously renew vetting of foreign students' and deport those deemed to have endorsed or provided \"material support to foreign terrorist organizations.\" \"It is possible that renewed vetting of foreign students already admitted to the United States may reveal activity that renders them ineligible to hold a student visa and liable to deportation,\" Knudsen, Moody and their cohorts wrote in a letter Nov. 8 to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the U.S.Department of Education.Free speech and civil liberties advocates say the reactions to anti-Israel war protests (some of which have seen antisemitic rhetoric) can bleed into censorship as well as quieting and punishing voices of dissent.\"Free speech means protecting speech you don't like. Sometimes it even means protecting speech you find abhorrent and hateful,\" said U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, after voting against censure measure aimed at U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, over her anti-Israel rhetoric and use of a pro-Hamas slogan.BANNING PALESTINIAN REFUGEESA group of congressional Republicans - including U.S. Reps. Andy Thomas, who represents the Eastern Shore, along with U.S. Reps. Ryan Zinke of Montana and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and U.S. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, are also leading efforts to keep Palestinian refugees from the war out of the U.S. Zinke, Harris and Greene also wants to kick out Palestinians who entered the country on or after Oct. 1 in the aftermath of the Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks inside Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.They say said he does not trust the Biden administration or Palestinian authorities to adequately screen potential refugees.Critics say the proposal is xenophobic.Similar sentiments related to refugees and college students have been echoed by 2024 GOP presidential candidates such as former president Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has suspended pro-Palestinian students' groups in his home state deemed extremist and favored restrictions on public library and school curricula content deemed inappropriate or offensive.While conservatives press universities, who have sometimes aggressively banned right-wing voices from their campuses, to condemn and crackdown on pro-Palestinian student protesters, the American Civil Liberties Union wants them to uphold free speech principles.\"It is precisely in times of heightened crisis and fear that university leaders must remain steadfast in their commitment to free speech, open debate, and peaceful dissent on campus.These principles are the bedrock of academic freedom at all universities,\" the ACLU said in a statement.\"The First Amendment protects all people who live in this country, whether they're here as citizens, foreign nationals, or visitors,\" the civil liberties group said.ENCOURAGING MORE HATE CRIME REPORTINGDaines and a bipartisan senators including U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, have also recently written to FBI Director Christopher Wray and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security asking for more investigative and enforcement resources to be dedicated to addressing antisemitism.The Anti-Defamation League reports a 300% increase in anti-Jewish threats, vandalism and violence since the start of the war, which has seen more than 1,400 Israelis and more than 11,000 Gazans killed.In a separate letter, U.S. Sen Jon Tester, D-Montana, also said FBI and DHS efforts should also be focused on white supremacists echoing past and current Biden administration efforts to go after alt-right groups.The Biden White House, which has put a focus on going after right-wing groups since taking office in 2021, has also launched a new task force to go after \"Islamophobia\" during the war.On Tuesday, the FBI said it added Oregon to a nationwide effort aimed at encouraging getting more Americans to report \"hate incidents' ' with billboards posted in Eugene, Medford and Corvallis as well as digital signs at Portland International Airport.Similar hate crime billboards have been put up across the country, including last month in North Carolina, along with ads on public transit systems, social media platforms and local media outlets.Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI released new data showing there was a 7.3% increase in reported hate crimes in 2022 (11,634 cases versus 10,840) in 2021.There were more than 6,500 racially motivated incidents - 52% of them aimed at Blacks - and more than 2,000 cases related to religion - with 55% targeting Jews, according to DOJ.SOCIAL MEDIA SURVEILLANCE, FORCED VERIFICATIONSA state law in Montana backed by Knudsen and GOP Gov.Greg Gianforte banning Chinese-owned social media app TikTok is also one of the central fronts in efforts to restrict social media platforms and content.Montana lawmakers worry about TikTok's data security and ties to the Chinese government.The ban is being mirrored in other states.The Montana prohibition is being challenged by TikTok and free speech advocates in court.But there are also other efforts to increase government regulations and scrutiny and law enforcement surveillance of social media.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Nov. 13 that state police have ramped up social media surveillance and will reach out more to individuals and groups posting hate speech online.\"We're very focused on the data we're collecting from surveillance efforts. What's being said on social media platforms.And we have launched an effort to be able to counter some of the negativity. and reach out to people when we see hate speech being spoken about on online platforms,\" Hochul said. \"Our media analysis, our social media analysis unit, has ramped up its monitoring of sites to catch incitement to violence; direct threats to others.\" The New York governor said the rise in extremist and violent threats after the start of the war in the Middle East \"poses a clear and present danger.\" But the idea of more aggressive police surveillance of social media posts raises some concerns.Gerard Kassar, chairman of the New York Conservative Party, said police social media monitoring is potentially \"chilling to the core\".\"Law enforcement authorities can and should monitor legitimate terrorism suspects online, but spying on everyday citizens is unconstitutional and wrong,\" Kassar said.Republican presidential candidate and former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley wants to require all social media accounts be verified by name thus eliminating anonymous online speech on major platforms.\"Every person on social media should be verified by their name,\" said Haley, who is increasingly being promoted as an establishment and neoconservative 2024 alternative to former president Donald Trump.\"First of all, it's a national security threat. When you do that, all of a sudden people have to stand by what they say. And it gets rid of the Russian bots, the Iranian bots and the Chinese bots. And then you're going to get some civility when people know their name is next to what they say, and they know their pastor and their family members are going to see it,\" Haley told Fox News.Haley also backs a TikTok ban pointing to the recent viral traffic of a letter criticizing Israel and the U.S. from Osama Bin Laden.Harris told Fox News Nov. 16 that Congress could soon take some actions related to TikTok and the issue will come down to speech versus national security, citing the platform's Chinese ownership.The verification push sparked a backlash from free speech advocates, particularly on the right who have already been upset over social media bans and content restrictions over coronavirus vaccines and challenges to the 2020 election results.They say it will eliminate anonymous dissent and speech.\"Nikki Haley is 'openly' pushing for the government to use private tech companies to censor speech. This is a flagrant violation of the Constitution and straight out of the Democrats' playbook.Any politician who thinks it's OK for the government to use the private sector as its censorship bureau shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the White House,\" said Vivek Ramaswamy, who has frequently sparred with Haley over TikTok and other issues. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nTwitter/X, Tesla and SpaceX's CEO Elon Musk gestures during an in-conversation event with Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in London, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2023.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nRepublican presidential candidates former U.N.

Martin O'Malley to be the next commissioner of the Social Security Administration.All 14 Democrats and three Republicans - Sens.Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Thom Tillis North Carolina - supported advancing O'Malley's nomination.Ten other Republicans voted against O'Malley.\"Gov. O'Malley will demand that there be better customer service at the Social Security Administration,\" Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, told his colleagues before the finance panel's vote. \"We need someone responsible to report to us as to why it takes so long for our constituents to get the services they need from the Social Security Administration.Gov. O'Malley will take that responsibility as the accountable person.\"O'Malley was nominated by President Joe Biden in July to head Social Security after removing Andrew Saul, a holdover from the Trump administration. Saul's term as commissioner proved controversial for his connection to a conservative think tank, the Manhattan Institute, that calls for cuts to Social Security. Biden's action drew the ire of Republicans.\"When the Biden administration removed the last Senate-confirmed commissioner prior to the completion of his six-year term, I expressed strong concerns that this decision politicized the SSA to the detriment of Social Security beneficiaries,\" said Idaho Sen.Mike Crapo, the finance committee's top Republican.\"I will not be supporting his (O'Malley's) nomination today.\"Crapo noted that Saul did not have sufficient time to implement any reforms before he was removed and that the Biden administration now had set a precedent to shorten the Social Security commissioner's term, and that future administrations could do the same.The committee's chairman, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, rejected Crapo's concerns, saying \"the Supreme Court ruled that single agency heads serve at the pleasure of the president There is the authority of the president to replace an individual.\"O'Malley's nomination now awaits a confirmation vote by the full Senate. If confirmed, O'Malley would head the federal agency for a term ending in January 2025.The Social Security Administration had a budget of $1,3 trillion in fiscal 2022 and had about 60,000 employees. The agency handled benefits for some 70 million people in 2021. \n \n Caption: Sen.

Mark Warner of Virginia.\"We applaud the inspector general for moving quickly and encourage him to move forward to complete a careful and thorough review,\" Virginia's delegation said in a joint statement.The agency said it welcomes the review and pointed out that it had already released decision-making materials and a legal review of concerns raised by the director of the FBI.\"We carefully followed the requirements and process, and stand behind GSA's final site selection decision,\" an agency spokesperson said in a statement.The review comes after FBI Director Christopher Wray told staff in an internal message earlier this month that he was concerned about a \"potential conflict of interest\" in a GSA executive choosing a site owned by a previous employer.Wray said his objections were about the process rather than the site itself.GSA, which manages the government's real estate portfolio, denied any conflict.The agency said the site about 13 miles northeast of Washington was the cheapest one with the best access to public transit.Maryland and Virginia have long been vying to land the FBI's heasquarters.Maryland's leaders applauded the Greenbelt choice, saying was \"never about politics\" and the new facility would meet a \"dire, longstanding need.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Progressive feminists of the world: where are you?' - Mayim Bialik, others criticize progressives, UN, women's groups for muted responses to Hamas' Oct. 7 rapes, violence against women\n\n December 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; Apg Newspapers | Page: A2 | Section: News \n \n 990\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Progressives, women's groups and the United Nations are facing criticism for their silence or reticence to denounce or condemn Hamas for rapes, torture and other violence toward women and girls during and after the Oct. 7 terror attacks inside Israel.Actress Mayim Bialik, former Facebook/Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg and Israeli First Lady Michal Herzog have been pushing for women's and feminist groups to step forward to condemn Hamas' violence which sparked the Holy Land war.More than 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 hostages were taken into Gaza Oct. 7. There were also rapes, sexual assaults and the killing of women (including some who were pregnant) as well as children (and unborn children), according to Israeli authorities.'ABHORRENT & CONSPICUOUS ABSENCE'\"Progressive feminists of the world: where are you?,\" Bialik wrote in a post on social media platform X.\"There has been an abhorrent and conspicuous absence of women's organizations around the world unequivocally condemning the systematic rape and torture of women on October 7 by Hamas. Brutal gang rapes, sexual torture, and murder of foetuses happened-period.Where are the \"BELIEVE THEM\" voices? These crimes against women were in many cases documented by the terrorists themselves and broadcast for the world to see. Those of us who have fought for women's rights and have sought to shout from the rooftops when women's bodies are being used in war for the sadistic pleasure of perpetrators are astounded at how the world has been silent surrounding this\" Bialik wrote. \"The UN (U.N. Women - the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women) took 50 days to express \"alarm.\" The actress is a co-host of the \"Jeopardy\" game show and is best known for her roles on American television shows \"Big Bang Theory\" and \"Blossom\".Herzog also wrote in a Newsweek piece that she was disappointed by international women's groups relative silence towards Hamas' violence towards women and girls, including rapes and sexual assaults. She referenced the killing of a pregnant Israeli woman and removal of her unborn baby shown in a jarring Hamas video.'TOO LITTLE TOO LATE'UN Women - an arm of the United Nations focused on women's and gender matters - issued a statement Friday, Dec. 1. condemning the Oct. 7 attacks. This came after officials from the group were unwilling to condemn the attacks.\"We deeply regret that military operations have resumed in Gaza, and we reiterate that all women, Israeli women, Palestinian women, as all others, are entitled to a life lived in safety and free from violence.We unequivocally condemn the brutal attacks by Hamas on Israel on 7 October. We are alarmed by the numerous accounts of gender-based atrocities and sexual violence during those attacks. This is why we have called for all accounts of gender-based violence to be duly investigated and prosecuted, with the rights of the victim at the core,\" the statement reads.The UN Women's group's statement was met by criticism from Israeli officials and backers.\"This statement is shameful and morally distorted just like the organization who issued it. UN Women - do you really think you can get off the hook so easily after having kept silent for more than 50 days?! You have betrayed the Israeli girls and women victims of terrible sex crimes perpetrated by Hamas,\" said Emmanuel Nahshon, deputy director general for diplomacy for the Israeli Foreign Ministry.Patricia Heaton, an actress who backs Israel in the war, also faulted the UN statement as tardy.\"Too little too late,\" Heaton said.'THIS IS A WAR ON CHILDREN'The United Nations, other international groups and U.S. progressives have been critical of Israel's air strikes and ground invasion of Gaza after the Hamas attacks. Palestinian authorities have said more than 14,800 Gazans have died in war.A number of activists and progressives - including on college campuses and within political groups - have strongly criticized Israel and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the war. They point the number of women and children being killed in the Gaza war.\"We cannot see more children with the wounds of war, with the burns, with the shrapnel littering their body, with the broken bones. Inaction by those with influence is allowing the killing of children.This is a war on children,\" said UNICEF spokesman James Elder.A top official with the Roman Catholic Church's Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said late last month that 21 Christians have been killed in the Gaza war so far.That includes an 80-yearold woman who was shot in the leg and bled to death in the street. The church group said the Christian woman's body laid in the street for three days.'I BELIEVE WOMEN - DO YOU?'But some UN and politically progressive groups have been reticent or in some case muted when it comes to criticizing Palestinian side and Hamas, Herzog and Bialik and other supporters of Israel note.\"When people march and assert RESISTANCE BY ALL MEANS NECESSARY, this is what they are supporting: gang rape, mutilation of women's bodies, and torturing foetuses.I can't believe I have to say this again: Rape is never an act of resistance. Cutting off body parts is not an act of resistance. This is what happened on October 7. I believe women and I believe the footage Hamas has broadcast showing sexual crimes against women. Do you?,\" Bialik posted on X.U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, also voiced frustration that civil rights and other Democratic groups for not condemning the Oct. 7 attacks.U.S. President Joe Biden has seen his approval ratings sink with progressives and younger voters over his support Israel in the Holy Land war.The Biden administration brokered a temporary ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel and has pushed Netanyahu to extend that ceasefire and take less strident tactics against Hamas in Gaza.That ceasefire ended Friday, Dec. 1. \n \n Caption: JORDAN STRA USS/AP PHOTO\n \nMayim Bialik arrives at the 27th annual Critics Choice Awards on Sunday, March 13, 2022, at the Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hamas claimed responsibility for the Jerusalem attack.\"With one hand, Hamas signs a ceasefire, and with the other, it sends terrorists to murder Jews in Jerusalem.This is not a ceasefire, but the continuation of the concept of inclusion and surrender.We must cease the deals with the devil, and immediately return to fighting with tremendous intensity in order to achieve the supreme goal of the war: the complete destruction of Hamas, with all its metastases and affiliates,\" Ben Gvir said in statement Thursday.Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, also called for Netanyahu to resist pressure from the U.S and its Middle Eastern mediators in Egypt, and Qatar to extend the war's stoppages.\"Not on the agenda, not even as a suggestion. There is no discussion about it at all. This is a plan to eliminate the State of Israel. We continue until the absolute victory with God's help and the destruction of the Nazis of Hamas,\" Smotrich said on X.He also said the Jerusalem terrorism shows a wider Holy Land conflict.\"We are at war on all fronts. The terrible attack in Jerusalem reminds us that our enemies are not only the Nazis in Gaza. We will pursue and destroy them with God's help everywhere,\" Smotrich said.'NOTHING WILL STOP US' Netanyahu promised that Israel's war will not relent in a speech Wednesday and then again Thursday after gunman killed three people and injured others at bus stop in Jerusalem. Israeli security forces killed the gunman and Netanyahu blames Hamas.\"I have just concluded a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, shortly after Hamas murderers murdered people here in Jerusalem. I told him that it is the same Hamas,\" Netanyahu said in a video posted social media platform X on Thursday \"It is the same Hamas that perpetrated the terrible massacre on October 7th and the same Hamas that is trying to murder us everywhere. I told him: We have sworn, I have sworn, to eliminate Hamas.Nothing will stop us.\" On Friday, Blinken and White House officials blamed Hamas for the end of the ceasefire and restart of the war.The Israeli prime minister's vows to continue to war welcomed by Ben Gvir.\"Just to be clear: we must return and fight with all our strength until the absolute decision,\" he said The IDF and Hamas restarted the war Friday.The ceasefire has seen more than 100 hostages (all women and children) released by Hamas-including two with dual American-Israeli citizenship was well as some from Thailand and the Philippines, according to tallies from the White Huse, BBC and other groups. In exchange, the Israelis have released 240 Palestinian prisoners (all women and teens) from jails, according to various media tallies.There are still an estimated seven Americans (with dual Israeli citizenship) among those still held captive by Hamas inside Gaza. The U.S. brokered ceasefire deal calls for three Palestinian prisoners to be released for every one hostage.Palestinian authorities in Hamas-controlled Gaza say more than 14,800 people have died since the war started after the war after the Oct. 7 attacks. The United Nations and other relief groups have warned of already dire situations for women and children in Gaza getting even worse.Biden wants Israel to scale back its attacks on Hamas in southern Gaza if and when the war starts. Progressives in the U.S. as well as a sea of international interests are also faulting Israel Defense Forces for civilian casualties in the Holy Land war.That includes Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez who supports broader European recognition of a Palestinian state and said Israel is violating humanitarian law in the war.That prompted Netanyahu to recall Israel's ambassador in Madrid and to call in Spain's ambassador in Jerusalem. \n \n Caption: MOHAMMED HAJJAR/AP PHOTO\n \nA Palestinian man sits in an armchair outside a destroyed building in Gaza City on Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2023, the sixth day of the temporary cease-fire between Hamas and Israel. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Another 50,000 Christians live in West Bank and Jerusalem and 185,000 Christians live in Israel making up smaller percentages of the total population of the Holy Land.\nMore than 20 Christians have died in Gaza, according to estimates from the Roman Catholic Church's Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem.\nChristmas celebrations have been canceled in Bethlehem because of the war, many businesses are closed and Holy Land tourism (a $3 billion industry) has significantly slowed because of the war. Holiday decorations have been taken down.\nMunther hopes the Jesus in the rubble stirs thoughts and prayers regarding Christmas and the Middle East war.\n\"I realize this is a difficult idea,\" he said. \"But believe me, this is precisely the meaning of Christmas this year as death, destruction and rubble in our land. This is how we welcome 'the King of Glory'. If Jesus was to be born into our world today, I wonder would he have entered our world in any other way?\nChristmas is the presence of baby Jesus with those who suffer. Christmas is God's solidarity with the oppressed. Christmas is a ray of light and home from the heart of pain and suffering. Christmas is the radiance of life from the heart of destruction and death. In Gaza, God is under the rubble. He is in the operating room,\" the Lutheran pastor said.\n\"Christmas celebrations are canceled this year but Christmas itself and is not and will not be canceled for our hope cannot be canceled.\nJesus birth is our hope. Jesus is our hope, \" the Palestinian church pastor said.\n\"The child of Bethlehem is our hope,\" he said in another post Christian churches in the Holy Land - which include Lutheran, Catholic, Anglican and Orthodox denominations - have called for subdued and Christmas observances and have pressed for a ceasefire in the war.\nIn the U.S., Evangelical Christian churches have been some of the strongest supporters of Israel - backing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bid to dismantle Hamas after the Islamic militant group's Oct. 7 attacks.\n\"In keeping with Christian Just War tradition, we also affirm the legitimacy of Israel's right to respond against those who have initiated these attacks as Romans 13 grants governments the power to bear the sword against those who commit such evil acts against innocent life,\" the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, a public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention said in a statement shortly after the Hamas attacks.\nThat statement has been signed by more then 2,000 Baptist and Evangelical pastors and other U.S.\nChristians.\nOn Nov. 25, another set of Evangelical evangelists, pastor and political advocates wrote congressional leaders voicing support for U.S. backing of Israel's war against the Hamas.\nThe letter calls for the U.S. to \"support Israel's efforts to degrade and destroythe Islamic terrorist organizations Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza; help Israel defend its civilian population with more IronDome protection; press for economic and diplomatic normalization between Israel and regional Arab nations.\" It was led by the Faith and Freedom Coalition and was signed by the group's chairman, Ralph Reed, as well as some prominent Evangelical pastors including John Hagee (who is also chairman of Christians United for Israel), James Dobson, Jentezen Franklin and Gordon Robertson (chair of the Christian Broadcasting Network).\nAmerican Evangelicals have often sided biblical instructions to stand with Israel and point to 'End-Time' prophecies of Jesus' Second Coming.\nMunther wants Evangelicals to focus more on the carnage, suffering and casualties of war and the Christian commandment to 'Love your neigbhor as yourself ' rather than 'End Times' prophecies. \n \n Caption: TWITTER/MUNTHER ISAAC\n\n A Lutheran church in Bethlehem has a Christmas Nativity centered on the war and suffering in Gaza.\n\n TWITTER/MUNTHER ISAAC\n\n The war-focused Nativity is at the Christmas Lutheran Church in Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The resolution's most controversial component was plank equating anti-Zionism with antisemitism.\nZionism is a movement and belief system that supports the Jewish state of Israel in the Middle East.\n\"Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel,\" according to the Anti-Defamation League.\nThirteen Democrats voted against the measure and 105 Dems voted 'present' or did not vote neither supporting nor opposing the resolution.\nOne Republican - U.S.\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky - voted against the anti-Zionism/antisemitism measure. Another four GOP lawmakers did not vote.\n\"Anti-Zionism isn't antisemitism,\" Massie said in a social media statement pointing to congressional remarks by U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, that some Orthodox and other Jews are not in agreement with modern Zionist constructs.\nNadler, the House's most senior Jewish members, said some Orthodox Jews believe only the Messiah can establish a new state of Israel and the measure can label progressive Jews and others critical of controversial judicial reforms in Israel as antisemitic.\nNadler and U.S. House Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, were among those voting present on antisemitism measure.\nThe 13 Democratic no votes came from progressives who have been critical of Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas and U.S. support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the Islamic militant group's Oct. 7 attacks.\nOpponents of the measure - which referenced rises antisemitic vandalism and violence - included U.S. Reps. Jamaal Bowman and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Pramila Jayapal of Washington \"We must be steadfast and clear in condemning antisemitism. The extreme GOP resolution on the floor today had no Democratic cosponsors and inappropriately said all anti-Zionism is antisemitism. Muddying the waters about what antisemitism is, is completely wrong and unhelpful,\" said Jayapal who had to clarify recent comments about whether she condemned Hamas' rapes and violence against women and girls in the Oct. 7.\nGOP SUPPORTS MEASURE U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican representing the Eastern Shore, voted for the antisemitism measure along with Maryland Democratic U.S. Reps.\nSteny Hoyer, David Trone, Dutch Ruppersberger and Kweisi Mfume. Maryland Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin and John Sarbanes voted present.\nHouse Republicans overwhelmingly backed the resolution which labels some pro-Palestinian slogans as antisemitic.\n\"More Jews were murdered on October 7th than on any other single day since the Holocaust.\nLet that sink in. We have even seen members of this very body repeat blatantly antisemitic rhetoric and spread lies about Israel and her right to exist. Let me be absolutely clear: such hate has no place in the halls of Congress nor our national discourse. It is our fundamental responsibility as leaders and Members of Congress to condemn and fight these horrific acts of hate and discrimination against the Jewish community,\" said U.S. Rep. David Kustoff, R-Tennessee, one of the main sponsors of the resolution.\nGOP backers of the measure point to a rise in antisemitic incidents and pro-Hamas and pro-Palestinian rhetoric that calls for or insinuates the destruction of Israel. They also point to the 106 no or present that did not support the measure - 105 of them from Democrat.\n\"The world has seen a drastic rise of antisemitism since October 7th that is deeply disheartening and extremely concerning,\" said U.S. Max Miller, R-Ohio. \"Elected leaders must have the courage to condemn and fight all forms of domestic and global antisemitism.\nWhile I am glad this resolution passed the House today, I am disappointed that 106 of my colleagues failed to take this opportunity to condemn antisemitism forcefully.\" AMERICA DIVIDED The Gallup poll released Nov. 30 shows significant splits over the Holy Land war by race, political party and gender.\nThe polls shows 71% of Republicans back Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza versus support from 36% of Democrats.\nFifty nine percent of men approve of Israel's war in Gaza versus 44% of women, according the Gallup Among people of color, 64% disapprove of Israel's attacks against Hamas in Gaza while 61% of whites backs Netanyahu's efforts to dismantle the militant group.\nThere is a similar split my age with 67% of younger Americans (ages 18 to 34) disapproving of Israel's war against Hamas and 63% of voters 55 and older backing the Israel Defense Forces' military effort.\nPalestinian health authorities in Hamas-controlled Gaza say more than 17,000 people have died since Holy Land war stared in October Israeli officials say Hamas fighters killed more than 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages in the Oct. 7 terror attacks. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n Noa Mittelman, 15, center, and Maya Talby, 15, right, hold up flyers of people kidnapped by Hamas during a rally and march for Israel, Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023, in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, Wash.\n\n ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n Muslim protesters burn U.S. and Israel national flags during a rally against the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2023.\n\n ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n A demonstrator waves a Palestinian flag as Kenyan police officers fire teargas canisters during a protest against Israel and in support of Palestinians, in Nairobi, Kenya Nov. 9, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Record U.S. defense money for AI, quantum weapons, Israel, Ukraine - $886 billion military spending bill keeps FISA surveillance, approves $600M for Kyiv, R&D, weapons for IDF\n\n December 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Page: 2 | Section: News \n \n 1266\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The deep partisan divides in Washington do not extend to U.S. military spending - which is approaching $1 trillion annually.Congress approved the $886 billion National Defense Authorization Act this week with bipartisan support from both U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.\nThe record-high, U.S. military spending bill includes weapons and outlays for Israel (including joint development or artificial intelligence and quantum technology weapons) and Ukraine and extends a controversial government surveillance program.\nThe measure approves $600 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine in its war against invading Russia forces. The U.S. has already provided $44.2 billion in weapons and other aid to Ukraine since Russia 2022 invasion and President Joe Biden wants to provide $61 billion more as part of a $106 billion war package that also includes outlays for Israel, border security and Taiwan.\nThe bipartisan legislature also bolsters U.S. support for the Israel as it continues its war against Hamas in Gaza after the Oct. 7 attacks by the Islamic militant group. More than 18,000 Gazans and 1,200 Israels have died in the Holy Land war.\nThe U.S. measure has $500 million for Israel missile defense systems including the Iron Dome which is used to repeal rockets from Hamas, Islamic and Hizbollah. The package - which will soon be signed by Biden - also allocates $47.5 million for new U.S and Israeli joint military research related to artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum technologies.\nIt also extends the Pentagon's ability to ship \"precision-guided munitions\" and other weapons systems to Israel as well as a joint anti-tunneling program.\nIsrael Defense Forces are in the midst of a ground invasion of Gaza including efforts to root out and destroy Hamas tunneling system below the densely populated Palestinian area.\nThe NDAA also instructs the Pentagon and federal agencies to implement a \"national strategy\" to combat antisemitism.\nAIPAC - a pro-Israel lobbying group - and the Anti-Defamation League - leading Jewish group - both back the defense measure.\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minnesota, said the NDAA \"includes numerous provisions to expand U.S.-Israel defense cooperation and one to ensure that no military resources go to anyone participating in anti-Israel boycotts.\"\nIsrael already receives more than $3 billion U.S. defense aid annually.\nThe NDAA also includes a 5.2% pay increase for U.S. military personnel, funds National Guard deployments aimed cross-border drug trafficking in particular fentanyl and approves more than $16 billion to bolster the U.S. military's posture in the Pacific Rim and help allies such as Taiwan and the Philippines which have faced saber rattling from China.\nBIPARTISAN BACKING\nThe House approved the U.S. military spending package by a 310 to 118 vote Thursday.\nRepublicans voted for the measure by a 147 to 75 margin. Among Democrats, 163 House members supported the defending spending program while 45 opposed.\n\"I was proud to support the NDAA, which include a historic pay raise for our troops, additional tools to disrupt fentanyl trafficking and critical support for Israel,\" said U.S. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a freshman Republican from Oregon.\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, all backed the Pentagon measure.\nThe Senate approved the measure Wednesday by an 87-13 vote.\nSchumer hailed the bill as helping the Pentagon develop and deploy more AI systems and weapons.\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said the measure reinforces U.S. backing for Israel, Ukraine and NATO and will propel next generation weapons.\n\"By harnessing the power of America's science and technology, the NDAA will invest in disruptive technologies like hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing while continuing to modernize our ships, aircraft, and ground combat vehicles,\" Cardin said in a statement.\nINDUSTRY BACKING\nLobbying groups and associations representing the aerospace, technology and defense contracting sectors back the bill including increase U.S. Defense Department spending on AI and quantum computing.\n\"The U.S. must be the global leader in the investment, development, and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) to ensure it is implemented responsibly across the world. This year's NDAA includes provisions that will strengthen our leadership in AI and other emerging technologies, including quantum computing,\" said TechNet, a group whose members include Apple, Deloitte, Amazon, Google and Meta, in a statement supporting the NDAA.\nThe Aerospace Industries Association, whose members include Honeywell Aerospace, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, RTX (Raytheon), BAE Systems and Boeing, also supports the big defense spending and more money for AI.\nBiden is expected to sign the bill which was approved shortly after a visit to Washington and Capitol Hill by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which included meetings with lawmakers and defense contractors.\nBiden warned U.S. support for Ukraine could run out if the $106 billion war supplemental is not approved. White House officials said that could embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin and results on direct conflicts between Moscow and NATO involving U.S. troops.\nThe no votes in the Senate came from six Democrats (including Oregon Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley), six Republicans (including U.S. Sens. J.D Vance of Ohio, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah). U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, also oppose the measure\nFISA FIGHT\nSome NDAA opponents were upset with a provision in the 3,000-page bill that reauthorized Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\nAn effort to block that reauthorization failed in the U.S. Senate.\nCritics of the FISA section (including the American Civil Liberties Union), which is focused on investigating foreign terrorists, say it allows the FBI and intelligence agencies to spy on Americans without a court-approved warrant.\nU.S. Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Montana, said he's backed past defense spending measure but voted no Thursday on the latest NDAA over the FISA surveillance issue and concerns over taxpayer money being used to pay for abortions and gender reassignment surgeries and to allow drag queen shows on military bases. The final bill did not include GOP language specifically restricting Pentagon on those social issues.\n\"A vote in favor of this bill is a vote to allow the U.S. government to spy on you.\nA vote in favor of this bill is a vote to allow the U.S. military to pick you up and lock you up in Guantanamo Bay without representation. A vote in favor of this bill is a vote to inflict the radical left's social experiment on our military and is an insult to our men and women in uniform, which is why I voted no,\" Rosendale said.\nRosendale also said the FBI used FISA Section 702 to spy on \"U.S. citizens more than 278,000 times without a warrant.\"\nU.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican representing the Eastern Shore, and Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Montgomery County, voted against the defense bill. The rest of Maryland's delegation - all Democrats - voted for the spending measure.\nU.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said measure will bring $886 million to Fort Meade which is home to the National Security Agency for renovations and expansion of NSA operations.\nSome of the Democratic opposition came from progressives who have been critical of U.S. and Biden administration support for Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks.\nDemocratic no votes includes ones from U.S.\nReps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Pramila Jayapal of Washington.\nWhile GOP leadership backed the measure along with former House Speakers Kevin McCarthy, R-California and Nancy Pelosi, D-California, some notable populist conservatives joined progressive \"Squad\" member in opposing the defense budget.\nGOP U.S. Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Matt Gaetz, Anna Paulina Luna and Greg Steube of Florida, and Doug LaMalfa, of California, voted against the NDAA. \n \n Caption: President Joe Biden meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2023, in Washington. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dec. 7, for the 14th consecutive year, they were again hosted by Kent Island American Legion Post 278, in Stevensville, under direction of Past Post Commander and the 2023 Maryland State Legionnaire of the Year Nikki Randolph.\nRandolph has earned a reputation for her passionate care for all veterans, making sure veteran grave sites are bestowed with American flags and Christmas wreaths at appropriate times of the year, every year.\nThe yearly tradition began when she was then commander of Post 278 and contacted Morrill and Karen Worcester of Maine, who had already begun the Wreaths Across America program - hauling Christmas wreaths from their state to the nation's capitol to place those wreaths on all veteran's grave sites at Arlington National Cemetery.\nRandolph and Legion 278 volunteers provided three meals, dinner, breakfast and boxed lunches to the convoy before they made the final leg of their journey to Arlington.\nThis year, the Wreaths Across America sent out over 3,000,000 Christmas wreaths across the nation to more than 4,200 locations to be placed on those grave sites. Most were placed on Saturday, Dec. 9.\nEleven wreaths were also presented to families connected to Post 278, whose veterans chose to be cremated rather than buried in a cemetery.\nOne of those was to the wife of the late George Dashiell, who served during World War II in Germany.\nMrs. Wally Dashiell, now 100-years-old has been a widow for the past 17 years. She said, \"I'm truly grateful that the Legion honored George in this way.\" The wreath was placed next to the urn that holds his ashes, the American flag presented during his memorial service, and a picture of George.\nFriday morning the convoy departed from Legion 278 along Route 8, children from both Matapeake Elementary and Middle Schools cheering and waving small American flags. An emotional scene, it was clear the children were excited to participate.\nSaturday at noon, American Legion Jeff Davis Post 18 in Centreville, hosted their annual Wreaths Across America ceremony at Chesterfield Cemetery. Approximately 200 people were present, many of them children and teens with their parents. \n \n Caption: PHOTOS BY DOUG BISHOP\n\n U.S. Army veteran John Nizer is pictured laying a Christmas wreath for all POWs and Missing in Action veterans at the annual Wreaths Across American ceremony at Chesterfield Cemetery in Centreville, Saturday afternoon, Dec. 9.

    "author": "TIMOTHY HOLDINESS",
    "content": "Finding a political identity in a red state\n\n January 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TIMOTHY HOLDINESS | Section: Columns \n \n 526\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Born into a Republican family in Louisiana, a state increasingly painted in shades of red, I grew up amid conservative dialogues with honest values. My childhood was steeped in Republican ideologies, shaping my early political outlook. However, as I matured, my views began to diverge from my family's, leading me on a journey through America's polarized political landscape.My first significant political shift occurred during my college years. Drawn to Bernie Sanders' progressive policies and candid demeanor, I found myself aligning more with the Democratic Party. Sanders' message of social justice and economic equality resonated with me, contrasting sharply with the conservative values I was raised on. This shift was not just ideological but deeply personal, reflecting a desire for a more equitable society.\nHowever, disillusionment soon set in. As the Democratic Party nominated a candidate I couldn't wholeheartedly support in the 2016 election, I switched my registration to the Green Party and voted for Jill Stein in protest. This decision, born out of frustration with the party's direction, was my way of asserting a political identity independent of the mainstream options.\nYet, this stance was short-lived. Recognizing the practical limitations of third-party voting in our binary political system, I returned to the Democratic fold. But this reunion was not a homecoming; it was a strategic choice, a compromise of sorts.\nToday, I stand as an independent, disenchanted with the binary party system that seems more focused on partisan rivalry than on addressing the real issues facing our nation. As a Louisianian, this stance is particularly challenging. Louisiana's political landscape has become overwhelmingly Republican, often leaving little room for alternative viewpoints. This environment has sharpened my understanding of political diversity and the importance of open, respectful discourse.\nLiving in Louisiana has offered unique insights into the Republican psyche. It has helped me understand the concerns and motivations the GOP, even as I disagree with some of their policies, I can't help but agree with others. This understanding is crucial in a state like ours, where political discussions can quickly become divisive, it's important to be able to see from all points of view and vote for action over ideas.\nThe journey from a Republican upbringing to a Democratic supporter, then to a protest voter, and finally to an independent, mirrors a broader disillusionment with party politics in America. It reflects a yearning for a political system that transcends binary choices and embraces a more nuanced, inclusive approach to governance, as many other nations on Earth.\nAs a nation, we face a critical question: How do we foster a political environment where diverse viewpoints are not just tolerated but valued? My journey suggests the answer lies in embracing our political diversity, engaging in open dialogue and prioritizing issues over party allegiance.\nMy political evolution is not just a personal narrative; it's a reflection of a growing segment of Americans disenchanted with the two-party system. As a Louisianian, I've witnessed firsthand the limitations of this system. Perhaps it's time for our state, and our country, to embrace a new political paradigm — one that truly represents the diverse voices of its people.\nTimothy Holdiness is a community Rreporter for The Daily News in Washington Parish, Louisiana. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There has also been social media footage of Ecuadorian troops and police officers cracking down on gang members.\nNoboa, who was born in Miami and educated in the U.S., said the South American country is in a \"state of war.\"\nU.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller condemned \"violence and terrorism at the hands of narco-criminal elements\" in Ecuador and promised to increase intelligence sharing and other resources with the government.\n\"To accelerate that cooperation, senior U.S. officials will visit Ecuador in the coming weeks to explore with Ecuadorian counterparts ways we can work together more effectively to confront the threat posed by transnational criminal organizations. These officials include Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Assistant Secretary Todd Robinson, Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs Deputy Assistant Secretary Kevin Sullivan, Commander of U.S. Southern Command General Laura Richardson,' Miller said.\n\"U.S. law enforcement officials will also travel to assist Ecuador in criminal investigations. In addition, the United States will increase intelligence sharing, cooperation to combat malicious cyber activity, and assistance with the implementation of prison reforms and will employ other available tools to hold accountable those individuals and organizations engaging in criminal activity and undermining the rule of law,\" the statement continued.\nU.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland (who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) echoed American backing for the Ecuadorian government in the strife which also included a prison escape of a top gang leader.\n\"Ecuador is a key partner of the United States. Its security and prosperity are in the mutual interest of our peoples. We are horrified by the heinous acts of violence perpetrated by armed criminal groups across the country. We reaffirm our support for President Noboa as he moves to restore order and bring justice to those undermining the country's stability,\" said Cardin in a joint statement with House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas.\nNoboa talked about the U.S. military deal on the Canela radio station.\n\"We will receive help from the United States. The swap will involve outdated Russian and Ukrainian scrap for modern equipment and technology worth $200 million,\" Noboa told the station.\nLast year, Richardson said the U.S. was asking Latin American countries to swap out older Russian and even Soviet-era weaponry for new American systems and munitions and ship that older equipment to Kyiv in the fight against Russia.\n\"We are working with the countries that have the Russian equipment to either donate it or switch it out for United States equipment,\" Richardson said during an appearance at the Atlantic Council in Washington, according to Voice of America and other outlets.\nThe U.S. has sent more than $44.9 billion weapons and other military aid to Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the Eastern European country in February 2022.\nBut a new $61 billion aid package for Ukraine that is part of a larger proposal that includes $14 billion for Israel's war in Gaza and $14 billion to bolster border security has been stalled in Congress as Republicans press for more stringent immigration reforms and some press against more spending on the European war. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'This is our mandate': What's driving Evangelical Christians steadfast support for Israel and the war against Hamas in Gaza\n\n January 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Newspapers | Section: World \n \n 1939\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Shawn York said he felt \"a commission\" to support Israel and to \"do something\" after Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks that sparked the war in Gaza.York is lead pastor at Highpoint Church in Gulf Breeze, Florida. The 1,100-member Evangelical church is located near Pensacola.\nYork partnered with local Jewish rabbis and hosted \"A Night to Honor Israel\" event in December to show solidarity after the Hamas attacks that killed more than 1,200 people Oct. 7 and to condemn antisemitism.\nThe Evangelical pastor said the event came together after meeting with a local rabbi whose synagogue had been vandalized after the Oct. 7 attacks sparked Israel Defense Force airstrikes and a later ground invasion of Gaza aimed at dismantling Hamas.\n\"We had a cup of coffee and hit it off,\" said York, adding that the pro-Israel event was aimed at bringing the local religious community together. \"It was a very grassroots effort.\"\nAcross the U.S, Evangelical Christians have emerged as some of the strongest supporters of Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's war against Hamas and other Islamic militants.\nSome conservative Christians point to biblical instructions to support Israel and the Jewish people. Others also see events in the Holy Land as part of 'End Times' prophecies that result in establishment of a third Jewish temple in Jerusalem (where the Al-Asqa Mosque sits) and eventually the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.\nSix hundred people attended the Florida event in-person and another 1,400 have watched it online. York said it is in important to get supportive messages out about Israel pointing to a rise in antisemitism and vocal criticisms of the war and supportive U.S. policies on social media as well as from progressives and pro-Palestinian activists on college campuses.\n\"Israel's fight is a cyber war just as much as a ground war,\" the Florida pastor.\n'AMEN FOR THAT'\nYork said he and his wife had previously visited Israel and toured the Gaza border. He was at a conference hosted by Christians United for Israel in Texas in the midst of the Holy Land war.\nChristians United is a pro-Israel group formed by prominent pastor and television evangelist John Hagee. The group was one of the organizers of the March for Israel rally in November on the Washington Mall and has helped local churches put on their own events.\nThe San Antonio-based group did not respond to requests for an interview about their efforts.\nThe group's 2022 nonprofit tax form said its mission is to \"increase the knowledge of Christian Zionists in order to help them become more effective in defending Israel to the public and in Washington.\"\nThe \"Christian Zionist' group's goal is to train Evangelicals, including pastors, to become advocates for Israel and to lobby every member of Congress by dividing them into \"hundreds of 'teams'.\"\n\"CUFI Action Fund will instruct approximately 5,000 attendees at a Washington D.C. meeting on what it takes to effectively influence Congress,\" the tax filing reads.\nThe pro-Israel group also said in the filing that it would \"select over 300 attendees who possessed exceptional communication skills and have wide circles of influence in their communities to be Action Fund leaders.\"\nA number of churches have partnered with Christians United to host events supporting Israel since the war started.\nThat includes the Grand Island Baptist Church, which hosted a \"Stand with Israel\" event in December and had another update on the Middle East situation on Sunday, Jan. 14.\nGrand Island Baptist Pastor Freddy Young told his congregation that CUFI has 13 million members and is an important advocate for pro-Israel policies in the U.S.\n\"CUFI is the largest grassroots organization supporting Israel to be found anywhere in the world. Amen for that,\" Young said during the Dec. 4 event.\n\"When people in Washington D.C. do crazy things, we blow their computers ups. We can send them several thousand messages in almost the snap of a finger.\"\nHagee and CUFI are organizing an annual summit for pastors and other Christians supporters of Israel in Washington in late July.\n\"The people of Israel are fighting to protect their loved ones and their ancient homelands. We must stand by Israel,\" Hagee said in a social media post voicing biblical support for Israel, its right of self-defense and its battle with Hamas. \"Together, we can show the Jewish people that they are not alone.\"\nSome other Christian cable networks and television evangelists have also been supportive of Israel after the Oct. 7 attacks.\nJoni Lamb, co-founder and executive producer of the Daystar Television Network, told viewers that the Texas-based Christian cable channel had raised more than $6 million since the October attacks to support Israel including sending protective gear, mobile bomb shelters and provisions to communities impacted by the war.\nThe dynamic places Evangelicals not only among the strongest backers of Netanyahu but aligns one of former president Donald Trump's most solid constituencies with U.S. President Joe Biden who has vowed steadfast support for Israel and also calls himself a Zionist, advocating for Jewish homeland and nation-state in the Middle East.\nNetanyahu has invoked biblical passages during the war including a reference to Amalek and Amalekites — an Old Testament foe of the Israelites. Israeli officials say they have killed approximately 8,500 Hamas and other Islamic militants fighter in Gaza in addition to the 1,000 fighters killed during the Oct. 7 attacks inside Israel that also included more than 240 hostages being taken into the Palestinian territory.\n'WE CANNOT LET THIS SLIP AWAY'\nOther Evangelical Christians say their cause is two-fold — to support Israel's war against Hamas and to combat a rise in antisemitism that has manifested since the bombings and ground invasion.\nAntisemitic incidents are up 360% since the Hamas attacks and ensuing war compared to a year ago, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\"The American Jewish community is facing a threat level that's now unprecedented in modern history,\" said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. \"It's shocking that we've recorded more antisemitic acts in three months than we usually would in an entire year.\"\nADL reports 3,238 incidents between Oct. 7 and Jan. 7, including anti-Israel, anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish rhetoric at pro-Palestinian and anti-war rallies on U.S. college campuses, That compares to 712 antisemitic incidents a year ago.\nThe rise in antisemitism — along with supporting Israel after the Hamas terror attacks — are calls to action for many American Evangelicals..\n\"We cannot let this slip away and not be noticed by the world or understood,\" said Tiz Huch, who is part of a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Christian ministry with her husband Larry Huch.\n\"And this is our mandate — is to tell the world. The battle (between) light and darkness is real. And we all have to step up and do our part and be a voice for goodness and for God in the world today,\" said Tiz Huch during a broadcast and social media post Thursday, Jan. 11.\nThe Oklahoma-based ministry also sees End Times prophecies in the intersections of faiths in the Middle East.\n\"We will stand with Israel, repair the breach between Jews and Christians and fulfill biblical prophecy. This is how we prepare the world for the coming of the Messiah,\" Huch Ministries says on its website in a statement on support for Israel.\n'A USELESS SLAUGHTER'\nBut not all Christians are as steadfastly supportive of the Holy Land war and all its human costs.\nThere have been more than 24,000 deaths in Gaza since the war's start, according to Palestinian health authorities. Another 8,000 people are missing beneath the rubble. Most are presumed dead. More than 1.5 million people have been displaced and many of Gaza's homes and buildings have been destroyed since the war started in October.\nSave the Children International says approximately 10,000 children have died in Gaza since the war started. \"Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children,\" said United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres earlier this month.\nApproximately two dozen Christians have died in Gaza during the war. That includes those killed at St. Porphyrius Church in October and two women killed at the Holy Family Church campus in December.\nThe former was built in the 5th Century and the latter is the only Catholic parish in Gaza where there are only an estimated 1,000 Christians in an overwhelming Muslim area of 2.3 million people.\nThe Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem — which oversees Roman Catholic parishes in the Holy Land and Cyprus — blamed Israel Defense Forces for the killing of a woman and her adult daughter and the shelling of a convent building at the church compound. The IDF says it is not to blame for the church shootings or damage to the Catholic property.\nAn Israeli spokesperson said in a statement that it takes military actions against Hamas in civilian areas \"with the utmost seriousness — especially churches — considering that Christian communities are a minority group in the Middle East.\"\n\"The IDF only targets terrorists and terror infrastructure and does not target civilians, no matter their religion. The IDF takes vast measures to avoid harm to uninvolved civilians, while fighting against a terrorist organization which does everything to put civilians at risk — including by using civilians and holy sites as human shields for its terror activities,' the Israeli statement continued.\nPope Francis, the World Council of Churches and the heads of Anglican and Episcopal churches have called for ceasefires in the war.\n\"Civilian victims are not collateral damage. They are men and women with names and surnames who lose their lives. They are children who are orphaned and deprived of their future,\" Pope Francis said Jan. 10.\nCatholic officials previously condemned the shooting deaths and injuries at the Holy Family parish. The pope also called the war and its heavy humanitarian toll in Gaza a \"useless slaughter that offends the dignity of every person on earth.\"\n'THE DOWNTRODDEN AND THE OPPRESSED'\nHoly Land Christians — which include Armenian, Greek and other Orthodox denominations as well as Roman Catholics, Anglicans and Evangelical Lutherans — have criticized American Evangelicals and others supporting the war citing its humanitarian costs.\nIn an open letter to American and other Western Christians, a coalition of Holy Land Christians questioned support for the war and called for a focus on Jesus' message of peace and mercy.\n\"We reject all theologies and interpretations that legitimize the wars of the powerful. We strongly urge western Christians to come alongside us in this. We also remind ourselves and fellow Christians that God is the God of the downtrodden and the oppressed,\" the letter reads.\nThere are also an estimated 50,000 Christians living in Jerusalem and the West Bank (which has a population of 3 million) and 158,000 living in Israel (which has a population of 9.7 million)\nChristmas celebrations — including Bethlehem where Jesus was born — were subdued and decorations taken down because of the war in Gaza and conflicts in the West Bank and Lebanon where the IDF is exchanging fire with Hezbollah.\nIn the U.S., the Episcopal Church has called for the U.S. to tell Israel to stop the attacks in Gaza.\nJustin Amash, a former Michigan congressman and Palestinian-American Christian, points in a Substack article earlier this month that Gaza has been home to one of the longest standing Christian communities. Mary, Jesus and Joseph passed through the area in their biblical journeys to and from Egypt.\n\"A lot of people were surprised to learn there are Christians living in Gaza, but this community has existed since the earliest days of Christianity. Followers of Christ have long called Gaza home,\" said Amash who lost family members in the Orthodox church bombing.\n\"The people known today as Palestinian Christians are the descendants of Canaanites, Phoenicians, and Israelites who resided in the region that comprises present-day Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank. Palestinian Christians can trace much of their ancestry back to Jews and Samaritans who lived in the Levant thousands of years ago and became early Christians,\" Amash writes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The ballot process has begun, and it is mid-January.\nFunny how elections everywhere seemed to pretty much go off without much controversy for many decades. I'm sure someone will come up with a small incident and make it sound like something major but as usual, the hysterical comments will surely arrive.\nI just received in the mail, taxpayer paid, forms to apply for voter mail-in ballots for this years elections. You can opt to get mail-in ballots for future elections as well. Believe it or not you can also print these online yourself. Yes, print your own. What could possibly go wrong? Nothing, according to the Democrats and socialists who have pushed this agenda for years.\nOur government, our military, our schools and our banks have been hacked by people who have bad intentions or just the plain everyday criminals. But why worry about our votes? Sure voting may be difficult for a very small group of citizens and that has been and will always be the case.\nDoes anybody think that computer fraud is not an even greater risk to our democracy? Who started this ridiculous \"risk to our democracy\" campaign anyway? How cliche. It seems like only a select few believe that this new era of voting technology will go smoothly because that is what supports that group's agenda. Watch what accusations and problems are sure to happen during this election cycle.\nOur presidential elections are in the fall as usual and just about the time that our annual fall harvests conclude. Funny that it's about the same time the election ballot harvesting will begin. Maybe I'm the only one who thinks our election balloting process has gone down a dark road. I doubt that I'm alone.

    "content": "Steady leadership, respect earn voters' support\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 625\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As we proceed full speed into the 2024 presidential election, the levels of bitter, vitriolic, divisive, often misleading, bombastic and demeaning rhetoric from candidates of both parties continues to escalate.This election cycle reminds me of a bitter and contentious general election for governor in Pennsylvania.\nIn that election, the Republican candidate was William Scranton, a former one-term Republican member of Congress. The Democratic candidate was Richardson Dilworth, the incumbent mayor of Philadelphia.\nScranton's political resume was thin. His only experience as a candidate was his successful run for Congress. Despite that, the state GOP was bullish on him after losing to Democratic candidates in two previous gubernatorial elections. They believed Scranton's success as a volunteer civic leader on economic development issues in a depressed region of a rust belt state would resonate well with voters.\nDilworth on the other hand, had a long history of political success in Philadelphia. He was elected city treasurer, district attorney and twice as mayor. His success was due in part to Philadelphia being a deep blue city with huge numbers of Democratic votes cast in local and statewide elections.\nDilworth's electoral success in Philadelphia was also based in part on a simple, but effective campaign strategy. His campaign would purchase time on a local TV station to which he would invite his opponents to a debate. He did so fully expecting his opponents would not participate. They always obliged him. As a result, he had a full hour of viewers to himself, where he reminded them not only of his accomplishments, but also repeatedly mentioned that his opponent chose not to participate in the debate.\nAs the November gubernatorial election heated up, Dilworth again rented TV time and invited Scranton to join him for a debate. He smugly assumed that Scranton, like all his previous opponents, would be a no show.\nDilworth assumed wrong.\nMinutes before airtime Scranton unexpectedly strolled into the TV studio. A surprised and angry Dilworth had a meltdown. It started when Dilworth shouted at Scranton, \"What are you doing here?\"\nDuring the debate, Dilworth peppered Scranton with insults. With thinly disguised contempt he called Scranton a phony, a coward, a Little Lord Fauntleroy, and an Ivy League Dick Nixon. Unruffled, Scranton calmly but forcefully responded with \"You, sir, are a desperate man.\"\nAll of this was captured on film and was also widely reported by the print media who were there for the debate. Even those who did not see the actual television debate read all about Dilworth's meltdown.\nThe debate was an unexpected and game changing negative branding movement for Dilworth's grace under pressure, civility and steady leadership credentials.\nBy contrast, the debate was an unexpected and game changing positive branding moment for Scranton's grace under pressure, civility and leadership credentials.\nIn November, Scranton beat Dilworth with 55% of the total statewide votes. This occurred despite strong support for Dilworth from President Kennedy who had carried Pennsylvania in the preceding statewide presidential election.\nThis is a lesson for the candidates the Republican Party and the Democratic Party eventually nominate for president in 2024.\nAmerican voters have long deserved and rarely seen a presidential election where candidates are not demonizing those who disagree with them and their supporters, by questioning their motives and their intellectual capability to make informed decisions.\nRegularly showing grace under pressure, civility, steady leadership and respect for all views during a long and often grueling campaign is the best way for candidates to earn voter's support and gain their trust to govern fairly and inclusively if elected.\nNow is the time for presidential candidates from both parties to commit to disagree on issues without being extremely disagreeable. Voters deserve nothing less.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who serves as a trusted adviser on strategy, advocacy and media matters.

    "content": "Moral sanity arises from both sides of war\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ROBERT C. KOEHLER | Section: Columns \n \n 887\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n \"I am begging the world: stop all the wars, stop killing people, stop killing babies. War is not the answer ... War is not how you fix things. This country, Israel, is going through horror. And I know the mothers in Gaza are going through horror ...\"I can only kneel in awe.\nYes, there is sanity in the world — moral sanity — even, and especially, now, as revenge rages in Israel, fed by American armaments. There are courageous voices calling not simply for \"peace,\" essentially understood by much of the world as nothing more than a ceasefire, but for, oh my God, compassion, healing, love.\nThe \"enemy\" is as human as we are. And waging war against the enemy guarantees nothing but ... endless war.\nThe words above are those of Michal Haley, whose beloved son was murdered by Hamas, crying out in a Facebook video: \"In my name, I want no vengeance.\"\nPerhaps what matters most here is that she is not alone. Many courageous people across the planet are speaking out against the current war — the current genocide — from their wounded souls, demanding that the human race transcend its commitment to violence, dominance and revenge, which do nothing but perpetuate the carnage. War equals suicide.\nIt's also seductive and lucrative and built into the planet's geopolitical infrastructure. It's so simple: good vs. evil. It makes a great narrative, which much of the media surrenders to. Transcending the mindset of war requires facing life at a far deeper level of complexity, beginning, perhaps, with the understanding that all of humanity and all of life are connected. Most people know this, but the dark psychology of dehumanization — \"othering,\" creating an enemy to blame for our troubles — retains a prominent place in the collective mind.\nTranscending this may be the biggest challenge we face. What's crucial to understand is that this challenge is underway. South Africa's charge before the International Court of Justice that Israel is committing genocide against Palestine is one example of this.\nAs Craig Mokhiber and Phyllis Bennis write: (The case) \"has opened a crack in a 75-year-old wall of impunity through which a light of hope has begun to shine. If global protests can seize the moment to turn that crack into a wider portal towards justice, we may just see the beginnings of real accountability for perpetrators, redress for victims, and attention to the long-neglected root causes of violence: settler-colonialism, occupation, inequality, and apartheid.\"\nBut South Africa's challenge is only part of the global outrage against Israel's war on Palestine — and the challenge amounts to more than simply a ceasefire. It is also a cry for transcendence. For instance:\n\"We condemn the recent attacks on Israeli and Palestinian civilians and mourn such harrowing loss of life. In our grief, we are horrified to see the fight against antisemitism weaponized as a pretext for war crimes with stated genocidal intent.\"\nThis is from an open letter to the world, signed by several thousand Jewish writers, artists and activists, declaring that condemnation of the slaughter of Palestinians is the opposite of antisemitism. The letter continues:\n\"We find this rhetorical tactic antithetical to Jewish values, which teach us to repair the world, question authority, and champion the oppressed over the oppressor. It is precisely because of the painful history of antisemitism and lessons of Jewish texts that we advocate for the dignity and sovereignty of the Palestinian people. We refuse the false choice between Jewish safety and Palestinian freedom; between Jewish identity and ending the oppression of Palestinians. In fact, we believe the rights of Jews and Palestinians go hand-in-hand. The safety of each people depends on the other's.\"\nOh my God, this is what matters: the cessation of the stripping of religion from its deepest values and turning it into a game of dominance. My religion's better than yours. We are at a stage of our existence where we must begin disarming our hatred and fear and facing the future with — you might say — empowered compassion. We must begin living our deepest values, not simply \"defending\" them. This is moral sanity.\nAnd the voices the people who are saying this with the most courageous clarity are the ones who have been wounded by, or who have lost loved ones to, the moral insanity that continues to cut swaths across our world.\nHere's another such voice, one of many quoted by Orly Noy in +972 Magazine. The words are those of Maoz Inon, whose parents were killed in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack: \"My parents were people of peace ... Revenge is not going to bring my parents back to life. It is not going to bring back other Israelis and Palestinians killed either. It is going to do the opposite ... We must break the cycle.\"\nYes, yes, yes.\nPlease, please, please.\nIt is time to break the cycle. I address the words to Joe Biden, along with everyone else. It's not sufficient to tell Israel to \"be careful\" when it uses our bombs, to try to avoid killing (too many) children.\nIt's time to break the cycle. That means living our values, not defying them. That means ceasing to wage war.\nRobert Koehler is a Chicago award-winning journalist and editor. He is the author of \"Courage Grows Strong at the Wound,\" and his newly released album of recorded poetry and art work, \"Soul Fragments.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I suggested it provides good advice for whomever the candidates will be for president in 2024.\nAt this point in the 2024 election cycle, I do not know who the candidates will be.\nI do know this.\nI am not an apologist for or zealous supporter of former President Donald Trump or any other Republican candidate.\nI am not an apologist for or zealous supporter of President Joe Biden or any other Democratic candidate.\nI am not an apologist for or zealous supporter of any third party or independent candidate.\nMy guiding principle in the political arena has always been never to support or vote for a candidate based solely on party affiliation. My support and votes are based solely on how closely a candidate's views on public policy issues align with my views on those issues.\nMy guiding principle when writing guest commentaries is acceptance of the thinking of Frank Luntz who said this about messages — \"It's not what you say or write. You can have the best message in the world, it's what people hear or read. The person on the receiving end will always understand it through the prism of their own emotions, preconceptions, prejudices and preexisting beliefs.\"\nPresently my views on the two most likely major party candidates for president in 2024 are perfectly captured in a recent commentary by syndicated columnist Cal Thomas titled The Evil of Two Lessers.\nIn it, Thomas includes the following thoughts:\n\"Some voters in recent elections have complained about being forced to choose between the lesser of two evils. In the 2024 election, it appears we are heading for a worse choice — the evil of two lessers.\"\nThomas writes, \"Donald Trump continues demeaning and defaming anyone who disagrees with him. He repeats unproven claims that the 2020 election was 'stolen.' A myriad of other inaccurate statements has apparently had a negative influence on President Biden who has joined him in the mud pit. In his recent speech near Valley Forge, America will become like Germany in the '30s. The very future of democracy is at stake, he [Biden] claimed.\"\nThomas goes on to write, \"This isn't Biden's first trip into the mud. During the 2012 presidential campaign Vice President Biden told a Black audience that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney \"would put you all back in chains.\"\nThomas ends his commentary about 2024 by asking the question: \"Where is this corrosive language getting us? Why can't we have a true debate over the best ways to fix our problems? Claiming your opponent would rule like a Nazi, or that the other is a crook, solves nothing.\"\nI agree.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who serves as a trusted adviser on strategy, advocacy and media matters.

The best reason is that it is your chance to decide on what future world you want to inhabit. Do you want a world of personal freedoms and rights or do you want the state and ultimately the president to be able to cancel these freedoms and rights?The freedom to vote without standing in line for hours. In Maryland we have the option of requesting a mail-in ballot for all future federal and state elections. If this is your preference, check your incoming mail or go to vote.md.gov/MDvotes24 and fill out the ballot request form soon. If you are not registered to vote in Talbot County contact talbot.elections@maryland.gov to register. Other Maryland counties each have a Board of Elections registering voters. With a valid Maryland driving license or state ID your signature on one of these documents along with a Social Security number can become your official on-line voter registration. This form is found at the MVA.The freedom for women to decide over their own health care and reproductive care. Ohio's voters just amended their state constitution to add the right to reproductive freedom with protections for health and safety of patients and providers. Kansas voters preceded Ohio with a similar change in their constitution. State legislatures in Maryland and New York are planning to codify the right to abortion by putting the issue before the voters in the November 2024 election. Nine other states, including Florida, are in the process of collecting enough signatures to put this issue on the ballot in 2024.The freedom to legally marry whomever you choose or to be whatever gender you choose to be. Right now, these are legal rights, but they can be changed, just as the Supreme Court overrode their nearly 50-year old decision in Roe v. Wade that guaranteed the right to an abortion, and left abortion rights to each state to decide.The right to live in a democracy with a constitution and laws that must be followed by all including the president and the Department of Justice. Threatening federal or state officials performing their jobs prevents a democracy from functioning and should be a federal crime.The right to bear arms but only with obligatory background checks and training, resulting in a license similar to a driver's license. All states should pass a red flag law to keep arms away from mentally disturbed people. And most importantly, all states (or the federal government) must renew the assault weapons ban. Those weapons were made to use in wars, not on our streets and in our schools. Bullets from assault weapons can damage a body to the point where the body is unrecognizable. Especially a child's body. Firearms have been the leading cause of death of children and young adults in the United States since 2020. There is no reason to accept this carnage.\nWhich federal and state candidates are you planning to vote for who would protect these freedoms and rights? It is up to you to inform yourself about the candidates. You can find out most of what you need to know on-line.\nThe forms for your option to vote by mail have already been sent out. It could not be easier than that to vote.\nLena Gill lives in Easton and is a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Society is broken ... not the Constitution\n\n January 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BRIAN GRIFFITHS | Section: Columns \n \n 735\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Every so often, the left starts to complain about the Constitution. Kinda like this recent piece in The Atlantic by Larry Schwartztol and Justin Florence:The American experiment with constitutional democracy is in grave peril. If Donald Trump becomes president again, fighting to preserve U.S. constitutional democracy through his second term will require the courage, commitment, and creativity of a broad prodemocracy coalition.\nBut the problem is not merely Trump. The U.S. Constitution itself contributes to the country's crisis. As David Frum observed in a recent issue of The Atlantic, \"If Trump is elected, it very likely won't be with a majority of the popular vote\" but rather because our system for selecting the president \"has privileged a strategically located minority, led by a lawbreaking president, over the democratic majority.\" America must fight the immediate threat, but it must also go beyond that and stop this problem at its core: addressing once and for all the aspects of the Constitution that enable an authoritarian leader to remain within striking distance of the presidency.\nI, of course, don't disagree with the premise that Trump threatens the American Order and American governance. Trump has openly stated his disdain for our Constitutional system and his wish to rule by decree while surrounded by sycophantic narcissists who will not give a rip about being restrained by Congress, by the Courts, or by the Rule of Law.\nBut that's not the Constitution's fault.\nThe arguments by Schwartztol and Florence center around two basic premises, both of which have been left-wing complaints for years:\nThe original Constitution was written when democracy meant something radically different than it does today. Over time, Americans have amended the Constitution to make it more democratic, but shortcomings remain. The most significant, in our view, are the hardwired constitutional structures that are inimical to any modern understanding of democracy: the Electoral College, which could put Trump in office without majority support for a second time, and the equal allocation of two seats in the Senate to each state (an arrangement that gives a Wyoming voter 70 times more senatorial clout than a Californian). Reforming those structures would get the country much closer to the one-person, one-vote democratic ideal.\nThose two \"hardwired constitutional structures that are inimical to any modern understanding of democracy\" are what make us so unique and are a symbol of American exceptionalism.\nThe thing that the left continues to try and ignore or flat out just doesn't understand is the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution:\nThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\nThe premise of the Republic is federalism. It is not democracy.\nEver notice that the unitary states like the U.K., France and Italy always have the most instability with their parliamentary systems?\nThere's a simple reason for that. In these countries, states and localities have practically no power that is not bequeathed to them by the states. Whereas in federal systems like ours, the 50 states retain the power to do things on their own.\nThat's the real reason the left hates the Electoral College so much and hates that each state has an equal number of senators. They hate the fact that not all decisions are made in Washington. They hate the concept of federalism itself.\nThey close their piece with this warning:\nIn the midst of an ongoing democratic crisis — where a leading presidential candidate speaks openly of acting as a \"dictator\" and exacting retribution against his political opponents — investing in long-term reform can seem like a fantasy. Failing to do so, however, carries its own risks. Without attending to the architecture of American democracy, the inherent weaknesses at its foundation may, in time, cause it to come tumbling down.\nBut Trump isn't the problem here. Neither is the Constitution. It's us, as a society. That America has become so polarized has led us to this. That Republicans became so fed up with losing that they would embrace anybody they thought they could win. That Republicans convinced themselves that their side was so feckless that they would embrace a left-wing, gun-grabbing, pro-abortion Hillary Clinton donor statist like Trump \"because he fights\".\nWorries about Constitutional governance should not be focused on fixing a document that works. They should be focused on fixing a society that is broken.\nBrian Griffiths is a lifelong Marylander and publisher of TheDuckpin.com.

    "content": "Trump is on a roll showing his true colors\n\n January 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SUSAN ESTRICH | Section: Columns \n \n 648\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Donald Trump is on a roll. No, I'm not talking about his victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, although of course he won them both. I say \"of course\" because he's a president running for his second term, and if you judge him like you would an incumbent — who you would expect to do better than 80% or more — the fact is that he underperformed, especially in New Hampshire.He may be on a roll to the nomination, but the roll I'm talking about has to do with showing his true colors, which will end in his defeat.\nThe man cannot control himself. Start with where he finds himself — in a courtroom, at the defense table, being chastised by a judge because he can't keep his mouth shut. It's becoming an all-too-familiar position for the former president, sure to be even more so in the months ahead. He can't stop muttering insults, notwithstanding the defense's objections that the jury could hear him. But that's not the only place he's shown his lack of control.\nLast week, at 2 a.m., he took to Truth Social to rant about his quest for absolute immunity. This was after his lawyer told a court that even if he ordered a team of Navy Seals to assassinate a political opponent, he could not be arrested or prosecuted until and unless the House impeached him and the Senate convicted him. Trump was even more blunt: The rant was that, as president, he was entitled to \"ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY\" even if he \"crossed the line.\" So much for the fundamental principle that, in a democracy, no one is above the law.\nOn Sunday night, he went off the rails in his campaign stump speech on the subject of absolute immunity, adding in references to pedophile priests and rogue cops, seeming to suggest that their existence somehow buttressed the case for him to be absolutely immune. How? Why? Slurring his words, and making no sense, he sounded like a befuddled would-be dictator with no morals at all.\nAnd then came Tuesday night. He took obvious pleasure in humiliating his former rivals, Vivek Ramaswamy and Tim Scott. He gave Ramaswamy exactly one minute to grovel (he actually took an additional 40 seconds) before mocking Scott for having announced his engagement to marry the day before, leading commentators to explain that his feigned surprise was in fact a reference to the rumors that Scott is gay.\nThat was nothing compared to the wrath he displayed for Nikki Haley, who he spent most of his speech attacking on the ground that \"I find in life you can't let people get away with bulls---.\" Scott, who was appointed to the Senate by Haley, clapped uncomfortably while Trump attacked her for everything from her clothes to her determination to stay in the race. To say that he didn't act like a winner, but a bitter old man, is an understatement. His former press secretary, appearing on Fox News, pointed out the obvious: that with seven out of 10 Haley voters saying they would not vote for Trump, it was time for the former president and presumptive nominee to reach out to unify the party rather than excoriate his opponent.\nJust before midnight on Truth Social, he reacted by calling them both names: \"I don't need any advice from RINO Kayleigh McEnany on Fox. Just had a GIANT VICTORY over a badly failing candidate, 'Birdbrain,' and she's telling me what I can do better.\"\nThen he returned to New York, bringing even more attention to the E. Jean Carroll trial, where he had already been found liable for sexual assault and defamation, and the only question was how much it would cost him. The day before, Trump had walked out of the courtroom muttering loudly, \"This is not America.\" The jury had an answer for that: $83.3 million.\nNo one is above the law. Loose lips sink ships. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Push is on to disband, defund UN refugee agency\n\n January 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Newspapers | Section: World \n \n 815\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. and a number of its allies — including Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Canada, France and Germany as well as the European Union — have temporarily cut off funding to the United Nations refugee and relief group in Gaza and the West Bank after allegations from Israel that some of the group's employees participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks and that even more of the staff are supportive of the Islamic militant group.Now, a Florida congressman wants to completely eliminate the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and have it operations in Gaza and the West Bank shifted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\nUNRWA provides relief supplies, medical treatment and operates schools inside Gaza and the West Bank. It has also been criticized by Israel and some conservatives in the U.S. and Europe as being pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas in the Middle East conflict.\nThe UN says 12 UNRWA employees took part in the Oct. 7 massacres inside Israel that sparked the current Holy Land war.\nAccording to UN Watch, an independent watchdog group, 75% of UNRWA's $1.16 billion annual budget comes from the U.S. and EU countries.\nThe U.S.— which is the Palestinian relief group's top donor — suspended $343.9 million in funding in response the allegations of UNRWA staff taking part in the Oct. 7 massacres. In all, more than $920.9 million in international funding for UNRWA has been frozen while the United Nations investigates the group's links to Hamas and the Oct. 7 terrorism.\n\"No more money to UNRWA. Never again,\" said Dutch Prime Minister Geert Wilders, who is part of a populist right-wing wave winning elections in Europe.\nOther countries cutting off or suspending money for UNRWA include Italy, Romania, Australia, New Zealand and Sweden.\nU.S. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Florida, wants the Biden administration to push to replace UNRWA and his legislation would potentially restrict U.S. aid to countries who oppose the change.\nThe push and temporary suspension of funding comes after Israel accused 12 UNRWA workers of actively participating in the Oct. 7 terror attacks inside Israel that killed more than 1,200 people and resulted in more than 240 hostages being taken back into Gaza.\n\"UNRWA is a front, plain and simple,\" said Rep. Mast. \"It masquerades as a relief organization while building the infrastructure to support Hamas. It is indoctrinating Palestinian children to hate all Jews and filling the future ranks of jihadists. It is literally funneling American tax dollars to terrorism. And now we know with certainty that a significant part of the UNRWA workforce are members of Palestinian terrorist organizations, including participants in the October 7th attack. No more. The United States must lead the effort to permanently disband UNRWA and end its nurturing of terrorism.\"\nUnited Nations officials and defenders of UNRWA — including some U.S. progressives opposed to American support for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's war in Gaza — want the Western funding restored\n\"More than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed in this war, seventy percent of whom are women and children. Today, hundreds of thousands of children face starvation and disease. Obviously, it's not acceptable for any of the 13,000 UNRWA employees in Gaza to be involved with Hamas, and allegations against the 12 people charged must be investigated. However, we cannot allow millions to suffer because of the actions of 12 people. The U.S. and other countries must restore funding to stave off this humanitarian catastrophe,\" said U.S Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont.\nUN officials, some of who have also routinely been critical of Israel and have been reticent to criticize sexual violence against women and girls committed by Hamas. said of the 12 UNRWA staffers accused of taking part in the Oct. 7 attacks 9 have been fired, one is dead and \"the identities of the remaining two are being clarified.\"\nUN Secretary General António Guterres has called for UNRWA funding to be restored citing worries about humanitarian and public health conditions in the Gaza war zone.\n\"UNRWA is the backbone of all humanitarian response in Gaza. I appeal to all Member States to guarantee the continuity of UNRWA's life-saving work\" — Guterres said in a statement in New York.\nThe Trump administration dramatically decreased funding to UNRWA arguing the group is too closely tied to Palestinian groups. The Biden administration restored those funding levels when it came to office.\nNikki Haley, who served as U.S. ambassador to the UN in the Trump administration and is running president, criticized Biden's previous funding restoration.\n\"I fought to cut funding to UNRWA. It was the right move then, and it's the right move now. Joe Biden never should have restarted the funding,\" Haley said.\nSome pro-Palestinian countries — including Ireland and Spain — have promised to continue to support UNRWA and offered some additional financial support even with the question about the group's employees support for Hamas and potential knowledge of its tunnel system and weapons caches. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Celebrating 95 years, Vietnam vet reflects on war, rescue efforts\n\n February 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1254\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Samuel Tiller, celebrated his 95th birthday on Nov. 25. Although he's safe at home, he sometimes stares up at the ceiling, tears in his eyes, reliving those times in the rice field. That's due to the fact he was in a firefight in the Vietnam War, where he rescued soldiers under him.After a hellish conflict, he considers himself lucky.\nThe Army gave him the purple heart and the bronze star for his bravery — luck not mentioned.\nOn his certificate it read: \"Sergeant Tiller distinguished himself by heroic actions during the Operation on 12-14, April 1964, in the Republic of Vietnam.\"\nAs much as the military is known for detail, that statement doesn't paint the picture of Sgt. 1st Class Tiller.\nIn his career he did everything from transporting officers, to drill sergeant to training the Vietnamese army. Starting in Maryland, he went from Germany, to Korea, and ultimately to Vietnam.\nAnd he doesn't have any regrets.\nFrom an early age living in Big Woods, near Worton, Tiller wanted to be a soldier. He got that chance, enlisting during a time when the military was segregated. While in the Army he suffered prejudice, but also received advice from grizzled World War II veterans.\nThey told him to advance in rank as a Black man, he had to go to the Korean War front.\nTiller remembered the heaving ocean waves as he and others climbed a rope ladder to get onboard the ship to Korea. He was fortunate being there in the waning years of the conflict.\n\"I didn't receive a scratch on me,\" Tiller said.\nIt was not unproductive. He went from a \"nothing to an E-5.\"\nA sergeant, finally, after serving for ten years.\nTiller's time in Korea allowed him to pay for his first car when he returned to Chestertown where Mary, his future wife lived.\nLike many, the military life called him back.\nBy Fountain Park, a recruiter talked to Tiller and his friends. Tiller noted that of all his friends, he was the only one who reenlisted.\nHe was whisked off to Fort Bragg — to warfare training, along with 75 officers and NCO's preparing for deployment.\nDuring that time, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Tiller recalled a sergeant, who was involved in the band, raising his hand and telling the class about it.\nSoon after, Tiller was sent to another war.\nVietnam.\nTo his wife's great concern.\nShe'd write him everyday until he was home safe.\nWhen Tiller touched ground he immediately sensed danger.\nHis role was to assist the company commander as they trained the Vietnamese army to fight the Vietcong. He moved with the Vietnamese in convoys, mingling with them, while they loaded up their chickens, rabbits, pots, pans and everything they owned.\nClose calls while in-country remain fresh on Tiller's mind.\nThe first time he sat down to eat after a convoy, somebody tossed a grenade in the window. Tiller hit the ground and squeezed his eyes shut, awaiting the explosion. It didn't happen. The pin was not pulled properly.\nA place they frequented often was blown up at the entrance he was about to choose. A bomb rigged beside a bicycle.\nTiller had close-calls and saw his share of tragedy.\nHe witnessed a translator die, reflecting on how young and intelligent the boy was.\nTiller was lonely too, in temperatures exceeding 107 degrees.\nIt was just him and the company commander and the translators.\nOne balmy Sunday that loneliness was shattered by a call.\nA battalion of hardcore Vietcong attacked a village in Tam Phu. He boarded a helicopter along with other companies — 16 Huey choppers and four Piasecki H-21's, called \"banana choppers.\"\nTiller said his helicopter was doorless and two fifty-caliber gunners thundered fire down on the Vietcong below when they approached the landing zone; an open field. Unable to hear a sound except gunfire and propellers, Tiller and the company commander evacuated, retreating for the tail of the chopper.\nVietcong were in the woodline to the left, firing on Tiller's men.\nA Vietnamese captain stood up in the middle of the conflict and was shot dead.\nHugging the ground, they deployed a \"fire and maneuver,\" action. Some soldiers engaged the enemy allowing others to retreat to the woodline.\nScrambling for it, they jumped into a ditch, pinning them down. Someone threw smoke to show their location to air support, but the dry brush caught fire. Immediately, they were caught between a spreading fire and the enemy shooting at them.\nWith bullets bearing down on him, Tiller pulled one of the wounded Vietnamese from the part of the ditch that was closer to the fire. They were in a hopeless situation, but thankfully the smoke did its job.\nA tactical fighter squadron dropped a napalm bomb on the enemy allowing Tiller's company to retreat to the woodline.\nTiller looked up and said, \"If it wasn't for that plane I wouldn't be here today.\"\nBut the Vietcong were a continual presence.\nEvery time a plane dropped a flare that night, mortars would fire off.\nThe next morning, they tried to get down a river for pickup and Vietcong pushed them back to the woodline.\nDuring that conflict, three of Tiller's guys were wounded.\nRisking his life, he told the company commander to lay down fire and cover him.\n\"I brought those guys back by myself, one at a time,\" Tiller remarked.\nThe assault continued throughout that day.\nMonday evening, a helicopter made an attempt to rescue six wounded. The enemy lurked in the woods. The helicopter had to retreat because they opened up fire again.\nFor almost three days, the threat of danger and death was imminent.\nWhen Tiller slept, it was with one eye open.\nHe was uncertain he'd make it out.\n\"I can't tell you how scared I was.\"\nOn Tuesday morning, the violence was drowned out by calm.\nWithin that silence, a chopper brought the Vietnamese Colonel and an American Major.\nThis time the enemy didn't fire back.\nU.S. forces delivered water to the war-weary and parched soldiers.\nThen they marched single-file beside the river towards the special forces camp to get picked up. Tiller was behind 15 men, but he alone set off a land mine. It knocked him down and broke two toes, with the shrapnel from the explosion striking the commander.\nTiller, who carried so many others, was carried himself, then placed on a small boat and then helicopter-bound for Saigon.\nFour-Star Gen. Wes Mooreland had visited wounded soldiers in the hospital every Sunday. On one of those times, he asked Tiller how he was. Tiller said he's alright physically but his morale was down. He hadn't received any letters from Mary since he was there.\nOrders were given.\nIf Tiller had any mail in Vietnam, Mooreland would make sure he got it.\nThat Monday after coming back from the chow hall, there were a pile of her letters on Tiller's bed.\nIt was the boost Tiller needed.\nTiller recovered and reported to headquarters, received a scolding typical of military life and was soon on the way to the Philippines. He received a hero's steak dinner, and then took a double-decker plane from California back to Philadelphia.\nWar was over.\nPhysically.\nTiller still sees Vietnam.\n\"It stays with you,\" he said.\nTiller retired from the Army in 1967. He became an employee in the Air Force working roads and grounds. A steady job, away from danger, where he could be alone with his thoughts.\nHe had a good career there. In New Jersey, where he lived, he was known for his impeccably kept yard and as, \"Big Sam the Fish Fry Man,\" cooking fish on weekends.\nOn his 95th birthday, he celebrated with his family in Chestertown with a big cookout.\nTough-as-nails, a sharp wit, and a natural storyteller, Sfc. Tiller shakes his head, \"War is hell. I know. I been through two of them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Cardin, Van Hollen back new foreign aid bill after bipartisan immigration deal dies\n\n February 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KATHARINE WILSON Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 818\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Maryland Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen have criticized Republican colleagues for blocking the bipartisan package that included border security and military aid to Ukraine.Now aid to Ukraine and Israel has new life as senators on Thursday voted 67-32 to advance consideration of the foreign aid package without an immigration component. Cardin and Van Hollen were among the \"yes\" votes.\n\"We simply cannot allow this impasse to undermine our commitments to support Ukraine, Israel, and our partners in the Indo-Pacific,\" Cardin said in a Wednesday statement.\nThe Senate failed on a procedural vote earlier Wednesday to take up the $118 billion supplemental spending bill after Republicans effectively killed the immigration reform measures aimed at addressing the massive influx of people along the U.S.-Mexico border.\nRepublicans had initially refused to consider a Ukraine aid spending bill unless it was tied to immigration reform. That included House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), who had suggested the pairing as far back as a November Fox News interview. This insistence fell away Tuesday when Republican senators declared that the package was \"dead\" after a negative review by former President Donald Trump.\n\"We can't give up, it's too important to our national security,\" Cardin insisted as Republican support for the original bipartisan bill faded.\nThe supplemental spending measure being considered by the Senate includes $60 billion to support Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel security assistance and $9 billion for humanitarian assistance in Palestinian territory and Ukraine. The package also includes sanctions against individuals involved in dealing fentanyl.\nCardin, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed frustration with Senate Republicans as GOP support for the earlier bill with immigration reforms evaporated.\n\"The failure to move this bipartisan funding package forward represents both a dereliction of American leadership on the world stage and a refusal to uphold our responsibilities to secure the integrity of our borders at home,\" Cardin said in a statement Wednesday.\nCardin added: \"I fear the consequences of deserting our allies abroad and turning our backs on critical immigration reform merely for political exploitation will have real and far-reaching implications.\"\nThe European Union announced a $54 billion aid relief package for Ukraine last week, but Cardin said that Europe's action wasn't enough.\n\"Europe has stepped up, we have to step up,\" Cardin said Tuesday. \"It affects not only our position for Ukraine, but our global influence and credibility.\"\nVan Hollen said in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that every time Republicans make new requirements to pass Ukraine funding, \"autocrats of the world celebrate\" — naming Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping.\n\"They're eager to see the US back down from the fight for democracy — and most Republicans are apparently happy to oblige,\" Van Hollen said in the post.\nThe now-failed Immigration would have given $20 billion to increase the operational needs of the U.S. Border Patrol. The bill's reform policies included barring illegal border crossings — detaining and deporting those who attempt to cross instead of processing and screening migrants — if they hit an average of 5,000 average crossings a day in a given week.\nThe bill also would have allowed officers to decide asylum cases at the border and increase requirements for asylum. The package was endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council, the union for Border Patrol agents.\nCardin called this border reform \"critical\" in a Wednesday statement.\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Florida, said in a news conference with other Republican senators Tuesday that he wouldn't vote on any bill that codified what he calls Biden's \"open border policy\" or that would give humanitarian aid money to Gaza.\nScott added that while many in his party want Ukraine to win and Russia to lose, they have different views on if and how funding should be sent.\nHe also pushed for the Republican conference to get together to make a bill that would get passed, claiming that this bipartisan deal was made behind closed doors by leadership.\n\"Why don't we start coming together as a conference to get something done?\" Scott said.\nThe package was negotiated by Sens. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Arizona. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, initially endorsed the bipartisan immigration bill but reversed himself as fellow GOP senators raised objections.\nMany Democrats in both houses said GOP lawmakers who rejected the immigration-foreign aid package were doing the bidding of Trump. Republicans, including Johnson, denied that.\nTrump called the border legislation a \"death wish\" for Republicans and called for a separate border and immigration bill Monday on Truth Social.\nBut Cardin said Wednesday that the immigration bill collapse \"makes clear that there are those in this legislative body who will prioritize fidelity to Donald Trump and his personal interests over the safety and security of our country and the global community.\"\nThe revived Senate package still faces potential procedural delays and Republican amendments. And it is unclear if the narrow Republican majority in the House will agree to the new legislation stripped of immigration reforms. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'I’m an elderly man, and I know what the hell I’m doing': Biden shoots back after special counsel cites 'poor memory'; references to conversations with dead foreign leaders\n\n February 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG Newspapers | Section: National \n \n 651\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n President Joe Biden struck back at a U.S. Justice Department's special prosecutor's report questioning his memory and mental acuity while recommending against charges for classified documents found in the 81-year-old's Delaware home and a private office in Washington after he served as vice president in the Obama administration.Special Counsel Robert Hur's report said Biden inappropriately took classified documents from during his time as vice president with some of those used to help write a memoir with a ghost writer.\nHur recommended against charges against Biden in part because he came off in interviews as a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,\" according to the report.\nThat added fuel to the fire regarding Biden's age, gaffes and memory lapses as he seeks a second-term and a looming rematch with former President Donald Trump, 77. Many voters worry about Biden's age and memory, according to public opinion polls.\n\"I am well-meaning, and I'm an elderly man, and I know what the hell I'm doing. I've been President. I put this country back on its feet. I don't need his recommendation,\" Biden said during a raucous press briefing Thursday evening after the report's release\nThe counsel's report said Biden — who was interviewed Oct. 8 and 9 just after Hamas' bloody Oct. 7 — had trouble remembering what year his son Beau Biden died (2015), details of the U.S. war in Afghanistan and the years that started and ended his term as vice president.\nAccording to the Associated Press, the special prosecutor's report described Biden's memory as \"hazy,\" \"fuzzy,\" \"faulty,\" \"poor\" and having \"significant limitations.\"\nBiden angrily denounced the prosecutor's reference to Beau Biden, who served as Delaware Attorney general and died in 2015 of brain cancer at age 46. The Democratic president frequently mentions his deceased son during public remarks.\n\"I know there's some attention paid to some language in the report about my recollection of events. There's even a reference that I don't remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that,\" Biden said during his remarks from the White House. \"Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself it wasn't any of their damn business.\"\n\"Let me tell you something. Some of you have commented — I wear, since the day he died, every single day, the rosary he got from our Lady of —,\" Biden said stopping short of naming the church. \"Every Memorial Day, we hold a service remembering him, attended by friends and family and the people who loved him. I don't need anyone — I don't need anyone to remind me when he passed away or if he passed away.\"\nReporters peppered Biden with questions about his age and memory citing the report and remarks in Las Vegas where he said he spoke to former French President Francois Mitterrand at G7 Summit in 2021. Mitterrand died in 1996.\nA White House transcript of Biden's remarks said the Democratic president meant to refer to French President Emmanuel Macron. In 2022, Biden also claimed to have spoken to former West Germany Helmut Schmidt during the same conversation at the same 2021 G7 summit. Schmidt died in 2015.\nThe White House later corrected Biden's speech transcript to refer to current German Chancellor Olaf Scholz though it was the last G7 attended by former German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nBiden shot back at White House reporters questions about public opinion polls showing as many as two-thirds of voters have concerns about memory and age.\n\"My memory is fine,\" said Biden who later misspoke and called the president of Egypt, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, the president of Mexico when talking about the situation in Gaza.\n\"I think that — as you know, initially, the President of Mexico, El-Sisi, did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in. I talked to him. I convinced him to open the gate,\" Biden said.\nThe White House later corrected to transcript to show Biden meant to say Egypt. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I watch and read until all news is wrung out of an item, article or newscast and then sink back into doldrums again.One recent hope I had was that Nikki Haley would win the Republican nomination so that voters would be able to choose between two reasonably thoughtful candidates for POTUS who exhibit good character.\nThe media is telling me that probably won't happen. My next hope was that citizens would \"tune in\" to their better angels and vote for the incumbent who has quietly (too quietly) done so much to help our country and everyone in it. Polling doesn't help me feel better yet.\nPresident Biden's list of issues still to be resolved is long and profound: our southern border, women's health, war threats on three continents and aid to the countries involved to protect democracy, a rapidly heating planet and all of the inherent dangers that accompany that fact, and artificial intelligence looming over every form of communication with the possibility of misinformation or worse.\nAnd that's just the short list.\nThere seem to be no certain paths to make course corrections on these issues because of blind loyalty to a cult leader who seems to have never had a selfless thought in his charmed life.\nOur Congress, our Senate and our Supreme Court all contain cult followers. Why is it that grown men and women with multiple, advanced degrees can't look into the future of this country and make decisions based on the logic they're supposed to have acquired?\nPlease allow us some ray of hope for the America we love. Each of us only has one vote. Find out what candidates for any and all offices have in their hearts and vote in all elections on all levels.\nVICKI SPARKS\nFishing Creek \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Taylor Swift: A powder keg about to explode\n\n February 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEVEN V. ROBERTS | Section: Columns \n \n 769\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A recent cartoon in The New Yorker depicts a gloomy pair of campaign workers surrounded by posters urging people to vote. One laments, \"I worry that democracy's only hope is Taylor Swift.\"Funny, yes. But also potentially prophetic. While in most election years celebrity endorsements make a minimal impact, this year could be different.\nThe contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is likely to be very close, with a handful of votes in a handful of states deciding the outcome. And Biden is an unusually unpopular incumbent who stirs little enthusiasm even among his core supporters.\nHe needs a spark — a source of excitement — especially among younger voters who helped elect him in 2020 but are drifting into indifference. Few of them will vote for Trump. The real threat to Biden is that they will back third parties or simply stay home.\n\"The youth vote, as we all know, is going to be crucial in this election,\" notes Erin Heys, policy director for the University of California, Berkeley's Institute for Young Americans. If Swift \"does make an endorsement, she has the potential to sway a lot of young voters. She and other cultural influencers can do a lot to signal to young people, 'Hey, your vote does matter'. ... (A Swift endorsement) could really change the game for those people who, in the current moment, feel disillusioned with the whole political and economic system.\"\nBiden World might well be channeling this lyric from Swift's song \"August\": \"To live for the hope of it all.\"\nHere's why: Time magazine named her Person of the Year for 2023. Her Eras Tour grossed over $1 billion last year, making it the most profitable musical tour ever. Last week, she won a Grammy for album of the year for the fourth time. A Morning Consult poll found that 53% of Americans are fans of Swift's music, with 16% calling themselves \"Swifties,\" or especially ardent followers.\nAnd there's mounting evidence of her political clout. Last fall, when she urged her Instagram followers to register to vote, vote.org saw a surge of 35,000 registrants. In a Newsweek poll, 18% said they were more likely to back a candidate supported by Swift, but that rose to 3 out of 10 among younger voters.\nHer possible impact is bolstered by the changing nature of political campaigning, which increasingly takes place online. The website Exploding Topics calculates that she has a total of 534 million followers on all social media sites combined — the fourth-highest total of anyone in the world — with 280 million of them on Instagram alone.\n\"Celebrity power in elections has grown because celebrity power itself has grown,\" communications consultant James Haggerty said to Newsweek. \"Media and social media are now the central organizing framework of many Americans' lives. And in a world awash in messages, it's the celebrity voices that really resonate.\"\nEarly in her career, Swift shied away from politics, fearful that she would alienate some possible Swifties. But in 2020, she backed Biden, and a statement she made to V Magazine illuminates her priorities: \"The change we need most is to elect a president who recognizes that people of color deserve to feel safe and represented, that women deserve the right to choose what happens to their bodies and that the LGBTQIA+ community deserves to be acknowledged and included.\"\nSince then, the Dobbs decision that canceled a national right to abortion could only intensify her interest in the upcoming election. Republicans are already anticipating her participation, with some unhinged operatives trying to undermine her credibility by implying she's part of a nefarious conspiracy — along with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, a tight end with the Kansas City Chiefs — to throw the election to Biden and the Super Bowl to the Chiefs.\nReince Priebus, who ran the Republican National Committee under Trump, derided the conspiracy theories as \"a powder keg of stupidity,\" and added, with some degree of wonder, \"You're talking about two of the most popular things in America right now. Taylor Swift and the NFL.\"\nIf Swift does back Biden, she's almost certain to enrage Trump, who has a long history of attacking powerful women who challenge his ego. His insults — from \"Crooked\" Hillary Clinton and \"Crazy\" Nancy Pelosi to \"Birdbrain\" Nikki Haley — show clearly the man cannot help himself.\nTaylor Swift is richer, younger and more popular than Donald Trump. Think about what he would call her, and how the Swifties would react. That particular \"powder keg of stupidity\" could blow up in his face. And reelect Joe Biden.\nSteven Roberts teaches politics and journalism at George Washington University.

    "content": "Think about the scene if Gaza were Chicago\n\n February 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RUSSELL VANDENBROUCKE | Section: Columns \n \n 744\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Might Americans make sense of Gaza if we compared it to our own experience? What if Gaza were Chicago, my childhood home?Each is home to more than two million people in a narrow strip along a shore. The sun rises over 28 miles of Lake Michigan and sets on Gaza's 30 miles of Mediterranean coast.\nCONTRASTI used to drink from Lake Michigan by opening a tap. Gazans face a challenge beyond their salty sea: Israel consolidated water control 50 years ago and requires an army permit to build new installations or infrastructure. Gazans consume less water daily than the World Health Organization recommends; Israelis use more.\nAfter my parents explained how Lake Michigan was too wide to gaze across, they promised to take me to the opposite shore, and they did. Palestinian families cannot answer the call of open water to a wider world as we did.\nInstead of beckoning Gazans toward the horizon, their sea is a barrier: Israel's \"maritime security blockade\" prevents them from sailing where winds and currents take them, and fishing is restricted too. Unlike the Port of Chicago linking the Midwest to the Atlantic through the St. Lawrence Seaway, Gaza has no shipping infrastructure, and Israel prohibits small boats from approaching: nine pro-Palestinian activists were killed in 2011 as their flotilla tried to aid Gaza.\nWhen my father parked his precious Pontiac beside an open field near O'Hare Airport, the cyclic drama of take-offs and landings offered free entertainment on a Sunday afternoon. Years before I became the first in our family to live this drama from inside a plane, I imagined myself aloft.\nPalestinians cannot do the same: Israel permits no airports in Gaza, the West Bank, or East Jerusalem, territories it first occupied in 1967.\nAs a boy, if I pretended to camp by pitching a tent in the backyard, I could sneak back to bed as soon as the dark sky and suburban wilds frightened me. In Gaza, where more than 70 percent of the homes have been destroyed, tents provide refuge from wind, rain and cold for dispossessed families, many of whom have fractured: UNICEF reports that at least 17,000 children are now unaccompanied or separated from their parents.\nImagine the psychic toll on children whose homes are bombed into rubble. When a quarry, three blocks from my childhood home, blasted the bedrock to mine the limestone, our walls shimmied. This irritated my mother, but we were never afraid or in danger; the plaster did not crack. What is the future for Gazans who suffer trauma daily when, research shows, violence harms the cognitive development of infants even before they can speak?\nAlthough I adore Chicago enough to be an unpaid ambassador, I know gang violence and drugs made its 2022 murder rate No. 28 in the U.S. The rate dipped 11 percent the next year, but 613 remains a huge number — and only half the scale of Hamas's indefensible massacre of 1,200 Israelis.\nThis tragedy, widely considered the worst Jews have suffering since the Holocaust, leads to a hunger for vengeance and Prime Minister Netanyahu's call for \"absolute victory\" and \"annihilation\" of Hamas. His rhetoric sounds like \"the ends justify the means\" wedded to \"by any means necessary.\"\nCollective punishment, long an instrument of Israeli \"justice,\" obliterates the distinction between combatants and non-combatants. More densely populated than Chicago, Gaza also has bigger families, as usual with poor societies compared to wealthy ones. Since 47 percent of its population is under 18, it follows inexorably that nearly half the 27,000 Gazans who have died in Palestine's current catastrophe, are children. Their numbers grows daily.\nPAYING FOR SLAUGHTERI pay no taxes to my hometown, but I must to my nation, which provides $3.3 billion in annual military aid to Israel, the world's 29th largest economy and its 10th biggest exporter of armaments. Congress is now considering $14 billion of supplemental military aid even as the Pentagon is \"not putting any limits on how Israel uses weapons,\" including the most destructive ones we provide for the slaughter, 500 and 2,000-pound bombs.\nAlas, they eerily echo the bellicose jingoism of our national anthem: \"the rocket's red glare, the bomb bursting in air.\" In the dawn's early light — and throughout the rest of the day and night too — I can see my hands stained by the blood of Gazans, especially its children.\nRussell Vandenbroucke recently retired as professor of theater and was the founding director of the Peace, Justice and Conflict Transformation Program at the University of Louisville. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Van Hollen, Democrats plan push for stronger policy protecting civilians from American weapons\n\n February 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TORRENCE BANKS Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 804\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Even though the White House has taken steps aimed at protecting civilians from American weapons in war zones, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) said Tuesday that he would press for a stronger response, especially in light of Israel's continued bombardment of Gaza.\"I fully support Israel's right, indeed its duty, to defend itself,\" the senator said in a statement. \"But while a war may be just, it must be fought justly. I cannot support a blank check for the Netanyahu government's current campaign in Gaza. The disregard for innocent civilian life and the mounting humanitarian catastrophe are too great to turn a blind eye.\"\nVan Hollen praised a national security memorandum issued last Friday by President Joe Biden in which he outlined U.S. policy on safeguarding civilians in places where American weapons and military equipment are used. Israel is not specifically mentioned in the memorandum.\n\"...As a matter of policy, the United States always seeks to promote adherence to international law and encourages other states and partners to do the same,\" the memorandum states. \"United States policy…is for executive departments and agencies to engage with foreign partners to share and learn best practices for reducing the likelihood of and responding to civilian casualties…\"\nThe memorandum was similar to an amendment Van Hollen announced with his colleagues on Feb. 7. It was not included in the national security supplemental spending bill passed yesterday.\nAccording to the memorandum, before receiving United States military aid, countries must confirm in writing that they will comply with international humanitarian law.\n\"This is a very big deal, and it will give President Biden and the United States more tools and more leverage to ensure… that U.S. military assistance, complies with American values and American interests,\" Van Hollen said during a press conference last Friday.\nCountries must also promise not to hinder the United States' ability to provide humanitarian assistance to conflict areas where American weapons are being used.\nAccording to the Associated Press, the number of Palestinians killed in the Israel-Hamas war, which began after the militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, surpassed 25,000 on Jan. 21.\nThe Van Hollen amendment had 18 sponsors, including Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virginia), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon).\n\"This extreme level of civilian harm in Gaza is a moral failure, and now it is fueling an even wider conflict in the region,\" Warren said.\nVan Hollen said that he and his colleagues will work to turn the Biden policy into law, preventing future administrations from easily reversing it.\n\"It's been rolling a rock uphill,\" Warren said regarding making changes to United States military aid policy in the past. \"When it feels like the conflict is far away and nobody knows who the parties are and what's actually happening on the ground, it's hard to get Congress to move.\"\nMerkley and Van Hollen traveled to the Rafah border crossing from Gaza into the Sinai in early January and saw first-hand how the conflict and deplorable conditions created difficulty getting aid to the hospitals and warehouses in the region.\n\"These factors together have caused the seasoned humanitarian workers who have worked in the worst conflicts in the world to tell Chris and I, when we were at the Rafah gate, that they have never seen anything as bad as Gaza,\" Merkley said.\nThe Van Hollen amendment only applied to countries receiving military aid from the United States under the national security supplemental spending bill. The Biden memorandum now applies to all countries receiving United States military assistance, including Ukraine and Israel.\nKaine said that he and his colleagues got on a call with the White House about their amendment in December expecting more resistance. While there was some pushback, Kaine said that no one ever came up with any substantive reason to oppose the principles of the amendment.\n\"Human rights should not be separate from the American defense mission,\" Kaine said. \"And when we determined that it's in our interest to assist an ally, that ally should conduct itself in the way we would.\"\nDurbin made it clear that he and his colleagues support Israel's defense. However, he acknowledged that members of Hamas hiding among civilians in the area has helped create a \"humanitarian nightmare.\"\n\"We still need to demand and require realistic effective standards to reduce civilian harm,\" Durbin said.\nCountries currently engaged in war using United States weapons have 45 days to ensure that Biden receives the written assurances that they are adhering to international law. If those countries don't meet the deadline, then the United States will suspend their assistance.\nTo ensure that countries are complying with the best practices for reducing civilian harm, the State Department and the Defense Department must submit reports to Congress discussing weapons usage in areas of armed conflict.\nReports must be submitted within 90 days and include information on weapons usage dating back to Jan. 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hogan’s run for U.S. Senate is all the buzz among former Capitol colleagues\n\n February 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LYDIA HURLEY Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 840\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Larry Hogan's recent decision to run for U.S. Senate comes as a shock to many state lawmakers — especially Democrats who worked with the former Republican governor and think he wasn't all that cooperative with the legislature.Now, he's aiming to serve as a lawmaker himself, this time on the national level.\nSenate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) told reporters this week he thought the former governor \"did not seem to be an enthusiast of the legislative process.\"\n\"I was very taken aback to see that he is interested in introducing bills, working with legislators, trying to create coalitions to build consensus and pass laws,\" Ferguson said. \"That's the role of the U.S. Senate.\"\nOver a month into the legislative session, Maryland lawmakers are hard at work on their own initiatives in Annapolis. Still, Hogan's decision to run for Senate has been the talk of the town for many of them.\nNearly a year after his term ended and Democratic Gov. Wes Moore took office, Hogan's legacy remains a topic of controversy that echoes through the halls of the State House. The former governor vetoed some of Democrats' favorite bills on topics like abortion, gun restrictions and an education blueprint.\nMoore himself aimed a punch at Hogan during the State of the State address on Feb. 7, saying that the former executive spent too much time picking fights with the legislature instead of showing \"real leadership and engagement\" in Annapolis.\nHogan could potentially have some appeal to moderate and independent voters in a general election, as a frequent critic of former president Donald Trump. But Maryland Democrats say this shouldn't qualify him as a moderate in the minds of voters.\nIn his first interview since he announced his Senate campaign, Hogan said that it's \"not necessary\" to enshrine the right to abortion in Maryland's constitution, though he would oppose an outright nationwide abortion ban, according to the Baltimore Banner.\nDemocrats were quick to offer their critique.\n\"Anyone who thinks that there is no threat to women's reproductive rights and abortion access is delusional,\" Gov. Moore said in response to Hogan's comments on Wednesday.\nMoore said the country has seen the Supreme Court \"dismantle decades of precedent overnight,\" and he asserted that Republicans continue to \"stand by\" as women's reproductive rights are attacked across the country.\nThis November, Marylanders will be asked to vote on whether to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution. In 2023, the General Assembly voted to include a referendum on the November 2024 ballot.\nHogan's administration commits to \"finding common ground for a common good,\" according to a statement on his Senate campaign website. Hogan's campaign boasts eight years of successful tax cuts, a balanced budget and a record surplus as governor.\nCapital News Service has reached out to Hogan's campaign several times this week for comment but received no reply.\nSome Maryland Republicans believe Hogan has a chance of winning. He has proven he can win in Maryland on a statewide basis and can find a way to map out how to be successful, said Sen. Stephen Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline).\n\"A U.S. senator election is going to be certainly based on presidential turnout, where the national candidates are at the time, so many different things that come into play during those elections,\" said Hershey.\nHogan was one of the Republican party's more outspoken critics of former president Donald Trump, who is likely to be at the top of the ticket in the fall. Hogan even claimed he voted for late former president Ronald Reagan over Trump in 2020.\n\"We haven't had a Republican in the U.S. Senate from Maryland since the '80s. It will be a challenge for him,\" Del. Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said. A win for Hogan is going to be an \"uphill climb,\" Buckel said.\nAfter the former governor vetoed several bills with widespread support from Democratic lawmakers, there is \"no chance\" Democrats in Maryland are going to vote for Hogan, Sen. Cheryl Kagan (D-Montgomery) said.\n\"He has a terrible record that he's now going to have to defend. It's hard to imagine how he could be successful,\" Kagan said.\nKagan also voiced concerns about the impression that Hogan is a moderate. \"He's not nearly as moderate as his PR people try to make us believe,\" Kagan said.\nSenator Benjamin Kramer (D-Montgomery) echoed this sentiment.\n\"Although he has done an outstanding job of creating this impression that he is a moderate, he is far from that,\" Kramer said.\nDereck E. Davis, the state treasurer, a Democrat, said a Hogan win could threaten Democratic control over the U.S. Senate.\n\"If they were to vote for Gov. Hogan, effectively they're voting for Mitch McConnell,\" said Davis, referring to the Senate Republican leader from Kentucky. \"It could flip the Senate.\"\nStill, he said, it never hurts to have a different point of view like the one Hogan might bring to the national Republican party.\n\"It's always good to have diversity of thought. I'm not going to get into internal Republican Party politics,\" he said. \"But I think it's healthy when you have various viewpoints ... It's great not to have groupthink and rather to have competing ideas.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Larry Hogan that he is running to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin triggered immediate and widespread speculation on if he will be the first Maryland Republican to be elected to the Senate since 1980.Larry Sabato veteran political observer at the University of Virginia has shown caution in his reaction to this news.\nFor now, Sabato has shifted his rating on the race to replace Cardin from \"safe Democratic\" to \"likely Democratic.\"\nHe has done so assuming Larry Hogan will be the Republican nominee.\nThis is a good assumption but not a given.\nCurrently there are currently six other Republicans who have filed for the nomination with the state Board of Elections for the spring Republican primary election.\nConventional political wisdom is Hogan will be the Republican nominee.\nNow more than ever conventional wisdom in the political world has been turned upside down and sideways.\nThe political world is now a VUCA world, one characterized by high and increasing levels of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity.\nRecall the conventional wisdom when Larry Hogan announced his first campaign for governor.\nConventional wisdom then was no Republican could win statewide in deep blue Maryland.\nUndaunted and with a memorable message that resonated deeply with Maryland voters — \"Change Maryland\" — Larry Hogan went on to defeat the incumbent lieutenant governor and then was reelected to a second term.\nConventional wisdom was wrong.\nAfter eight years of years of Hogan serving as governor, conventional wisdom was that Kelly Schulz would be the Republican nominee to succeed Hogan.\nSchulz was a former Republican member in the Maryland House of Delegates, a former Hogan cabinet secretary for two departments — the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, and the Department of Commerce — and was endorsed by Gov. Hogan.\nConventional wisdom was Kelly could be branded as best person to continue Gov. Hogan's governing philosophy and style that resulted in extraordinarily high job performance ratings during his two terms.\nFormer Maryland House of Delegates member Dan Cox opposed her in the primary.\nCox's frustration with Hogan's policies (especially his aggressive public lockdown policies on COVID-19 control) and Hogan's moderate approach to governing led to a decision by Cox to introduce a House resolution to impeach Hogan.\nWhile that resolution went nowhere in the House of Delegates, it energized and mobilized enough Republican primary voters who shared Cox's frustration with Hogan to propel Cox to winning the GOP gubernatorial nomination.\nConventional wisdom was wrong again.\nIn a VUCA political world, there is no question that Larry Hogan is a gifted politician who twice proved conventional wisdom wrong.\nThere is also no question he is a politician whose decision to pursue a run for the U.S. Senate reflects thinking that fortune favors the bold.\nThe question to be determined is will his bold move in increasingly blue Maryland result in his election to the U.S. Senate and perhaps beyond or be recorded in his biography as a noble but impossible goal.\nAs they often say in the TV news world — \"stay tuned as this is a developing story.\"\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore on Friday denounced an Alabama Supreme Court ruling last week that frozen embryos have the same rights as children.Moore, a Democrat, said that the judges' decision was completely \"out of step\" with where citizens in the country are.\n\"And I think it's another indication of why elections matter in this,\" Moore said in an interview with Capital News Service outside the White House following a National Governors Association meeting with President Joe Biden. \"Because let's not forget, the people who we elect are the ones who are also helping to appoint these judges.\"\nThe unprecedented Alabama ruling stated that those who damage embryos created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) can be criminally prosecuted.\nThe decision came from a lawsuit filed by three couples against the Center for Reproductive Medicine after embryos conceived using IVF were destroyed on their watch.\nAccording to the CDC, IVF is the most popular assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment. Approximately 2.3% of children born in the United States each year are conceived using ART.\nMoore was among nearly three dozen governors at the NGA's winter meeting session at the White House with Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Cabinet members and other administration officials.\nThe governors discussed bipartisan solutions to artificial intelligence risks, disaster response and housing affordability among other issues.\n\"It was a great meeting because you get a chance to see with all the other governors, both Democrat and Republican, that a lot of the opportunities and challenges we're seeing are pretty universal,\" Moore said.\nMoore said that he and Biden spoke specifically about providing support for military families and military spouses, as well as solutions to the border crisis and methods to further improve the nation's economy.\nHe also praised Biden for his support in helping him address the housing crisis in Maryland.\nMoore noted that he recently introduced and testified on bills that would set up a state renters' rights office, increase liquidity for first-time homebuyers, and ensure that the state works with local jurisdictions to address zoning restrictions.\n\"And so we're grateful that in Maryland, we're gonna get a lot of big things done on housing this year,\" Moore said. \"But that's because it's being done in partnership with the White House.\"\nIn remarks to the governors gathered in the White House's East Room, Biden thanked the states' chief executives for being \"incredible partners.\"\n\"Governors know the measure of success isn't how many partisan points we score,\" the president said. \"It's: Did we fix the problem? Did we fix the problem?\"\n\"We disagree on how to fix the problem many times,\" Biden continued. \"We're all here for one reason: to fix the problems — to get things done for families, for communities, for the country.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Larry Hogan faces obstacles in Senate run\n\n February 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 752\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Larry Hogan's recently announced U.S. Senate campaign is off to a good start.Shortly after his announcement, a survey conducted by Emerson College Polling, The Hill and DC News Now showed Hogan tied with one possible strong Democratic opponent (David Trone), with 42% supporting each in a general election matchup and 16% undecided. The survey also showed Hogan leads in a general election matchup with another possible strong Democratic candidate (Angela Alsobrooks) 44% to 37%, with 19% undecided. The Republican primary survey results showed Hogan at 43%, undecided at 43% and none of the other candidates at more than 9%. All the survey results have a 3% plus or minus margin of error.\nRecently, one conservative candidate from Anne Arundel County withdrew from the Republican primary and endorsed Hogan.\nIn Larry Sabato's widely read and influential Political Crystal Ball, J. Miles Coleman wrote \"In response to Hogan's announcement, we downgraded our rating for Maryland from Safe Democratic to Likely Democratic.\" That news will energize and mobilize donors who had previously viewed a Democratic win as a given.\nGoing forward there are still at least three obstacles facing Hogan. All are formidable but none are insurmountable.\nThe first obstacle is Robin Ficker in the Republican primary. Ficker is aggressively appealing to Republican primary voters who may still be angry over some of Hogan's actions while serving as governor. Those actions include Hogan's unwavering support for COVID-19 lockdown mandates, moderate governing style, criticisms of Donald Trump and Trump supporters, and his refusal to support Dan Cox for governor after Cox defeated Hogan's endorsed candidate to succeed him in a GOP primary.\nTo conservative Republican primary voters considering Ficker, Hogan can remind them of a guiding principle of conservative of conservative icon William F. Buckley and often repeated by conservative icon Ronald Reagan — support the most conservative candidate … who can win.\nThe second obstacle is the Democratic candidate for November ramping up a messaging blitz (already launched by Trone and Alsobrooks) that was highly effective in the last midterm elections. That message is all Republican candidates are a grave threat to abortion rights and all are aligned with Donald Trump.\nTo all voters with concerns over the future of abortion rights, Hogan can remind them he is on record saying that as a senator, he will not vote for a national abortion ban. He can also tell them he will respect the outcome of a statewide referendum in Maryland on an amendment adding the right to an abortion to the state constitution.\nThe third obstacle is all of Hogan's opponents in the primary and general elections reminding voters about all the reasons Hogan gave when he was strongly encouraged but declined to run against incumbent U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen.\nTo all voters concerned about those reasons, Hogan can remind them the public record includes the reasons why he is running now. In reviewing that record it is clear Hogan mentioned: \"I said I wasn't going to walk away from politics, I was going to try to be a voice, standing up to try to fix things, and you can't just sit back and complain about things if you're not willing to try to make a difference.\"\nHogan can say his willingness \"to try to make a difference\" reflects his acceptance of the call to action in Teddy Roosevelt's Man in the Arena speech:\nIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.\nIt will be most interesting to see what Larry Hogan's 2024 campaign strategy and messages will be.\nMore interesting will be if his messages in this election cycle will resonate with a majority of Maryland voters just as his Change Maryland message did when he was elected governor.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Biden in a bind: Left-wing, anti-war pressure challenges reelection, long-standing support for Israel\n\n March 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Newspapers | Section: World \n \n 1075\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. military started air dropping aid into Gaza Saturday as U.S. President Joe Biden faces pressure from many Democrats who want Israel to agree to a ceasefire in its war against Hamas after the Oct. 7 terror attacks.Anti-war and pro-Palestinian pressure from the left challenges Biden's long-standing support for Israel as he faces a tight reelection race against former president Donald Trump.\nBiden has also received more financial support from pro-Israel groups and advocates than any other U.S. politician over the last four decades, according to the Center for Responsive Politics which looked at campaign donations since 1990.\nU.S. MILITARY DROPPING AID IN GAZA\nAccording to the Associated Press, U.S. military C-130 cargo planes on Saturday dropped food in pallets over Gaza, three U.S. officials said, two days after more than 100 Palestinians who had surged to pull goods off an aid convoy were killed during a chaotic encounter with Israeli troops.\nThree planes from Air Forces Central dropped 66 bundles containing about 38,000 meals into Gaza at 8:30 a.m. EST, according to two of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity before a public announcement, the AP reported.\nBiden said Friday the U.S. would start air dropping aid into the Hamas-controlled Palestinian area where more than 30,000 people have died since the start of the war. Another 7,800 people are missing with a good number of those presumed dead within the rubble of the Holy Land war.\nMore than 1,400 Israelis have died since the war started in October. Israeli officials say they have killed 10,000 Hamas and other Islamic militant fighters in the war.\nEarlier in the week before the Michigan presidential primary, Biden played up the possibility of a ceasefire in Gaza. Yesterday and today, Biden also talked up a potential 6-week ceasefire that could start before the Muslim holiday of Ramadan (which begins March 10).\nBut Hamas continues to hold Israeli hostages taken In the Oct. 7 attacks and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to continue the war to dismantle the Islamic militant group.\n\"This week a Harvard CAPS-Harris poll was published; it determined that 82% of the American public supports Israel. That is to say - more than 4 out 5 U.S. citizens support us and not Hamas. This broad support gives us redoubled energy to continue the campaign until total victory,\" Netanyahu said in a statement.\nBIDEN'S LONG SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL\nBiden has been a steadfast supporter of Israel during this 51-year tenure in U.S. politics, while serving in the U.S. as vice president in the Obama administration and now as U.S. president.\nBiden has declared himself \"a Zionist\" supporting the Jewish state of Israel on multiple occasions including in December at Hanukkah celebration at the White House.\nSince 1990, Biden has received close to $10 million in donations from pro-Israel groups and advocates according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That's the most of any U.S. politician.\nBut Public opinion polls show wide swaths of Democrats, especially younger and Muslim voters, support a ceasefire and oppose Netanyahu's war after the Oct. 7 attacks.\nThat showed up in the Michigan primary where 13.2% of Democrats voted uncommitted and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, who was not actively campaigning, got 3% of the vote.\nMichigan is a key battleground in the general election.\nTrump received 758,892 votes in the GOP primary versus Nikki Haley compared to 623,415 for Biden who isn't facing substantial opposition.\nPRESSURE FROM THE LEFT\nLeft-wing advocates — including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont — have stepped up their pushes against Israel's war in Gaza and want to put more strings on U.S. military aid to Israel — which totals more than $3 billion annually.\n\"Netanyahu and his right-wing government have created a catastrophe in Gaza. Today Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinians desperate for aid. The U.S. must push for a cease-fire, hostage releases, & condition military support on pursuing a two-state solution for a lasting peace,\" Warren said Feb. 29.\nSanders is also pushing against U.S. support for Netanyahu's government and Israel's war effort against Hamas.\nThe U.S. government designates the Islamic group as a terrorist organization.\n\"Children are starving in Gaza. Instead of opening up the borders and allowing humanitarian aid to come in, Israeli soldiers are shooting people who are desperately trying to get food off of trucks. This must stop. The U.S. cannot continue funding the Netanyahu war machine,\" Sanders said Feb. 29.\nThat has pushed Biden and his presidential campaign – which is in 50/50 race with Trump — to press for a ceasefire and launch the airdrops.\n\"We're trying to work out a deal between Israel and Hamas (with) the hostages being returned and (an) immediate ceasefire in Gaza for at least the next six weeks,\" Biden said.\nCLOSED BORDERS\nThe humanitarian situation in Gaza is magnified by Egypt and Jordan refusing to allow Palestinian refugees from their war zones into their countries, the lack of international pressure, including from other Muslim countries and Europe, on Hamas to release Israeli hostages and Palestinian militants also wanting to keep civilians in Gaza as shields against Israel Defense Forces and over worries about Israel taking over the area after the war.\nInternational aid groups — many of which are critical of Israel and U.S. support for the war with some taking pro-Palestinian stances in the Middle East conflict— have said the U.S. aid is more about optics than alleviating suffering from war.\n\"Oxfam does not support U.S. airdrops to Gaza, which would mostly serve to relieve the guilty consciences of senior U.S. officials whose policies are contributing to the ongoing atrocities and risk of famine in Gaza,\" said Scott Paul, associate director for Oxfam America. \"While Palestinians in Gaza have been pushed to the absolute brink, dropping a paltry, symbolic amount of aid into Gaza with no plan for its safe distribution would not help and be deeply degrading to Palestinians.\"\nAid groups have criticized Israel for not allowing more aid via trucks amid concerns from the IDF that those supplies have and will continue to be taken by Hamas.\nIDF officials said the Thursday event where Gazans were killed during a chaotic mob scene involving an aid convoy only involved Israeli soldiers firing warning shots to try to disperse the mob.\n\"This morning humanitarian aid trucks entered northern Gaza, residents surrounded the trucks and looted the supplies being delivered. As a result of the pushing, trampling and being run over by the trucks, dozens of Gazans were killed and injured,\" an IDF spokesman said Thursday.\nPalestinians contend the IDF shot at the Gazans resulting in the stampede. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Facing retirement from Congress, Ruppersberger says he is sad to leave",
    "date": "2024-03-02",

    "content": "Facing retirement from Congress, Ruppersberger says he is sad to leave\n\n March 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: YESENIA MONTENEGRO Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1152\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Many people who retire from Congress are ready to leave the long days, partisan infighting, frustrating pace of legislation, endless fundraising and time away from family.But Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Maryland) isn't quite ready to say goodbye yet, despite announcing his retirement after 40 years in public office.\n\"I'm not happy and I don't want to leave, but I got five grandchildren,\" Ruppersberger, who turned 78 in January, said in an interview with Capital News Service in his memento-filled office with a view of the United States Capitol.\nRuppersberger's political career started in Baltimore, where he was elected to the Baltimore County Council in the 1980s. In 1994 and 1998 he was elected Baltimore County executive.\nHis time in Congress began in 2002 when he was elected to represent Maryland's Second District.\nOriginally he wanted to run for governor, not Congress, Ruppersberger said. But he decided that if he could get on the House Intelligence Committee he would run for the House.\nThe avuncular Ruppersberger credits much of his political success to his teamwork and his bipartisanship. A good team is necessary to take care of constituents, he said.\n\"I was very bipartisan,\" Ruppersberger said. \"And you have to be when you're county executive, local government. You have to be bipartisan, you work on all sorts, from business to people who are on welfare. There's so many issues.\"\nRuppersberger's district is made up of large parts of Baltimore and Carroll Counties and a part of Baltimore City. He is in his 11th term in the House.\n\"You have to go out and see the people,\" Ruppersberger said. \"You can't sit in an office and think you're gonna get elected. You have to have people on your team who will go out every day and represent you in the community.\nRuppersberger was motivated to get involved in politics after a major car crash he was involved in when he was 28. He was left with 15 broken bones and was in bad shape. He credits the Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland for saving his life. Dr. R. Adams Cowley, who founded the trauma center, encouraged Ruppersberger to run for office.\nRuppersberger has supported trauma centers extensively throughout his career and serves as vice chairman of Shock Trauma's Board of Visitors.\n\"I know I had brain damage or I wouldn't be in politics,\" Ruppersberger joked.\nDuring his time in Congress, Ruppersberger has worked on several successful projects.\nOne that stands out is the Hero Miles program, which donates airline tickets to members of the armed forces. Ruppersberger said he noticed that when troops overseas were flown back to the United States they were only taken to a few airports, then would have to pay for their connecting flights home. He fought for this to change and to have Hero Miles put in place in 2003.\nRuppersberger did end up serving on the House Intelligence Committee, where he spent 12 years. In 2011, he was named the ranking member of the committee. The post qualified him as a member of the so-called \"gang of eight,\" a group of House and Senate lawmakers privy to classified briefings on the country's top-secret intelligence activities.\n\"I like the action,\" Ruppersberger said. \"I like being able to make a difference, which you can in the gang of eight, and I like working with bipartisan people... It was the first time that the House and the Senate, really the gang of eight, came together and worked for the country. And I really, really liked that.\"\nWhile on the intelligence panel, Ruppersberger traveled around the world to countries including Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan and China.\nAlong with the then-committee chairman, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Alabama, he became the first dual recipient of the William Oliver Baker Award from the nonpartisan Intelligence and National Security Alliance for their bipartisanship.\n\"We told people that whether you're Democrat and Republican, whether you're the majority or minority, we're going to run this as a team,\" Ruppersberger said. \"And we're not fooling around, we're gonna get a lot done. And if you don't do that, we're going to ask that you leave the committee.\"\nSince 2015, Ruppersberger has served on the House Appropriations Committee, where he specializes in national security. The committee allocates billions of federal dollars every year and is powerful because it has the final say on spending. Ruppersberger said that the position has allowed him to allocate money for Maryland and his district while also working on national issues.\nRuppersberger refers to himself as an \"action guy,\" which is why he's going to have a hard time retiring, he said.\nHe said he plans to continue working on projects and causes he is working on now even after he leaves office.\nWhat made the decision to retire even harder was the current state of Congress, which he said was enduring \"some of the worst times\" he's ever seen.\n\"I think Congress itself is not doing what they need to do,\" he said. \"You know you're always gonna have a majority, minority, and the majority is gonna get more than the minority. But right now, what's happening with the Republicans, basically they agree on something and then they disagree…and it's just not right. I'd like people to reach out to both sides of the aisle.\"\nThree of Maryland's eight House seats are open this election cycle. In addition to Ruppersberger, Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes, who represents Maryland's Third District, also is retiring. And Democratic Rep. David Trone is leaving Maryland's Sixth District seat to run for the Senate.\nRuppersberger said that the next generation of lawmakers must work together, which he will emphasize to the candidate who will take over his spot. He has already endorsed Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski, who is running in a contested Second District Democratic primary to succeed Ruppersberger, and Trone in his bid for the Senate.\nRuppersberger believes there is a \"very good possibility\" that Democrats will gain the majority in the House in the November elections. The Republicans currently hold a thin 219-213 advantage in the House.\n\"The Republicans couldn't even elect a speaker, it took them six people,\" Ruppersberger said. \"They keep changing their minds. You need strong leadership and somebody who can stand up to your own party. You got to lead.\"\nDemocrats are doing a good job at talking about what could make a difference to help and support people, Ruppersberger said. A lot of people are hurting in this country, he added.\nPassing bills such as providing funding for Ukraine and Israel will hold the nation together and make it stronger, he said.\n\"I have 10 more months here and I plan on doing what I've always been doing,\" Ruppersberger said. \"Doing the best I can…And I'm not happy about leaving, I'm sad.\"\n\"...Life will take care of itself,\" the congressman said. \"I have a lot of experience and a lot of friends so, in the end, I'll be fine. I just need some time not to be sad about leaving this. It's been my life for a long time.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Politics in driver's seat on Biden thinking on electric vehicles\n\n March 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 570\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recently, multiple media outlets reported the Biden administration may revise a previously announced schedule on mandated new limits on emissions from vehicles using fossil fuels.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) projected these new limits would lead to 67% of new cars and light-duty trucks sales being all-electric by 2032, an enormous increase given current sales of 7.6% in 2023.\nRecent news from Ford makes that increase projection appear even more enormous. Last month, Ford announced they are reducing production of the F-150 Lightning all electric pickup truck from the previously planned production rate of 3,200 per week to about 1,600 per week based on soft demand for EVs in the U.S. auto market.\nThe current emission mandate schedule has been strongly opposed by the United Auto Workers union, by manufacturers of about 97% of the new vehicles sold in the United States, and by 4,000 new car dealerships across the country.\nA new version is on its way. One may ask why and why now?\nThe sub headline in a recent New York Times article says it all.\n\"The change to planned rules was an election-year concession to labor unions and auto executives, according to people familiar with the plan.\"\nThis is not surprising. Opposition to and political consequences of maintaining the current schedule has been noticed by the Biden re-election campaign.\nLabor support has long been a key element of an enduring political coalition used most effectively by the Democratic Party, in national elections and especially so especially in vote rich blue states.\nThat labor support for Biden was first put to a test last year when the EPA initially proposed the new emission level schedules.\nThe Biden reelection campaign got a shot across the bow then. The president of the United Auto Workers Union announced the UAW had decided to place a hold on an endorsement of reelecting Biden citing their concerns with the aggressive schedule for a transition to all electric vehicles.\nIn public comments, that the UAW filed regarding the proposed rule, they pressed the Biden administration to relax the compliance timeline. In discussions with senior White House officials, they repeated that request. Following those discussions, Biden administration officials said the union's comments had \"resonated.\"\nBeyond the threat of the UAW to withhold an endorsement, other comments that likely resonated with the Biden reelection campaign was an observation by University of Michigan political science professor Barry Rabe.\nSpeaking on Michigan politics and Donald Trump, Rabe said, \"Mr. Trump has focused on the anxiety over electric vehicles that pervades that auto-making state, one of a handful of swing states where the election is likely to be decided. Whenever he [Trump] comes to the state, this comes up. And this is not abstract in Michigan, it's a real question.\"\nBy early January of this year, the EPA sent a revised version of its auto emissions limits to the White House. It included the longer time frame requested by the UAW. Weeks later, the United Auto Workers endorsed Biden.\nHistorically the UAW has been a major political force in Michigan. Despite a diminished membership, their endorsement will help them in energizing and mobilizing their members in get-out-the-vote initiatives for Biden in November.\nIf that happens, it will further affirm that the Biden administration has ramped up a \"pedal to the metal\" campaign mode regarding public policy issues that impact voters in a handful of key battleground states such as Michigan.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A plea for aid to Ukraine from a World War II refugee\n\n March 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RITA ZELTINS HEACOCK | Section: Columns \n \n 972\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I write this history of my family's escape from the horror of life under the Russians during the early 1940s because I feel deeply that Ukraine under the Russians would be tragic. My story begins when I was a little girl in Latvia.It must have been a traumatic experience in 1944 for my parents, Janis (John) Zeltins, 38, and Alma Asaris Zeltins, 36, to pack what they could carry and with four children, Zigrida Emilija, 12; Rita Olga, 9; Eriks, 5; and Benita Lidija, 1, in tow, to start a journey with destination unknown from their native country, Latvia. It is truly said that the fear of the unknown is really great, but in this case, the fear of the known was greater than the fear of the unknown.\nTo fully understand this what might seem like a \"foolhardy\" decision, some background is in order.\nAt that time Latvia suffered under communist dictator Stalin's ruthless domination. Our father being a Baptist minister was scrutinized as to his activities and reported to the Russian government during their occupation. Many people during this time mysteriously vanished, especially people with influence such as teachers, clergy and other community leaders. Some were killed outright but many were deported to Siberia for hard labor.\nFamilies were sometimes separated; children were taken from their parents for indoctrination into the Russian dogma. Our family had been on the list to be deported but fortunately we were able to escape this fate. As a matter of fact, knowing what occupation under the Russian regime was like, one million (half of Latvia's inhabitants) left the country. To this day, you can find Latvians in every part of the world as a result of World War II and the Russian occupation.\nMy family was very fortunate to be able to board a train heading toward Germany. Since we were not Jews, Germany was relatively safe for us, although trains were a risky form of transportation during a war. They were used to transport supplies and troops to the fighting armies, so we were in danger of being bombed by both the Russian and American air forces.\nWhen airplanes were detected, the train was stopped, all got off and laid in ditches or fields in case the train was bombed. If we happened to be near or in a potato field, we'd be assured of dinner. So we continued until we reached Germany. Germany was inundated with refugees from every country bordering Russia. It was a mass exodus.\nWe traveled, by whatever means possible, farther and farther west. At one point, we were put up at a large well-to-do farm that needed farm hands since all the able-bodied German men were serving in their army. Now our father had steady work and ample food for the family. Our mother was able to work in the garden as well. We had a small apartment on top of the animal barn. The heat generated by the animals and feather down blankets kept us warm.\nThe end of the war came suddenly. One day, the American army arrived at the edge of the village, and before entering, they discharged some tank artillery down the street to see if anyone would shoot back. None did.\nThe American troops peacefully occupied the village by slowly passing through the street in their tanks. People cautiously came out of their houses and greeted the Americans. We were happy and finally felt safe.\nThe hope was that we'd be able to go back home soon. That hope was short lived. It seemed that Germany was to be divided among the Allies and whatever else was occupied by Russians would become status quo. That meant that Latvia would remain under Russian domination and the area where we were in Germany would become part of the Russian zone. Our journey, once again, had to continue toward the unknown, as far away from the Russians as possible.\nThis turned into a trek by foot on the German autobahn, dragging our belongings in a small farm wagon, with Benita and Eriks perched atop our \"riches.\" While our parents pulled the wagon, Rita and Zigrida trailed behind. We shared the autobahn with the American troops as they moved west toward what was to be the American zone of Germany. So, if we were going in the same direction as the Americans, we should end up in the same place.\nWhen the American troops saw the sight of us walking, some of them generously threw some oranges and chocolate bars to us. I remember that sometimes we also got rides in American army trucks or jeeps. So we continued until we arrived in Hanau, a city near Frankfurt which was definitely in the American zone of Germany. So we sighed a sigh of relief that we had arrived at a safe place.\nHousing for displaced people in Germany was the next step in our lives, and from there my family was fortunate to be welcomed into a small town in Pennsylvania where my parents found work and eventually were able to send my sisters, brother and me to college.\nHow different our lives were in America than had we lived under communist rule.\nAs I think about Russia's invasion of Ukraine I am reminded of the reason my parents chose to endure a very risky journey to the unknown in order to escape Communism. Should Ukraine fall to the Russians will Latvia again in the future suffer its cruel repression? What about Poland and other neighboring countries?

I've been in spaces now and held my own,\" said Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Maryland Angela Alsobrooks.Approaching the May primaries, she is one of several candidates vying to represent Democrats in the race for the state's open senate seat.\n\"This race is not only important to the state of Maryland, but to the country,\" Alsobrooks said.\nOn Sunday, she spoke at a meet-and-greet hosted by the Democratic Club of Kent County held at Minary's Dream Alliance in Chestertown.\nHer opponent, Democrat David Trone, who has represented Maryland's 6th Congressional District in the House of Representatives since 2019, spoke at Washington College back in Dec. 7.\nAs reported by Washington College press, Trone stressed working across the aisle on issues like the opioid epidemic, drug and alcohol addiction, mental health issues, criminal justice reform, structural racism, climate crisis and education.\nAlsobrooks, a former two-term state's attorney, expressed passion for some of the same things, growing economic opportunity, investing in education and making sure people are safe.\nLike Trone, Alsobrooks encouraged reaching out to Republicans on important issues. She saw that differing perspectives are not something to run from.\nAlsobrooks brought up many bipartisan opportunities in the future and some in the past lost over partisan politics.\nIn healthcare, Republicans worked to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, she said.\nOn Economic Issues, there are infrastructure bills both can agree on, she said.\nIn poreign policy, they need people who can exercise a diplomacy-first approach.\n\"Freedom defines our way of life as Americans. America needs to be a strong leader around the world and protect our allies,\" she said.\nAlsobrooks noted Ukraine as an ally, and the need to support them against Russian President Vladimir Putin. She said Isreal is an ally that needs support as well.\nAlsobrooks wants her experience to speak for itself, but she said she is aware her history as a Black woman plays a role. If elected, she said she'll stand in the gap for rights she said are under attack, such as voting rights and LGBTQ rights.\n\"There's no women representing us. Our delegation is talented but not diverse. Of the eight congressmen and two senators, all are men. It is time to send a woman to Washington so our lived experiences are there. I believe every one of us should look at the State and see ourselves. Every race, gender, background, socioeconomic level, makes us stronger if all of us are represented.\"\nAlsobrooks went on to address former Governor, Republican Larry Hogan, who announced his intentions to run for Senate seat on Feb.9.\nSome pundits have speculated if he wins the Republican primary, that would force Democrats to divert resources usually spent in other states.\nHogan, who Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said was the \"get of the year,\" as put by Alsobrooks, would help Republicans gain a majority in the Senate.\nSenior Adviser of her campaign David Sloan pointed out that Kent County went blue for former president Barack Obama in 2008.\n\"On May 14, this county's going green for Angela Alsobrooks,\" he said.\nAlsobrooks said, \"I can really make a difference to our state. In a body that needs a difference-maker I can shake loose some of the gridlock in Washington.\"\nAlsobrooks' next stop was in Easton, capping off her Eastern Shore visit. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trump comes out against TikTok ban; Biden backs social media prohibition\n\n March 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Belgrade News | Section: National \n \n 927\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Former U.S. president Donald Trump has come out against banning TikTok arguing restricting the popular social media app will overly benefit Meta-owned platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.\"If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!,\" Trump said in a social media post on Truth Social, referring to Facebook founder and Meta chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\nTrump continues to contest the 2020 election, arguing President Joe Biden's victory was rigged. He also faults social media platforms for restrictions on his accounts and other conservatives.\nTrump's opposition to a TikTok ban comes amidst an aggresive congressional push from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers to prohibit the platform in the U.S. if the social media firm does not separate from its Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd.\nByteDance is based in Beijing.\nBIDEN BACKS BAN\nBiden backs the federal TikTok ban. \"If they pass it, I'll sign it,\" Biden told reporters Friday, according to the Associated Press.\nTrump's TikTok stance also comes as the state of Montana defends challenges to its own statewide ban of the social media site and app. Others states are also pushing TikTok prohibitions and the Montana case could determine those and the federal ban's fates.\nMontana Gov. Greg Gianforte, Attorney General Austin Knudsen, both Republicans, support the ban which was sponsored by State Sen. Shelley Vance, R-Belgrade. The Montana law is being challenged on free speech grounds in federal court.\nTrump's stance puts him at odds with a number of other GOP lawmakers and on the same side of the issue as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other free speech advocates.\nThey contend federal and state bans of TikTok— which features short-form videos from users — are censorship and violate the First Amendment.\nIn a statement, the ACLU said TikTok prohibitions would \"silence the millions of people across the country who use the app to access information, express themselves, and speak out on the issues that matter to them.\"\nU.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, is also opposed to the federal TikTok ban.\n\"Next week, the House will vote to give Biden the power to decide which apps you can run on your phone, based on whether he deems them to be owned by a foreign adversary. I've never used TikTok, but I'm not voting to give the President new powers to ban it and other apps,\" Massie said.\n'COMMUNIST CHINESE MALWARE'\nBackers of TikTok restrictions worry about the app's Chinese ownership and data collection on U.S. users and whether it abides by consumer protection laws. They also argue TikTok's Chinese ownership poses a national security threat.\n\"This is my message to TikTok: break up with the Chinese Communist Party or lose access to your American users,\" said U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisconsin, a prime proponent of the bill. \"America's foremost adversary has no business controlling a dominant media platform in the United States. TikTok's time in the United States is over unless it ends its relationship with CCP-controlled ByteDance. So long as it is owned by ByteDance and thus required to collaborate with the CCP, TikTok poses critical threats to our national security.\"\nOther bill sponsors agree and the issue puts some GOP lawmakers in concurrence with Biden.\n\"TikTok is Communist Chinese malware that is poisoning the minds of our next generation and giving the CCP unfettered access to troves of Americans' data,\" said U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-New York. She is also chair of the House Republican Conference and has been mentioned as a 2024 Trump running mate.\nBut there are also Democratic backers of the national ban if TikTok does not separate from its Chinese parent.\n\"Congress can no longer afford to ignore the growing threat posed by foreign adversary-controlled applications like TikTok,\" said Rep.Ritchie Torres, D-New York. \"TikTok not only jeopardizes our national security but also threaten our fundamental freedoms by allowing adversaries to surveil and influence the American public under the guise of a social media platform\nFIGHT FOR MARKET SHARE\nTikTok has been urging its 170 million U.S. users to flood lawmakers with calls and emails opposing the bank\n\"This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States. The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression. This will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience, and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country.\" the company said in a statement.\nTikTok has 1.56 billion users globally that puts it behind only Facebook 3.05 billion, YouTube 2.49 billion, WhatsApp 2 billion and Instagram 2 billion, according to research portal Statista.\nTikTok has been gaining market share especially among younger social media users.\nU.S. social media platforms have been building up their lobbying and campaign contributions muscles in recent years as they face scrutiny over antitrust concerns and try to stave off other pushes to restrict content and social media access by minors. They also stand to gain if TikTok is out of the U.S. social media picture.\nMeta — which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram— spent more than $78.2 million on federal lobbying between 2020 and 2023, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nMeta donated more than $10.95 million to federal candidates during the last three election cycles (2020, 2022 and so far in 2024), according to the watchdog group.\nAlphabet — which owns Google and YouTube — spent $62.7 million on federal lobbying from 2020 to 2023 and donated $46.9 million to federal campaigns during the last three cycles.\nByteDance spent $25.9 million on lobbying during the same time frame and $174,802 on campaign contributions. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Why are so many Republicans silent about Putin?",
    "date": "2024-03-09",

    "content": "Why are so many Republicans silent about Putin?\n\n March 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 673\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last week, hundreds of thousands of Russians citizens risked arrest and congregated on city streets across Russia to pay their last respects to Alexei Navalny. Aged 47, a lawyer and true hero of Russia, he led the opposition to Vladmir Putin from in and out of prison for the last 10 years. He died of unknown causes in a prison camp north of the Arctic Circle where he spent 300 out of the last 365 days in solitary confinement.His opposition party is Russia of the future.\nIn his first retribution against Navalny, Putin tried to assassinate Navalny in 2020 on a flight back to Moscow from Siberia. Putin's henchmen spritzed a banned nerve agent on Navalny's underwear. He was taken off the plane in a coma near death to a hospital in Siberia. Navalny's wife Yulia publicly pleaded with Putin to allow Navalny supporters to take him by chartered plane to a hospital in Germany where he recovered after a year of treatment. Yet he made the courageous decision to return to Moscow to lead his opposition party. Putin had him arrested when the plane landed in Russia and sent to prison, never to leave alive.\nMany other critics of Putin met with mysterious deaths. Alexander Litvinenko, a former member of Russian intelligence who defected to the United Kingdom, died there of polonium poisoning in 2006.\nYevgeny Prigozhin, a former friend of Putin and head of the Wagner paramilitary group, died when his private plane exploded midair last year after Prigozhin revolted with his troops against the conduct of the war in Ukraine.\nBoris Nemtsov was an opposition leader and deputy prime minister under the previous Yeltzin government. After the secret police shadowed Nemtsov for more than a year, he died in 2015 when Putin's agents shot Nemtsov four times in the back.\nAnna Politkovskaya, one of Russia's most prominent journalists and a Putin critic, was shot in her home in 2006. In addition, half a dozen prominent businessmen who went into exile in the UK were found dead under suspicious circumstances.\nFinally, Sergei Magnitsky, a tax lawyer exposed Putin's corrupt seizure of $230 million in taxes paid by Magnitsky's client, Bill Browder. Magnitsky was incarcerated and beaten to death in 2009. Browder, a successful money manager in Russia, was exiled by Putin to the United Kingdom and consequently became an activist against Putin.\nWith the help of Sens. McCain and Cardin, Browder encouraged Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act, which became law in 2012. It authorizes the U.S. government to freeze the assets of human rights offenders, those engaged in official corruption, and to forbid them from entering the U.S. Other nations passed similar laws. Putin issued death threats against Bill Browder.\nPutin also has had Americans imprisoned in Russia for made-up crimes. Evan Gershkovich, the young foreign correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, was arrested in March 2023 and incarcerated ever since.\nPutin's rise to power is telling. He was a Soviet Communist KGB agent for 16 years, stationed in Berlin, who spied on the West until 1991. He became the chief of staff to the Mayor of St. Petersburg, and then Boris Yeltsin, first president of the Russian Federation, appointed Putin prime minister. Yeltsin, drowning in alcohol, resigned the following year, and Putin became president. Since 2000, Putin suspended legitimate elections, declared himself president for life, and imprisoned or killed his opposition leaders.\nPutin wants to recreate the \"greater Russia\" of the Tsars by seizing the territory of old Russia, including Ukraine.\nThe question is, why does Donald Trump so admire and refuse to condemn Putin despite his outrageous crimes against Ukraine and his political opponents? Perhaps Trump, who fancies himself the master of revenge (\"I am your retribution\") against his perceived enemies, envies Putin's record of unchecked, ruthless retribution against his opponents.\nThere may be other dark explanations, such as the expectation that Putin will once again interfere in the presidential election. History will tell. Inexplicably, why are many in the GOP similarly silent about Putin?\nLena Gill lives in Easton and is a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "I made up my mind; don't confuse me with facts\n\n March 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 654\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In every election cycle there are political pundits who use their position on media outlets as a bully pulpit to share their opinions. One of them is Claire McCaskill, a \"political analyst\" for MSNBC.Prior to joining MSNBC, McCaskill was a career politician and U.S. senator from Missouri who lost her reelection bid in 2018. After accepting her new role at MSNBC, McCaskill said she would \"not hold back.\"\nShe also could have said, but chose not to say — \"in my new role, I will not forget losing my Senate race to a candidate endorsed by Donald Trump.\"\nThat was confirmed by her comments last week in an appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe. During her appearance, McCaskill had an epic on-air meltdown over a fact-checking article on Joe Biden in The New York Times.\nThe article's headline was \"Fact-Checking Biden's Recent Economic Talking Points.\" In the article, The Time's reporters concluded some of Biden's statements were either lacking context, misleading or outright false.\nIn reacting to the story, McCaskill said, \"Can I make a suggestion? I move that every newspaper in America quits doing any fact-checks on Joe Biden until they fact-check Donald Trump every morning on the front page. It is ridiculous that The New York Times fact-checked Joe Biden on something. I mean, he vomits lies, Trump vomits lies. Every day, over and over and over again.\"\nShe went on to say, \"And it's just ridiculous that the New York Times is doing a fact-check on Biden, while they let Trump, like they're numb to the torrent of lies coming out of Trump's mouth.\"\nIn her rant, McCaskill never refuted the conclusions in the Times article.\nRegarding fact-checking fairness, McCaskill needs to recognize three facts that she is either unaware of or unwilling to acknowledge.\nFact No. 1: Her claim that Donald Trump has not been routinely subjected to rigorous fact checking is simply not true.\nPolitiFact, a nonpartisan fact-checking website launched by the Tampa Bay Times, and now owned by The Poynter Institute (a nonprofit learning center for journalists), has regularly tracked Trump campaigns and White House years.\nTheir website notes that Trump has been fact-checked thousands of times by different news organizations since he entered politics.\nAfter Trump, the three most-fact-checked politicians were former President Obama with 603 fact-checks, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton with 301 fact-checks, and President Biden with 286 fact checks.\nProgressive national media outlets like the New York Times and Washington Post are not cheerleaders or apologists for Trump.\nFact No. 2: On its website PolitiFact reports \"The Washington Post's Fact-checker column sought to collect every statement by Trump during his one term as president. They ended up with 30,753 items.\"\nFact No. 3: New York Times Publisher, A.G. Sulzberger responded to McCaskill's attack by acknowledging the White House has been \"extremely upset\" over its coverage of Biden. He then said, \"We are just stating the truth fully and plainly, but we are also doing that in a way that is unemotional. We are not anyone's opposition, and we're not anyone's lap dog.\"\nIn her tirade, Clair McCaskill asked, \"May I make a motion?\" Without waiting for an answer, she plowed ahead with her suggestion that \"every newspaper in America quit doing any fact-checks on Joe Biden until they fact-check Donald Trump every morning on the front page.\"\nI have a motion too. I suggest every American ignore self-absorbed talking head pundits who are often wrong but never in doubt. This is especially the case with former elected and appointed politicians desperately trying to be important and relevant without interest in or capability of vetting their opinions.\nVoters are best served with knowledgeable researchers' fact-checking every candidate, elected official, and high-level appointed official without regard to their party affiliation or issue positions. Voters also are best served with knowledgeable journalists choosing the best media outlets to share the fact-checking results.\nThat is what the voting public needs and deserves.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "U.S. troops, ships head to Gaza to build aid port in Israel-Hamas war zone\n\n March 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: News \n \n 902\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n U.S. troops and ships are headed to Gaza to build a pier and new causeway to supply aid to Palestinians in the Holy Land war zone.Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday that U.S. ships have left Virginia to head to Gaza.\nU.S. troops and engineers will build a floating pier and 1,800-foot causeway in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Gaza to deliver food, water and other aid to Palestinians in the densely populated area at the center of the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\"We expect the pier to be fully operational in approximately 60 days which will be able to facilitate the delivery of about 2 million meals per day,\" Ryder said.On March 8, Ryder said the U.S. was still figuring out security for the causeway and pier and how to protect U.S. troops and ships in the war zone.\nClose to 33,000 Palestinians (including militants and civilians) have died in the war and close to 1,500 Israelis have been killed (including soldiers and civilians targeted on Oct 7), according to authorities on both sides fo the Middle East conflict.\nThe U.S. move to build a Gaza aid port comes as President Joe Biden faces international pressure and internal political political pressure from many progressive voters to push Israel to agree to a ceasefire and relent its attacks against Hamas in Gaza and a promised Ramadan offensive against the Islamic militant group.\nU.S. progressives have heckled Biden at campaign and other events over his support for Israel and the war. Some anti-war and pro-Palestinian Democratic voters have withheld support from Biden in Democratic primaries. In Michigan, 18.9% of primary voters supported another candidate or voted \"uncommitted.\" That number was 29.4% in Minnesota, 27% in Oklahoma and 17.4% in Colorado.\nBiden has referred to himself as a Zionist (backing a Jewish state in Israel) on several occasions (including at the White House Hanukkah celebration last year) Biden has received more than $10 million in campaign contributions from pro-Israeli groups during his more than 50 years in national politics, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nSome progressives — including U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon — argue the U.S. is complicit in the civilian deaths among Palestinians.\n\"We have the ability to get aid onshore with our huge sealift and airlift capability and then have it distributed by humanitarian organizations. We are complicit now in the starvation and humanitarian catastrophe because of our close relationship, and this has to end. We have to act directly,\" said Merkley in an interview with Democracy Now, pressing for a ceasefire and faulting Israel for not allowing more aid into Gaza.\nOn the right, U.S, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, worries about security at a U.S. aid port in Hamas-controlled Gaza and who will end up distributing the supplies.\n\"It's theater. Just like the airdrops last week, it's not designed to solve anything. It's designed to basically appease that element of his base that is screaming at them about genocide and demanding ceasefire and all that other pro-Hamas stuff,\" Rubio told Fox Business, referring to recent U.S. air drops of foods and supplies.\nRubio worries about the moves resulting in U.S. \"boots on the ground.\"\n\"You're going to need them. You'll need someone on the ground to protect you while you're actually putting up all the things that you need to put up, through the Army Corps and other [entities], to build a temporary port,\" the Florida Republican continued.\n\"Once you get aid in, who's going to distribute it? The only people on the ground with any organization to distribute things are Hamas. We're going to go through all this trouble and put American lives on the line just so aid can be distributed to Hamas, who, in turn, will then control it, like they've controlled everything. There's no Hamas fighters starving to death, and Hamas has no history, none whatsoever, of helping civilians.\"\nRubio prefers letting Israel finish off Hamas.\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris have stepped up their support for a ceasefire with the U.S. president seeing the need for a \"come to Jesus\" conversation about the war with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nNetanyahu has vowed to continue the war against Hamas after the Oct. 7 terror attacks and the Palestinian group's refusal to release Israeli hostages. Eight of those hostages have dual American-Israeli citizenship.\n\"We will destroy Hamas, free our hostages and ensure that Gaza doesn't ever pose a threat to Israel again,\" Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday, promising to move ahead with an offensive against Hamas in the Rafah area of Gaza.\nNetanyahu said he appreciates support from the U.S. and Biden, a longtime backer of Israel \"and I hope it will continue. Israel gets $3 billion annually in defense aid from the U.S. and has received additional weapons shipments since the war started.\n\"\"But let me be clear, Israel will win this war no matter what,\" the Israeli prime minister said.\nWhile Hamas has refused to release remaining hostages and neighboring countries such as Egypt and Jordan refuse to take in Palestinian refugees, hard-right factions in Israel continue to press for an eradication of Islamic militants and Gaza and for removals of Palestinians.\nThe U.S. — which provides Israel with weapons and munitions and has vetoed United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for a ceasefire — has had naval, intelligence, surveillance and special forces in the war zone to help Israel Defense Forces and to dissuade Iran and others from entering the fray. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A line in the video, spoken by a behavioral therapist as I recall, was, \"If you always do what you've always done you'll always get what you've always gotten.\"\nI've never forgotten that statement because, in simple truth, it means that there must be consequences for all actions. Positive consequences to poor behavior, if repeated, need to change in order for the poor behavior to change.\nMr. Donald Trump, one of the established candidates for the office of POTUS at the age of 77, is just beginning to realize negative consequences for a lifetime of poor and self-serving behaviors. Is it too late to change this man's behavior? I think it is. Is it too late for voters to see the consequences for our country and the citizens who call the USA home if Mr. Trump is elected for another term? I think not.\nI do know that our democratic republic and all of the cultural and social gains we've made on this continent over the last 200 years, will be lost if this neurotic egotist becomes president again.\nVICKI SPARKS\nFishing Creek \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

My understanding is that Congress authorized veterans of United States of America's military service to render this traditional gesture of honor and respect, even while wearing civilian attire.\nI do not believe this Congressional authorization was extended to those who did not serve in U.S. military or uniformed services. It certainly was not intended to grant special recognition or privilege to those who purposefully evaded that responsibility of service, at a time when for most young males in America, it was a normal expectation of growing up.\nPure and simple, Donald Trump is a deliberate and loathsome draft dodger.\nI hope that all veterans can recall, with some measure of pride, their willingness to serve, and that they never forget the friends and family lost to them while fulfilling that responsibility of service.\nDonald Trump thought only of Donald Trump when he was called upon to serve. By his own words, he sees those of us who did serve and the many who died as \"suckers\" and asked, \"What was in it for them?\" I believe he failed a major test of loyalty, leadership and service and is not worthy of my vote.

    "content": "Biden administration ready to release federal funds for Baltimore bridge\n\n March 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: YESENIA MONTENEGRO Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 935\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is prepared to provide federal funding to cover costs following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Wednesday in a White House press briefing.\"We are committed to delivering every federal resource needed to help Maryland get back to normal and we're going to work with them every step of the way to rebuild this bridge,\" Buttigieg said.\nWhile there is no estimate on the cost of rebuilding yet, there are provisions in place that allow funds to be released while the estimate is being determined. The Maryland Department of Transportation has released an emergency relief funding request, which will be processed immediately to start the funding process, Buttigieg said.\nThe infrastructure law authorized funding of the emergency relief account, which will most likely be used in this situation. According to Buttigieg, about $950 million is available. However, this money is used for other projects as well, so it is likely that Congress will be asked to authorize additional funding.\n\"That shouldn't be a barrier to the immediate next few days beginning to get the ball rolling,\" he said.\nPresident Joe Biden met earlier in the Oval Office with Buttigieg and U.S. Coast Guard Vice Admiral Peter Gautier. The president also spoke by phone with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Lt. Gen. Scott Spellmon, chief of engineers and commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\"The people of Baltimore can count on us to stick with them at every step of the way until the port is reopened and Francis Scott Key Bridge is rebuilt,\" Biden said in a post on X. \"We're not leaving until it's done.\"\nButtigieg said officials did not have an estimate yet of costs to replace the bridge. He also declined to estimate how long it will take to reopen the Port of Baltimore.\nAny private party found accountable for the accident will be held responsible, Buttigieg said. However, Biden's goal is not to have that process interfere with Maryland getting the financial help it needs, he said.\nButtigieg said it was \"possible if not likely\" the administration will ask Congress for additional money to refill the emergency relief account.\nHe said he hopes that some Republicans will work with Biden and Democrats to provide that funding. He also reminded members of Congress on the fence about supporting federal funding to remember that \"today this is happening in Baltimore, tomorrow it could be your district.\"\n\"Infrastructure is, or at least ought to be, a bipartisan priority,\" the secretary said. \"I know that partisanship has gotten in the way of some important functions and expenditures, but I would also note that the infrastructure package that was passed is known as the bipartisan infrastructure law for a reason.\"\n\"I think in a situation like this where you have a national emergency where it's gonna attract a lot of attention, I think it's gonna get through rather quickly,\" John Dedie, a political science professor at the Community College of Baltimore County told Capital News Service. \"There are gonna be some people that may grumble in the House a little bit, but I think that under the circumstances people are gonna realize economically something has to be done to build this thing.\"\nButtigieg said the Department of Transportation will focus on reopening the port, dealing with supply chain implications until the port reopens, rebuilding the bridge and dealing with surface transportation implications until the bridge can be rebuilt.\n\"The products that are now stuck behind the blocked channel are one piece of it, and that affects global markets everywhere,\" Maryland Sen. Sarah Elfreth, a Democrat who currently serves on the state's Budget and Taxation Committee, told CNS. \"Not to mention what can't come into the port for the time it takes to clear the channel.\"\nAbout 8,000 jobs are directly affected and between $100 million-$200 million worth of cargo moves in and out of the port every day, according to Buttigieg.\n\"Rebuilding will not be quick, or easy or cheap, but we will get it done,\" he said.\nThe accident investigation is led by the National Transportation Safety Board. The Coast Guard will also be providing investigators with its Marine Board of Investigation, which is one of the highest levels of investigation within the Coast Guard, Gautier said during the press conference.\nThe greatest immediate challenge, the vice admiral said, is going to be the removal of the bridge trusses now draped across the bow of the cargo ship. The bow of the vessel Dali currently is sitting on the bottom of the Patapsco River but there are no signs that the hull is leaking.\n\"What we do know is a bridge like this one, completed in the 1970s, was simply not made to withstand a direct impact on a critical support pier, from a vessel that weighs about 200 million pounds,\" Buttigieg said.\nAlthough there is no timeline yet, Buttigieg expects that the clearing of the channel will happen on a much quicker timeline than the reconstruction of the bridge. The Army Corps of Engineers is beginning the underwater surveys to understand the possible challenges the debris presents, Gautier said.\nThe State of Maryland is simultaneously conducting body recovery operations in and around the same area as the debris assessment, Gautier said. Six highway workers who were on the bridge at the time of the accident are missing and presumed dead.\nBiden plans to visit Baltimore as soon as possible, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. The Biden administration will work with local officials to ensure that a presidential visit would not disrupt the efforts at the scene.\nCapital News Service Washington Bureau reporter Torrence Banks contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It won't be favorable in some of these areas,\" said Brandon Buckingham, a meteorologist for AccuWeather.\nBuckingham said parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas — which are attracting scores of eclipse viewers because of their propensity for clearer skies — might see clouds and storms during the eclipse.\nAreas of northern Ohio in the eclipse path are also expecting surges of visitors. They could also see some cloudy conditions.\n\"It's kind of a blend of clouds and sun,\" said Buckingham of the Monday forecast for northern Ohio.\nStill, the eclipse could be visible through cloudy conditions depending on the types of clouds as well as their prevalence and depth.\nThe weather dynamics would send eclipse tourists and the scores of astronomers and researchers driving to destinations with clearer skies. That could add to the already expected traffic congestion dynamics expected on Monday.\nBuckingham, who is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, plans on driving to view the eclipse. He's still figuring out the best place to view the solar eclipse in its totality.\n\"It's one of those game-time decisions,\" he said.\nBEST PLACES TO VIEW\nMarc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the eclipse forecast is still developing. There's a cold front moving eastward across the U.S. and storms and clouds being fostered in the Gulf of Mexico that will head west.\n\"Right now, it's still a bit uncertain,\" Chenard said, of where, when and how many clouds might be in the skies during the afternoon eclipse.\nHe said the most clear areas to view the eclipse in the totality path could be in northern parts of Arkansas, southeastern Missouri, southern Illinois and southern Indiana.\nHe said parts of New England and Canada could also be clear, but the eclipse viewing in places such as Ohio could depend on the amount and depth of cloud cover.\nMid-Atlantic areas could see a mix bag for viewing with partly cloudy conditions forecasted for Easton, Ocean City and other parts of the Eastern Shore for Monday — the day of the eclipse.\nChenard said areas in Texas could also be \"a game-time decision\" in terms of eclipse visibility with clear skies expected in western areas of the state and more cloudy weather and storms to the east.\n\"It really could go either way,\" said Chenard, who will be visiting Texas for the eclipse.\nIn other parts of the U.S, the moon will partially block out the sun Monday afternoon.\nBuckingham said Southern California as well as central parts of the state and the Southwest could have good viewing weather while parts of the Mountain West (including Montana and Wyoming) and upper Midwest could see overcast conditions.\nGulf coast areas of Louisiana and Mississippi could see rain and clouds while the big cities of east coast such as New York, Boston and Washington D.C. could see some clouds generally decent eclipse viewing weather\nChenard said the Central Plains, Texas and Oklahoma panhandles along with Georgia and Florida can expect clear skies for the celestial event.\n\"The Southeast looks pretty good,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The curiosities extend to clues or indicators of biblical End Times or other prophecies — including the Rapture, Tribulation and Judgment Day referenced in the Book of Revelation.\nSpiritual interests in eclipses are not new, according to theologians.\n\"Throughout human history people have tried to explain and get a degree of control over things that make us feel very small and out of control,\" said Erik Thoennes, a professor of theology at Biola University, a private Evangelical college near Los Angeles.\n\"Cataclysmic events like an eclipse are awesome and can be scary to people, so all cultures have tried to interpret events like this through religious and spiritual lenses,\" he said.\nEvents like the April 8 eclipse have spiritual significance across cultures and faiths. Chinese folklore recommends banging pots and pans or making other noises to make an eclipse — which symbolizes a dragon eating the sun — go away. \"It has never failed,\" Thoennes joked.\nThe focus on events such as a total eclipse and its potential \"End of Days\" and Armageddon scenarios are especially prevalent among some Christians.\nThoennes said there are nine references in the Bible of the darkening of the sun with ties to \"divine judgment.\" That includes when Jesus died on the cross on Good Friday. \"And the sun was darkened\" reads the Gospel of Luke's account of the crucifixion.\n\"Unlike some religions that have a cyclical view of time, the biblical view is linear and is heading to a day when God brings his kingdom once and for all and judges people for how we lived our lives, especially in relation to Him,\" Thoennes said.\n\"The end of human history on Judgment Day is described in the Bible with dramatic and apocalyptic imagery which includes awesome effects on the natural order. These events include the sun going dark which is why people think about these end time events when there is an eclipse,\" he said, stressing the importance of enjoying the eclipse as a wonder of creation.\nDave Robbins, vice president of content for End Time Ministries (a Texas-based Pentecostal group), does not expect anything spiritual will happen \"during or after the eclipse\", pointing to Old Testament scripture saying \"be not dismayed at the signs of heaven.\"\n\"The Bible does say there will be signs in the sky, but we are not to use them to predict future events,\" Robbins said.\nRAPTURE, ROCKETS & WEDDINGS\nBut that is not stopping plenty of others from trying to read the tea leaves and connect the spiritual or metaphysical dots related to the eclipse.\nThe war in the Holy Land between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is helping stoke some of that interest in the Second Coming and prophecies across the Abrahamic faiths.\nSocial media theories focus on the April 8 eclipse and previous Oct. 2023 eclipse both crossing in an area of southern Illinois named Rapture.\nThere is also plenty of interest in the restarting of the Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator operated by the European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN) on eclipse day.\nNASA is also launching three sounding rockets from Wallops Island on Virginia's Eastern Shore on April 8 \"to study how Earth's upper atmosphere is affected when sunlight momentarily dims over a portion of the planet,\" according to the U.S. space agency.\nThe three rockets will be launched in 45 minute intervals before, during and after the eclipse and follow up on similar launches during an eclipse in October 2023.\nAstrologers are also zeroing in on the eclipse along with other planetary events tying them to current and expected world events. A number of astrologers and End Times prognosticators did not respond to requests for comment about what they are expecting for the eclipse.\nOthers are taking the plunge — literally on eclipse day.\nThe Total Eclipse of the Heart Music Festival in Russellville, Arkansas is in the path of totality for the eclipse that cuts across North America.\nThe music fest is hosting a mass wedding on April 8 along with other events including a worship service on Sunday.\nEvent organizer Rodney Williams said there will be approximately 5,000 people at the three-day festival and 331 couples have signed for the free Elope at the Eclipse event.\n\"We have a lot going on,\" Williams said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "U.S.: ‘Ukraine will become a member of NATO’\n\n April 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: World \n \n 845\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Ukraine will become a full-fledged member of NATO — a move that could present even more direct confrontations with Russia which invaded its Eastern European neighbor in 2022.\"Ukraine will become a member of NATO,\" Blinken said in remarks April 4 in Brussels with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba. \"Our purpose of the summit is to help build a bridge to that membership and to create a clear pathway for Ukraine moving forward.\"\nNATO has 32 members and was formed by the U.S., United Kingdom and their Western allies after World War II to counter the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact acolytes.\nThe North Atlantic alliance — which also includes Spain, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Turkey and Canada — has expanded into Eastern Europe, the Baltic states and Balkans after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nThat includes Poland, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Estonia. Previously neutral Finland and Sweden have joined the U.S.-led alliance since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nArticle 5 of NATO's treaty considers an attack on one NATO member and attack and all and would be responded to militarily. That could potentially set up more direct U.S. and NATO confrontations with Russia if its aggression against Ukraine continues.\nUkraine has been pressing for membership into NATO as well as the European Union economic alliance.\nBlinken said the recent meetings in Brussels aimed to reinforce U.S. and Western support for Ukraine in the war with Russia and move forward the process.\n\"We reaffirmed that Ukraine's future is in NATO. Our goal now is to create a bridge to Ukraine's full membership, offering additional support and greater cooperation, as Ukraine makes the reforms necessary to join the alliance,\" Blinken said in separate remarks to the press April 4.\nREGIONAL SUPPORT\nThe pronouncement comes as House Republicans hinder more U.S. military aid to Ukraine. They want more money and stringent controls on the southern border to address migrant surges.\nThe U.S. has directed $75 billion to Ukraine during the war, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and Council on Foreign Relations. U.S. President Joe Biden wants $60.7 billion from Congress for the war efforts along with military funding for Israel.\nThat has backing from Democrats — including those representing the Delmarva Peninsula — as well as from neoconservative Republicans who favor more globalist U.S. foreign policies.\n\"If Ukraine falls, Putin will move on to NATO allies in Europe and further threaten our freedom and democracy. Defending Ukraine is defending America. We must prove to our allies and partners that we are still the 'indispensable nation' and remain the leaders of the free world, or we risk further emboldening our adversaries,\" said U.S. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, in a February statement.\nU.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D- Maryland, agrees.\n\"The stakes could not be higher, which is why the United States must continue to stand with the people of Ukraine in their campaign to protect their democracy and the territorial integrity of their country. And Ukraine needs our help right now, as they are running dangerously low on ammunition and other vital supplies,\" Van Hollen said in a statement.\nFormer Maryland governor and 2024 U.S. Senate candidate Larry Hogan, a Republican, also backs U.S. support for Ukraine and promised to be an ardent NATO backer.\n\"Let me be clear - In the Senate, I will support our NATO allies because that is the best way to secure peace and American strength,\" said Hogan responding to former President Donald Trump's pronouncements on the alliance.\nESCALATING TENSIONS\nU.S. support for Ukraine's potential NATO membership raised concerns from populist conservatives and progressives concerned about escalating tensions with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"Adding Ukraine to NATO is just like saying, 'Hey Russia, let's cozy up for a friendly game of global tension and see who cracks first!',\" Vivek Ramaswamy, who was a 2024 GOP presidential candidate who now backs former U.S. President Donald Trump.\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein worries about the Biden administration's push for Ukraine membership in NATO and its Article 5 protections.\n\"Blinken just said Ukraine will join NATO, putting us directly on the path to war with Russia. Biden seems determined to start WWIII and get us all killed before we can vote him out,\" Stein said in a statement.\nOfficials in Moscow — at the Kremlin and the Russian Foreign Ministry — reiterated their opposition to Ukraine entering and NATO arguing the U.S. alliance aims to isolate, confront and inflict a strategic defeat against Russia.\n\"Washington and its allies are waging a hybrid war against our country in Ukraine,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said April 2.\nBlinken counters its Putin and Russia who are the aggressors.\n\"We will do everything we can; Allies will do everything that they can to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to continue to deal with Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine, an aggression that gets worse with every passing day. And we've seen that just in the month of March with thousands of missiles, rockets, projectiles launched at Ukrainians and Ukraine's cities and towns, its electricity grid – and that continues,\" Blinken said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Second Trump presidency could cause chaos\n\n April 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Columns \n \n 821\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Donald Trump and the pro-Trump Heritage Foundation 2025 Report are candid about their plans if Trump is elected, painting an unprecedented shift from life as we know it. Talbot County will feel it.Our county will shrink faster. With 600 miles of shoreline, the Talbot County landmass is especially vulnerable to rising sea levels and major storms, such as in St. Michaels, Oxford and other Talbot waterfront towns and farms. Trump plans to abolish the EPA and once again halt U.S plans to address climate change, which would likely collapse international cooperation on the issue.\nPolls show a healthy majority of the public want the government to do more to combat climate change. Under a Trump presidency, the government will do far less. Our children and our grandchildren would inevitably live in a faster shrinking Talbot County.\nTalbot County women will lose the right to manage their reproductive health care decisions. Many women (and men) support a federal law that will codify Roe v. Wade, the court-made abortion policy that lasted for half a century until Trump's Supreme Court overturned it. If elected, Trump would surely veto any such legislation, and support a nationwide, federal abortion ban, so restrictive, so early in the pregnancy, that some women would not know they are pregnant.\nThat would override Maryland's enlightened laws on reproductive rights. In the Access Hollywood tapes, Trump explained on a hot mic how he has his way with women. Now he seeks to have his way with their reproductive rights.\nWe will see chaos in health care and social assistance, which is Talbot County's largest industry by employment. Trump has long sought to destroy the Affordable Care Act and replace it with an unstated substitute. His first Administration's biggest achievement was a 40% corporate tax cut that added over $8 trillion to our deficit. He now campaigns on tax cuts for the working class, but the Washington Post reports he is privately discussing further corporate tax cuts. This will likely necessitate cuts in Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. The House Republican Study Committee has already called for raising the retirement age to 69 for full Social Security benefits and cutting their benefits by 13%. (The Robin Hood legend in reverse.)\nIn the next pandemic, Talbot County's health would be at risk. During COVID-19, Talbot County complied with all state requirements. Last year Trump pledged, if re-elected, to \"cut federal funding to any school, college, airline or public transportation system that imposes a mask mandate or vaccine mandate.\" He will replace the leadership of the Centers for Disease Control, so they dare not disagree again with the president's medical opinions. More than a million Americans died in the last COVID-19 pandemic, but only 114 were reported in the Talbot area. In the next such crisis, Trump will determine the seriousness of the crisis and appropriate medications, just as he tried to do in his first administration with COVID (Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine).\nTrump's new import duties will spur inflation and trade wars. He seeks an immediate 10% import duty on all goods from China. How will that impact our county? Put it this way. An estimated 70-80% of Walmart products come from China. Talbot County residents, not the Chinese exporters, would pay those duties, thus inflating prices. These duties also will likely kindle trade wars, as happened with agriculture in Trump's Administration. In 2018 soybean exports to China plummeted by 75% after China retaliated against Trump's tariff barriers.\nTrump pledges mass deportations and internment camps for undocumented people in the U.S., which will affect Talbot and its available labor force. On March 17, he called them \"animals … they are not human.\" (In 2021, there were 2,530 Talbot residents who were born outside the U.S.)\nThe rule of law will give way to the rule of Trump. The protections of the Constitution and the rule of law only exist to the extent that there are judges and a Department of Justice willing to enforce those protections. Trump calls for replacing the federal civil service with Trump loyalists, and packing the courts with jurists who will do his bidding. The post-Watergate norm of Justice Department independence from White House control will end.\nTrump has pledged to prosecute his enemies and critics (\"vermin\"), \"execute\" four-star Gen. Mark Milley, and abolish MSNBC. Among Trump's prior cabinet appointments, his vice president, his attorney general, three generals, and other Trump officials resisted Trump's constitutionally suspect directives. Having seen Trump up close, they now say they won't vote for him. In selecting his next cabinet, Trump will demand absolute fealty.\nLoyalty to Trump is everything. Demonstrating that loyalty requires more than just joining the Republican Party. Ask Liz Cheney. However, if you keep your head down and are submissive to Trump, then you should be fine. (The Russians have mastered living in an autocracy for decades.)\nTalbot County citizens, choose your future and vote.\nJim Bruce lives in St. Michaels and is a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A number of astrologers and End Times prognosticators did not respond to requests for comment about what they are expecting for the eclipse.\nOthers are taking the plunge — literally on eclipse day.\nThe Total Eclipse of the Heart Music Festival in Russellville, Arkansas is in the path of totality for the eclipse that cuts across North America.\nThe music fest is hosting a mass wedding on April 8 along with other events including a worship service on Sunday.\nEvent organizer Rodney Williams said there will be approximately 5,000 people at the three-day festival and 331 couples have signed for the free Elope at the Eclipse event.\n\"We have a lot going on,\" Williams said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Republican senate candidate Larry Hogan visits Eastern Shore\n\n April 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WENDY WEITZEL wweitzel@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 537\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Former Gov. Larry Hogan spent a day on the Mid-Shore Friday, as his \"Back to Work\" bus tour came through Queen Anne's, Caroline and Talbot counties.Hogan made nine stops in the three counties, appealing to local voters in what has become a closely watched race for Maryland's open U.S. Senate seat.\nDuring a stop at Easton-based engineering firm Rauch Inc.'s 40th anniversary celebration, Hogan said his campaign had made over 70 stops throughout the state since the bus tour began this month.\nHogan, a Republican, announced his candidacy for the office in early February. A rare two-term Republican governor in Maryland, where the majority of voters are registered Democrats, Hogan said he is hoping to appeal to voters who are disenfranchised with partisan politics.\n\"A lot of people are frustrated that nothing ever seems to get done in Washington, and so I think they think I got a lot done while I was governor,\" he said. \"They think that there's too much divisiveness, and dysfunction and gridlock, but people are concerned about the economy, they're concerned about crime, they're concerned about securing the border and fixing our broken immigration system… They think that a lot of the loudest, angriest voices get all the attention, and I think they'd rather send some straight-talking, common-sense leader to try to see if they can't clean up the mess.\"\nHogan is just the latest Senate candidate to make his way to the Eastern Shore. His stiffest competition for the Senate seat, Democratic frontrunners David Trone and Angela Alsobrooks, have also made visits to Mid-Shore counties in recent months.\nTrone, who has served as a U.S. representative for Maryland's 6th Congressional District since 2019, visited Easton last week. He took a walking tour of downtown businesses led by the Easton Economic Development Corporation on April 4, according to a post by his campaign on X, formerly called Twitter. The following day, Trone posted photos from a meeting with the Talbot Democratic Women's Club.\nOn Feb. 25, Alsobrooks spoke at a meet-and-greet event hosted by the Democratic Club of Kent County at Minary's Dream Alliance in Chestertown, where she appealed to voters by emphasizing her willingness to work across the aisle and her track record of \"holding (her) own\" in politics.\nAlsobrooks served two terms as state's attorney for Prince George's County.\nAs Democrats fight to maintain their slim majority in the U.S. senate, Hogan's popularity in Maryland has raised GOP hopes of winning what has long been considered a solidly blue seat, making Maryland's Senate race one of unexpected national significance.\nRecent polling shows Hogan in a dead-heat with Alsobrooks and Trone. Results from a Goucher College and Baltimore Banner poll released last week show 44% of respondents backing Hogan and 40% backing Alsobrooks in a November matchup. In a matchup between Hogan and Trone, 43% said they backed Hogan, and 42% backed Trone. About 10% were undecided in both races, according to the poll, which has a 3.5 margin of error.\nAlsobrooks and Trone, along with eight other Democratic candidates, will face off in the May 14 primary for the seat. Hogan will face six other Republicans on May 14.\nThe winners of the primaries will face off in the November general election.\nReporter Maggie Trovato contributed to this article. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "This is what authoritarian government looks like\n\n April 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LARRY PIFER | Section: Columns \n \n 618\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Suspension of individual rights, book burning, violent behavior to those who oppose you, suspension of democratic rule, vowing eradication of an entire group of people because of their beliefs, military takeover of everyday life. These were the distinguishing characteristics of the worst authoritarian dictatorship in modern history, Nazi Germany, and in particular Adolf Hitler, their leader.It is good sometimes to remind ourselves of these facts, as they might fade from memory for some people, especially those born after 1990. These things happened in Germany and subsequently plunged the world into A war that lasted for six years and took millions of lives before the Nazis could be stopped. That is what the face of authoritarianism and dictatorship looks like.\nDonald Trump has told us if he is elected president again, he will be a dictator. He claims only for a day. But as we know Donald Trump and the truth are often at odds. Donald Trump's support and appreciation of current authoritarian governments like Vladimir Putin in Russia, Recep Erdogan in Turkey and Victor Orban in Hungry tells us what he wants as his government.\nTrump has been quoted as saying of Orban that \"he's the boss\". Our Declaration of Independence says \"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator, with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"\nAuthoritarian dictators like Hitler, Putin, Erdogan and Orban do not believe that this is or should be true. Is this what we want as the future direction of our country? I think not.\nThe similarities between Trump, what he says he will do if elected and the policies of Nazi Germany are astounding. It is as if he has read Hitler's manifesto \"Mein Kampf\" and is using it as his playbook. Why would we possibly want to allow anything like that in the United States?\nDonald Trump apparently does not understand this because he makes statements like, \"I will be a dictator but only for a short time.\" In that \"short time\" much evil could be done. If indeed it is short. We must not allow Trump anywhere near the presidency. Donald Trump has already been indicted in four separate cases. One of those cases is against our country by leading an insurrection against the peaceful transfer of power. And we all know he did that because we saw it front of us on Jan. 6, 2021.\nFinally, moving from policies to personal profiles, consider this profile:\n\"His primary rules were: never allow the public to cool off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one; and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later believe it.\"\nThis profile was written not in 2024, but during World War II in a secret report, compiled by psychologists at the request of the Office of Strategic Services. It was about Adolf Hitler.\nWhen we go to vote on Nov. 5, we must remember that Donald Trump has promised us he will be a dictator and try to form an authoritarian government that will seek to deny us our rights and privileges given to us by our constitution. He will especially target immigrants, women and minorities because he has done this before, and it continues to be a central part of his message. We must not elect Donald Trump president.\nLarry Pifer is a resident of Easton and is a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Absolute devastation': Wars, violence in Haiti, Sudan overshadowed, overlooked\n\n April 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: News \n \n 1690\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With the U.S. poised to allocate $95 billion in new war focused on Ukraine and Israel and global eyes glued to Gaza and Iran, wars, violence and worsening strife in Sudan and Haiti — two of the world's poorest countries — have been overshadowed.The violence in Haiti and Sudan includes mounting death tolls from gang, mob and paramilitary bloodshed, sexual assaults against women and girls, surges in refugees and worsening food situations.\nU.S. Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, both Maryland Democrats, and others are trying to bring attention and resolution to the violent conflicts that have ravaged Sudan in Africa and Haiti in the Caribbean.\nGANG VIOLENCE, 'MOB JUSTICE'\nA new United Nations report released Friday shows more than 2,505 people (including 82 children) were killed and more than 438 people kidnapped in Haiti's gang violence during the first quarter of 2024. The death toll is up 53% from the previous quarter.\n\"More than 4,600 inmates escaped from the two main prisons in the capital, and at least 22 police stations, sub-police stations and other police buildings were looted or set on fire, and 19 police officers were killed or injured,\" the UN report said of the anarchy also referencing gang continued use of sexual violence against women and girls.\n\"Mob justice\" incidents in Haiti killed 141 persons during the first three months of 2024. There have been an estimated 7,300 deaths in the gang wars since 2023, which have worsened since the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse in July 2021.\nThere have been more than 362,000 Haitians displaced in the violence, and the Biden administration faces criticism after it resumed deportation flights back to the ravaged island nation.\n'ABSOLUTE DEVASTATION'\nThe war in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces marked a grim one-year anniversary on April 15.\nThe conflict between rival military factions has seen more than 15,000 people killed, more than 8 million others displaced and more than 2 million refugees.\nThere have been more than 150 Christian churches damaged and destroyed, and Christians have been attacked during the paramilitary civil war in overwhelmingly Muslim Sudan, according to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.\nCardin urged additional U.S. and international aid to Sudan in comments on the Senate Floor Friday.\n\"In the last year there has been absolute devastation in Sudan. And at every turn, unarmed Sudanese have been in the crosshairs. These armed groups have committed extrajudicial killings. They have indiscriminately bombed civilian targets like hospitals that have used rape and sexual violence against woman of certain ethnic groups as a weapon of war. They have razed cities and towns, killing inhabitants, strangling commerce and trade. They have destroyed farmlands and forced farmers to leave, preventing harvests,\" Cardin said.\nHe cited a World Food Program warning that Sudan is on the verge of \"unprecedented levels of starvation.\"\nVan Hollen spoke at an April 15 event in Washington on the Sudan war hoping to generate more interest in getting humanitarian supplies and a ceasefire forged.\n\"There are lots of crises around the world that we need to address. We need to address the crisis in Sudan right now,\" Van Hollen said at the Unite for Sudan event.\n\"However we do it, we need to get more humanitarian assistance to Sudan now as we work to end the war. The best way to help people of course is to get a ceasefire and end this war and hold people accountable,\" he said.\n'WE NEED TO EXPAND THE PIE'\nThe Maryland lawmakers and relief agencies are calling for more U.S. and international humanitarian aid to Haiti and Sudan as Congress moves forward on a new $60.8 billion war assistance package for Ukraine in its war against invading Russian forces and a $26.4 billion outlay for Israel's war against Hamas and Gaza. The latter includes $9.2 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza, Sudan and other global trouble spots.\nCardin — who chairs the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee — called for increased funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.\n\"We need to expand the pie, not shrink it. Otherwise, when we try to address one crisis, we have to take money from another emergency circumstance. We should not have to choose between saving starving Sudanese or saving starving Gazans. We should not have to choose between helping Haitians or helping Ukrainians,\" Cardin said.\nThe Biden administration's FY 2025 budget calls for $42.8 billion for foreign assistance budgets for USAID and the State Department. That includes $10.3 billion for USAID humanitarian and refugee programs.\nSome baseline budget numbers for U.S. aid have been down amid partisan budget fights, but they have been bolstered by supplemental spending packages.\nThe U.S. has sent $1 billion in relief aid to Sudan since October 2023, according to the Commission on International Religious Freedom. The U.S. has moved $171 million in humanitarian funds to Haiti since October 2022. There are also questions to continue regarding the $13 billion in money raised for Haiti — including by prominent U.S. celebrities and the Clinton Foundation — after the devastating 2010 earthquake.\nThe Biden administration has already sent $75 billion to Ukraine, and Israel gets $3.3 billion annually in U.S. weapons and other military aid.\nThe Pentagon has sent additional munitions and weapons to Israel since Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks sparked the Holy Land war. The conflict has caused significant civilian casualties and dire conditions and has seen more than 13,000 and 10,000 women killed, according to the United Nations.\nThe U.S. spends close to $1 trillion on its military and national security annually.\n'WORLD'S LARGEST HUNGER CRISIS'\nU.S. Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-California) said the conflict In Sudan is \"the world's largest hunger and internal displacement crisis.\"\n\"The international community must step up to push for an end to the fighting and contribute to the grossly under-resourced humanitarian response,\" Kamlager-Dove said.\nMostly Christian South Sudan became its own country in 2011. Sudan, which has a population of more than 49 million people, is overwhelmingly Muslim.\nRosemary DiCarlo, the United Nations under-secretary-general, said the Sudan war is \"a crisis of epic proportions.\"\nIn Haiti, the situation has gone from bad to worse. Criminal gangs control much of Port-au-Prince, which has a population of more than 2.6 million.\nThe Biden administration sent a special anti-terrorism Marine Corps unit to Haiti in March to protect the U.S. Embassy.\nU.S. Army Gen. Laura Richardson, who is head of the Southern Command, said the Pentagon has a range of contingency plans related to Haiti, including a mass migration.\nRichardson told the Atlantic Council in March as of now, the U.S. doesn't have plans to send troops into Haiti but the situation needs to be addressed internationally, according to the Defense Department.\nThere are also concerns about U.S.-made guns, ammunition and other weapons making their way to Haitian gangs via smuggling and shipments into privately owned ports.\nThe U.S. has been trying to get a special police force from Kenya deployed in Haiti, but that has been delayed by the ongoing violence and the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry in March. Jimmy Chérizier, a former Haitian police officer known by the nickname \"Barbecue,\" has become a central figure in the island's crime and chaos.\nOn April 12, a Transitional Presidential Council was established to structure new elections, a new prime minister and deployment of an international police force.\nBut relief efforts have been challenging beyond the violence. A UN appeal to raise $720 million to help the situation raised 34% of that goal last year. Humanitarian groups have launched a new $674 million relief effort.\n'OUTRAGED'\nThe situation in Haiti has resulted in more refugees heading to the U.S., some via boat to Florida and others entering the U.S. and seeking asylum via the border with Mexico.\nU.S. Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, both Florida Republicans, wrote Biden last month voicing worries about the administration \"opening the floodgates\" to a mass migration from Haiti.\nOn the other side of the immigration issue, Haitian advocates and their U.S. allies slammed reports April 18 that the Biden administration had restarted flights to deport migrants.\n\"I am deeply outraged about recent reporting that the Department of Homeland Security has resumed deportations to Haiti. A country facing a political crisis of epic proportions, where basic human rights can no longer be protected, women and girls are being sexually abused on a daily basis, young boys are recruited into becoming child soldiers, over 5 million are heading towards famine, and 80% of the capital is controlled by gangs,\" said U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-Florida).\n\"The reality is that life in Haiti is currently unbearable. Deportation, under these circumstances, is simply an act of atrocious cruelty. We are either the leader of the free world who welcomes all refugees seeking safety, or we're not. I urge the Biden-Harris Administration to reverse this misguided decision and stop deportations immediately,\" she said.\nROUGH HISTORY\nThe current situation in Haiti has seen relief workers in peril, and Haiti has long been a haven for human and sex trafficking. The Dominican Republic has also fortified its border and cracked down on Haitian refugees and migrants.\nHaiti has long been the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Its history has been littered by violence, poverty, coups and corruption. The U.S. occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934 — 18 years. That came after a violent mob killed Haiti's tyrannical president in 1915 and President Woodrow Wilson sent in U.S. Marines at the behest of National City Bank of New York (which is now Citibank / Citigroup), which had taken the reins of Haiti's central bank.\nThe Caribbean nation's economic development has further been stunted by a series of payments it made to France over the years as part of its independence agreement. Haiti's debt totaled $21 billion and was financed by Citibank and French banks.\nWhile Florida, in particular Miami, and New York City have the largest Haitian populations in the U.S, Maryland's Eastern Shore and Baltimore areas are home to a number of residents of Haitian ancestry.\nNorthern Virginia, Phoenix and the Dallas-Fort Worth areas have the largest Sudanese populations in the U.S. Van Hollen said efforts to draw attention to the Sudanese conflict need to continue.\n\"We're going to need to grow our numbers. We're going to need to make sure we are calling out injustice in Sudan,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Reporting election results can get colorful\n\n April 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 728\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In November, the every four-year routine of counting votes to determine who has been elected as the U.S president will, as always, generate intense and widely followed media coverage.While much attention will be focused on the popular vote results nationwide, the most important and meaningful results are which candidate carried enough states to win in the electoral college. Accordingly, media reporting on election night will focus largely on which states went red and which states went blue.\nFor this commentary, I did a deep dive into the history on the origins, uses, and perhaps some largely forgotten practice changes over time on red and blue color labeling in the American political arena.\nThere are several thoughts on how color labels came to be used in American politics. Some suggest they came from Britain's Parliament where blue has long been associated with their right leaning political party (the Conservative Party) and red has long been associated with their left leaning political party (the Liberal Party).\nI suggest a more plausible explanation were decisions by American television networks to use color images in their coverage of presidential election results.\nThe late 1950s and early 1960s included a wide range of changes in American culture. One was a massive shift in how Americans received entertainment and news in their homes.\nAfter World War II, steadily increasing numbers of Americans stopped listening to radios and started watching televisions. That trend accelerated when color televisions became more affordable and more widely found in American living rooms. By 1972, a majority of American households had color televisions.\nThen, as now, the most important measure of success for television broadcasters is attracting and retaining viewers. The more viewers the more revenue from commercials. What better way to do that than use colorful and easy to understand updates in news broadcasts for election night coverage of presidential elections.\nFor almost 50 years, presidential election results coverage by the three legacy networks (ABC, NBC and CBS) had no uniform protocol on which colors to use to identify state results for presidential election candidates.\nIn some presidential election cycles, ABC, NBC and CBS used blue to designate states won by the Democratic presidential candidate, in other years they used red. The color pattern was reversed with designating state states won by the Republican presidential candidate. In one election cycle, for unexplained reasons, ABC used yellow to designate states won by the Republican presidential candidate. The unintended outcome was confusion especially with viewers who were \"channel surfers\" continuously searching for the most recent results.\nNo small wonder that veteran journalism observer Jodi Enda wrote the following in a 2020 Smithsonian Magazine article \"When Republicans Were Blue and Democrats Were Red.\" \"In the beginning, blue was red and red was blue, and they changed back and forth from election to election and network to network in what appears, in hindsight, to be a flight of whimsy.\"\nUniformity and continuity with color assignments finally became the norm starting with the 1996 presidential election cycle.\nPresently ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox and MSNBC all use the same color guidelines. They use blue for identifying states won by Democratic presidential candidates and red for identifying states won by Republican presidential candidates.\nBeginning in the 2000 presidential election cycle, the use of colors expanded greatly beyond being used to display state by state presidential election results.\nSince then, red and blue labels have been used and are routinely used to label political candidates and elected officials at all levels; campaigns, and where partisan elections are held — states, counties, cities and, towns.\nNo doubt that will continue but one major change may be in the future due to steadily increasing numbers of unaffiliated voters and independent candidates.\nDespite the fact that no third-party or independent presidential candidate has had success in winning states in presidential elections since George Wallace won five states and 46 electoral votes in 1968, it may happen again. It may happen as soon as this year.\nIn recent years two current U. S. Senators have already been elected after running as independents — Bernie Sanders in Vermont and Angus King in Maine.\nIf or when an independent or third-party candidate wins a state or states in a presidential campaign, the new color used to record that may be purple, reflecting a new normal when blue and red are no longer the exclusive options.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He spoke to real impacts of authoritarian governments of the past, but also to those currently taking hold, around the world and potentially, right here in America.\nLarry's thoughts, observations and quotes, particularly this one, from Trump, himself, \"I will be a dictator but only for a short time\" should give all Americans reason to carefully consider who steers Good Ship America in the upcoming four years.\nWe do not have to rely on what other people say about who, or what, Trump is; he, himself, tells everyone that tunes in to national media many opportunities to hear it, directly from his own mouth. Granted, there are many, many other media outlets and pundits that will spin who and what he is, and what he will do for you, if you vote to elect him. However, many of the promises he made during his first presidential run, were never fulfilled, for example:\nI'll build a great wall and Mexico will pay for it. NOPE.\nI'll repeal Obamacare and give you better, cheaper health care, NOPE.\nI'll bring manufacturing back to America, NOPE. Under his watch manufacturing jobs remained relatively flat, until they fell off the cliff as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI'll grow the economy by 4% per year, NOPE. Actually, his best year was 2018, when the economy grew by 2.9% over the previous year.\nI'll cut taxes for everybody, NOPE. While many, but not all, benefited, marginally, from Trump's tax cuts, the vast majority went to the rich and to corporations, some of them not even American.\nI'll terminate Obama's executive orders on immigration, NOPE. While one program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, (DACA), was challenged in our courts, it remains in effect, yet today. A second program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), never was implemented, so Trump could not terminate it.\nIf you listen to Trump now, he is regurgitating some of the same promises he failed to fulfill during his first term in office, even though he enjoyed Republican majorities in both the U.S. House and the Senate for his first two years in office. Which brings me to a word, or two, of caution to those who choose to vote in the upcoming elections.\nBe careful of those who don't keep their promises and be careful of the would-be dictator you vote to elect; you don't always get the kind of dictator you think you will, when you voted, based on what he and his minions tell you, and it is very hard to get rid of dictators.\nWILLIAM C.

Mr. Bruce's accusations of what Trump might do if reelected do not mirror Trump's actual record as 45th president, in which there were no wars and we had a booming economy.Mr. Bruce believes that Talbot County is rapidly sinking into the Bay and that four years of Trump will sink it for good. Have four years of Biden caused the waters to recede? I keep walking out to our pier and it looks pretty much the same but what do I know.\nTo quote: \"Talbot County women will lose the right to manage their reproductive health care.\" Could Trump really ban abortion in Maryland? The Supreme Court ruled that the states have the right to legislate their own laws. There will remain places all over America where unborn babies may be put to death, and in Maryland our legislative body and governor allow abortion right up to the point of birth.\nAs for taxes, cuts need not come from Social Security and Medicare but from the billions Democrats give to undocumented immigrants, housing and health care. Plus we give liberally to other countries. And there is so much more we now know about what actually works in the treatment of COVID.\n\"[Trump] seeks an immediate 10% import duty on all goods from China.\" Does this mean we might have to have our own manufacturing again and buy American-made goods? Under Biden there are inflation levels not seen since the late 1970s. Grocery prices are up and the infrastructure still is not fixed. What happened to \"Build Back Better?\"\nAs for the border, Trump is committed to the laws of the USA. Immigrants who follow the law are punished, those who break it are rewarded.\nAs far as \"loyalty to Trump\" I certainly hope he is chooses people who are loyal. As for being \"submissive to Trump\" how do Democrats continue to be submissive to Biden? It is abuse to force a man in Joe Biden's condition to make public appearances in which he repeatedly falls, stumbles over words, etc.\nMost tragic is the state of our economy and of our streets, as we witness the rise of carjackings. Instead of listing what Trump might do if reelected, please list Biden's accomplishments. Perhaps he has some, but none that I can see in Talbot County.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County experienced great success with Trump\n\n April 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SHARI WILCOXON | Section: Columns \n \n 844\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Jim Bruce posted an Opinion piece in the Star Democrat on Sunday, April 7, entitled \"Second Trump presidency could cause chaos.\" It cannot go without a response. Talbot County experienced great successes when Donald Trump was president. Prosperity for all people, regardless of race, is an undeniable statistic that Democrats try to ignore in the fearmongering about another Trump presidency. I wonder why they aren't touting Biden's record, like we do Trump's?It's stunning the unsubstantiated fearmongering over climate change. Obama purchased a $15 million mansion on the water. I don't think he really believes the handwringing about the shorelines they have wailed about since the 70s. Have any of Al Gore's predictions from \"An Inconvenient Truth\" actually happened? If the Left won't publicly go after China for their excessive pollution, it's very difficult to take them seriously.\nWhat substantive changes to the Talbot County shoreline can Mr. Bruce point to during Mr. Trump's presidency between 2017 and 2020? It was during his first presidency that Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris accords, and the net result was that the United States (down 10% since 2000 Source: Global Carbon Budget) continues to lead the world in reducing emissions while both China (up 208% since 2000) and India (up 155% since 2000), neither of which participated in the Paris Accords, continue to pollute and turn their noses from any efforts to reduce emissions.\nAs for women's \"reproductive health care decisions…\" the 10th Amendment in our Constitution is dedicated to states' rights. President Trump rightly helped remove abortion from the federal government and to the states. Anyone who believes that the state of Maryland is going to ban abortions is not to be taken seriously.\nDuring the first Trump presidency, the Affordable Care Act was not repealed or replaced. Secondly, after the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which took effect on Jan. 1, 2018, data from the Economic Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicate that federal receipts (taxes) have increased from $3.33 trillion in fiscal year 2018 to $4.44 trillion in fiscal year 2023. The increase in the deficit is not due to a lack of federal receipts from the implementation of the TCJA, but instead from a Democratic-run House of Representatives during the same time period approving continuing resolution after continuing resolution, increasing spending levels every year.\nMr. Bruce accuses Trump of campaigning \"further corporate tax cuts.\" Why do Democrats always use the fearmongering tactic that Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will have to be cut if we cut taxes? What about the billions the Democrats are giving to the many illegals in gift cards, housing, health care, food, education and jobs? What about the billions we give away to other countries?\nMr. Bruce thinks Trump wants us all to die. The real truth here is the Democrats want to give our pandemic response rights to the WHO. There is a vote due in May to accomplish just this scenario. Are there any Americans who believe that the WHO should have any right to make medical decisions and mandates for Americans? There are many studies that demonstrate that not only did the \"mask mandates\" not provide any health care benefit but they actually caused negative effects, especially for children. Newly obtained documents confirm yet again the many lies surrounding the origins of COVID-19 and the National Institutes of Health with Fauci's involvement.\nAnd Trump wants us all to be poor, according to Mr. Bruce. It is ironic that a supporter of Biden's \"Build Back Better\" economy is warning of inflation when under Biden we have experienced record inflation levels not seen since the late 1970s. It is currently being reported that grocery prices are up almost 40% since 2019. Gas in Easton this week is $3.99 a gallon for the 87-octane vs $1.85 four years ago (during the pandemic when people stayed home.) During the first Trump presidency, the dependency on foreign oil dwindled and the United States became the world's largest exporter of oil, driving down the cost of gasoline.\nIn the words of Jim Bruce: \"Trump pledges mass deportations...\" Most Americans know the 20-30 million illegals that Biden has allowed to come across the border are not sustainable. We are spending billions of dollars to support them. Many countries have emptied their prisons and asylums and deposited them at our border. We have an immigration process written in the laws. We should follow the laws to be fair to the people who are working to immigrate to America following the laws of America.\nTrump is also accused of packing the courts but under Biden people ... are imprisoned for misdemeanors, while actual criminals and child rapists are set free with no bail. It seems that Mr. Bruce thinks Trump is going to imitate Biden in going after political enemies. No, Trump has pledged to remove the two-tiered justice that is currently being meted out in America. Loyalty to America is everything to President Trump.\nShari Wilcoxon is a member of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee.

Scared me to death. Let's look at some of Biden's accomplishments:First he got writers cramp by eliminating all or most of Trumps directives. Stop building the wall (already paid for), let anyone and everyone including terrorists in the country. He halted the Keystone Pipeline, stopped oil drilling, etc, etc.\nHot mikes. In Florida after Hurricane Ian Old Joe comments that \"you don't fk with the Bidens\" in giving away FEMA money. Then recently in his campaign speech to the Congress he stated, \"I'm going to have a come to Jesus meeting with Netanyahu.\" Old Joe should speak to Jesus and find out who are God's chosen people. Our best ally.\nJoe goes on to kill 13 American soldiers in the flubbed withdraw of Afghanistan. He also left millions of dollars in equipment for ISIS to get back on their feet.\nJoe's programs caused shortages of baby formula, lumber shortages, medication shortages and more.\nThen Russia invades Ukraine. Old Joe says to our allies buycott Russian goods. Don't buy oil or gas from Russia. The U.S. couldn't supply them. Joe had already turned our country from a net exporter of petroleum to a beggar of oil from our enemies. Joe even pulled oil from our reserves to lower U.S. prices and to sell and give China some oil. In his infinite wisdom that oil from our reserves has not been replaced.\nJoe has done a wonderful job of creating inflation from higher oil prices, groceries, utilities, etc.\nIt's too long to list all Joe's accomplishments.\nI'll agree that Trump is like the east end of a westbound horse at times but I don't think we can stand four more years of Biden — then there's Kamala?\nCHIVY WIELAND\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Democratic Senate candidate Alsobrooks aims to bring new perspective to the Capitol\n\n May 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KATHARINE WILSON Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 981\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks hopes to bring a new perspective to the U.S. Senate. Maryland voters will decide on May 14 if she's prepared to make the leap.\"The people who are closest to the pain are also closest to the solutions,\" Alsobrooks said in an April 4 Zoom interview with Capital News Service.\nThe candidate, who has served as a county state's attorney and currently as county executive, believes that her experience being close to her constituents could bring something new to the Senate, highlighting the importance of understanding how policies impact people.\nAlsobrooks is running against Rep. David Trone and eight less-prominent Democrats in the Maryland Democratic Senate primary. Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is the Republican frontrunner.\nAlsobrooks was born in 1971 in Prince George's County to a working class family. What she remembers about her childhood is how her community stressed the importance of taking care of others.\n\"We had an obligation to care about the success of others,\" Alsobrooks said. \"That has stuck with me to really not only work hard to make sure that we're improving the world.\"\nShe attended Duke University for her B.A. in public policy and the University of Maryland School of Law.\nAlsobrooks started as an assistant state's attorney for Prince George's County in 1997, eventually becoming the county's first full-time domestic violence prosecutor.\nDuring her time in the latter post, Alsobrooks said there was a moment when she realized that her daughter was growing up in a place less safe than the one Alsobrooks grew up in.\nAlsobrooks said she decided that there was more she could do to address systemic issues in the county.\n\"There were so many in our courtrooms and courthouses who were seeking second chances, and I realized that many of them had never had the first chance of success,\" Alsobrooks said.\nShe was elected in 2010 as the Prince George's County state's attorney, the top law enforcement officer. Violent crime dropped by over 50% between 2011 and 2018, according to FBI crime data, when Alsobrooks was a part of a group of county leaders focused on crime reduction.\nAlsobrooks then won her election for county executive in 2018.\nShe takes credit for helping to build 10 new schools in the county, creating jobs and leading the county through the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"I've done policy, but I've also been on the implementation side,\" Alsobrooks said. \"We need people right now in Washington who know how to get things done, not just talk.\"\nAlsobrooks accepted 46 out of 50 police reform recommendations in 2021 that came out of the county's police reform work group. The tough-on-crime state's attorney said that good leadership and reforms can help solve problems in the criminal justice system.\n\"I believe that our families deserve to live in places where they have both justice and freedom,\" Alsobrooks said.\nOnly three senators in U.S. history have been Black women. There are no women in Maryland's 10-member congressional delegation.\nThis lack of diversity is one reason why Rep. Steny Hoyer said he endorsed Alsobrooks, someone he's known for about 15 years.\n\"I think that she will make a real contribution to the multiplicity of perspectives and opinions that we've brought to the Senate, so I'm a very strong supporter of hers,\" Hoyer said in an interview.\nHoyer said that the experiences that Trone has had are well-represented in the Senate, unlike those of Alsobrooks. Alsobrooks has shown excellence and a passion for helping people at every stage of her career, Hoyer said.\nOne criticism Alsobrooks receives from opponents is her lack of federal political experience.\nMaryland has only elected three senators without experience in the House, according to the Hagerstown Herald-Mail. However, most current senators nationwide have not served in the House, according to the Senate's website.\nAlsobrooks stresses that she has experience working with her constituents and the federal delegation to get projects and federal funding for the county.\nIn the Senate, Alsobrooks said, she wants to be an advocate for abortion rights, economic growth for Maryland and reduced healthcare costs.\nAlsobrooks has spent nearly $4 million dollars on her Senate campaign, according to the most recent Federal Election Commission reports. Her major donors include ActBlue and Emily's List. She has publicly criticized the wealthy Trone of attempting to buy the election by spending $41 million of his own money on his campaign.\n\"I do not believe that the people of Maryland are going to allow anyone to buy an election,\" Alsobrooks said. \"I think when they hear my record and vision, they'll support me.\"\nTrone has criticized Alsobrooks for her support while she was state's attorney for the death penalty in a murder case. Trone is opposed to the death penalty because he believes it is racist. Alsobrooks has since stated that she would not support a federal death penalty.\nPrince George's County Councilmember Krystal Oriadha, who endorsed Trone, claimed in a Zoom interview that Alsobrooks as county executive has not supported policies or funded initiatives Alsobrooks claims to support on healthcare and LGBTQ+ pride.\n\"I have to judge people off of their record,\" Oriadha said.\nThe reason why Alsobrooks believes she has gained the endorsements from many top Maryland Democratic politicians — including Gov. Wes Moore, Sen. Chris Van Hollen and five House members — is that she is a good listener.\nRep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Maryland) met Alsobrooks in the 1990s on Capitol Hill. Throughout the years, Mfume said in an interview, he has been able to understand her work ethic and her values as she moved through county politics.\n\"I've supported her and everything she's ever run for,\" Mfume said. \"I know her soul, her mind and I certainly know her history.\"\nAlsobrooks believes that she would bring something new to the Senate, both diversity and a different resumé than her competitors. Without the perspectives of mothers, women and all races, Alsobrooks said the delegation is incomplete.\n\"It is really important to have varied experiences there,\" Alsobrooks said about the Senate. \"Until that happens, I think our policies are incomplete.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trone sees himself as progressive conciliator\n\n May 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KATHARINE WILSON Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 1447\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Rep. David Trone views himself as an outsider in Congress. On May 14, Maryland voters will decide if the three-term lawmaker, self-described progressive and wealthy businessman, is the right Democrat to try to retain a Senate seat for the party.Trone doesn't play golf or hold a membership to any country club, he said, but that doesn't stop his Democratic opponents in the primary from criticizing him for being out of touch with Marylanders, PACs from calling him a \"billionaire bully,\" and some fellow politicians from seeing him as not a real progressive.\nHowever, Trone sees this image as almost an advantage in his efforts to reach across the aisle to Republicans.\n\"You're stereotyped because you're a white businessman so therefore you can't be progressive, but I'm far and away the progressive in this race,\" Trone said in an interview with Capital News Service. \"But I'm the progressive that gets stuff done … I reach across the aisle and figure out how to bring parties together.\"\nTrone is running against Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks and eight lesser-known Democrats in the primary. Trone and Alsobrooks by far dominate the field in spending, polls and ads.\nFormer Gov. Larry Hogan is the presumed Republican nominee for the Senate.\nTrone has represented Maryland's 6th District, which includes Western Maryland and parts of Montgomery County, since 2019.\nIn an April 9 interview with CNS at the Democratic National Committee, Trone discussed his life, House career and what he hopes for the future.\nAs he spoke, he effortlessly rattled off various statistics and facts about his record before running off for House votes.\nBorn in Cheverly, Maryland, in 1955, the congressman spent his teenage years working at his family farm near the Pennsylvania-Maryland border. After finishing his undergraduate degree at Furman University, Trone moved back to the farm, living with his father and brother.\nLife wasn't easy for the family. His father was an abusive alcoholic, Trone said, and they lost the family farm when the future lawmaker was in his mid-twenties.\nAs Trone put himself through an M.B.A. program on a scholarship at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School, he opened his first business brokering eggs and later his first beer and soda store.\nTrone eventually built an empire with Total Wine & More, his billion-dollar liquor chain that has grown to at least 266 locations across 28 states.\n\"I understand the value of work better than anybody in this race, it's not even close,\" Trone said.\nMaking his fortune off of Total Wine & More gave Trone the opportunity to run for office his own way, running without relying on PAC and special interest funding.\nTrone won his first election in the 6th District in 2018 after he lost his first House race two years earlier in a primary against Rep. Jamie Raskin in the 8th District.\nTrone has spent $41 million of his own money on his Senate campaign, according to the most recent Federal Election Commission reports. Outside of his own funding, Trone received $105,000 from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. The committee has not given him any funding since June 2023.\nTrone is a long-term supporter of Israel and has advocated for a two-state solution and a ceasefire in Gaza, positions he reiterated in an April 19 Senate debate.\nWhile Trone acknowledged that not everyone can self-fund a Senate campaign, he said that this allows him to be truly independent and fight against the pharmaceutical industry and other major corporations.\n\"I'm one of the few people that can do that,\" Trone said about self-funding. \"I'm willing to put my resources that I earned from zero and rather than giving them to my kids, I'm putting it into a campaign to change America the much better way.\"\nRep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Maryland) works with Trone on the House Appropriations Committee and endorsed the candidate in November. Ruppersberger said he respects Trone for being a self-made person and being a hard worker on committees.\n\"He still cares about helping his country and he doesn't need to do this for money or anything else,\" Ruppersberger said in an interview outside of the House chamber. \"He just cares about being a U.S. congressman.\"\nMaryland Attorney General Anthony Brown praised Trone in an ad for the campaign.\n\"He will level the playing field because he believes that everyone deserves an equal shot and he will always be there on the frontline of justice,\" Brown said.\nAlsobrooks, his opponent, has made headlines for her endorsements from other Maryland Democratic politicians including Gov. Wes Moore, Sen. Chris Van Hollen and five of Trone's colleagues in the House.\nTrone said part of the reason why he didn't receive those endorsements is because of congressional reforms he has proposed. They include instituting term limits, taking away special interest money in campaigns, eliminating stock trading by lawmakers and banning senators and House members from becoming lobbyists.\n\"The politicians, they're a part of the club…I'm an outsider,\" Trone said. \"They're all politicians who pat each other on the back…I don't do any of this stuff.\"\nTrone said he decided to enter the Senate race after Sen. Ben Cardin (D–Maryland) announced his retirement, presenting an opportunity to step up and be effective statewide.\nTrone also said in a Feb. 29 speech at the University of Maryland that he wanted to switch to the Senate because senators got more done than the closely-divided House.\nTrone's policy priorities are in mental health care, addiction, education, criminal justice reform and medical research.\nMany of these issues are personal to Trone, who is a cancer survivor, a public school system graduate and the uncle of a victim of a fatal fentanyl overdose.\nIn the last Congress, Trone said, he helped to pass 26 bills on substance abuse and mental health.\nHe funded the American Civil Liberties Union's Trone Center for Criminal Justice in 2015. Trone became passionate about criminal justice reform after being wrongfully accused of various business violations by a Pennsylvania attorney general during his time in business school, according to the ACLU.\n\"Justice was unfair to me,\" Trone said. \"I came out and …was able to be hugely successful. Others that are Black and Brown don't get that shot and that makes me madder than a hornet.\"\nTrone's campaign has not been without controversy.\nHe often touts his perfect record on voting for abortion protections and abiding by all Planned Parenthood requests to testify or write a letter in support of abortion access. Trone was also a supporter of an abortion clinic that opened last year in Cumberland, Maryland, across from West Virginia, which has strict abortion laws.\nHowever, Alsobrooks and other Trone opponents cite a Time magazine report last year that Trone's firm Retail Services and Systems donated to pro-life Republican candidates, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\nTrone stepped down from day-to-day operations of his businesses around 2015, he said, and funding GOP candidates was in an effort to protect his employees' jobs. For example, he was pushing for relaxing liquor laws in Colorado in 2022.\nTrone said that in federal races, he has donated only to Democrats.\n\"It was my job to protect the jobs of my folks' thousands of jobs in…those states that don't share our values in many, many ways,\" Trone said.\nDuring a House budget hearing in March, Trone mistakenly uttered a racial slur while talking about tax rates, drawing staunch criticism online. He apologized, saying that the word should never be \"used any time, anywhere, in any conversation\".\nTrone also has been labeled as a \"billionaire bully\" by Fight Corporate Monopolies, a progressive PAC, that ran an ad this month criticizing Trone's actions as a businessman, including a disputed claim about threatening a delivery worker in 2021 and emphasizing that the Federal Trade Commission sued Total Wine & More last year in a monopoly investigation.\nTrone's campaign has denied the threat allegation, saying Trone \"never made the statement this organization is alleging.\" The FTC settled with Total Wine & More in December.\nTrone claimed that he is the only one in this race who could beat Hogan in the general election, a race which could help determine control of the Senate.\nTrone has won in Republican areas of Western Maryland and he can therefore appeal to voters across the state, the congressman said.\nTrone also cited various recent polls that show his strength against the former governor. In nearly every poll since Hogan launched his Senate bid, Trone is the most competitive candidate against the former governor, who nevertheless is favored against both Democratic candidates.\nWhat sets him apart from Alsobrooks in this race, Trone said, are his connections in the Senate, his ability to prevail over adversity and his rejection of special interest funding in his campaign.\n\"I'm ready for the job day one,\" Trone said. \"I've created a $6 billion business from zero and started with nothing. Nothing has ever been given to me.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Biden's irresolute actions regarding Israel show feebleness and a self-serving attempt to save his political standing with the Palestinians. He needs to realize he is the leader of America.The vast majority of scholars contend that those killed in war, any war, all wars can be considered victims of genocide. When is this administration going to condemn the actions of Hamas and concern himself with the fate of the hostages?\nThis conflict started when the Hamas led Palestinians launched a surprise attack on Israel. Biden's supporters are funding these anti-Jewish dim wits. To make a puny comment regarding the college unintelligent demonstrators shows his inability to lead. He wants us to \"forgive\" college debts for these jerks — meaning we pay the bill.\nBiden is a doddery, decrepit, poor excuse for a leader of the greatest nation in the world and Kamala, the VP, is an imbecilic, doltish, senseless waste of protoplasm.

    "content": "Biden administration pressing social media, tech firms for antisemitism bans; Antisemitism Awareness Act moves to Senate (VIDEO)\n\n May 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 1762\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n President Joe Biden continues the U.S. administration's high-wire geopolitical and election year maneuvering regarding Israel's war against Hamas and Gaza amid progressive protests on college campuses nationwide.On Tuesday, Biden spoke at the Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremonies and the White House announced new and enhanced federal government steps to address increased reports of antisemitism by Jewish college students and others feeling threatened by pro-Palestinian protesters.\nThe U.S. plans include calling in social media and technology firms \"to identify best practices to address antisemitic content online\" via the State Department's Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism.\n\"Departments and agencies will continue to provide technology companies with relevant information about symbols and themes associated with violent extremism online to help them enforce their terms of service,\" the U.S. administration said.\nBiden and administration officials have frequently mentioned concerns about a rise in 'Islamophobia' in tandem with his pronouncements on reported spikes in antisemitic incidents and threats since Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks and the resulting war in Gaza.\nOn Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre again stressed the administration's post-Oct. 7 concerns about \"antisemitism, anti-Israel, anti-Muslim (and) anti-Palestinian,\" incidents.\nCongressional Republicans have also been summoning university president to Capitol Hill to query them on how they are handling campus protests and safety for Jewish students and staff.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union worries those are being used to squelch unpopular speech.\n\"Committee leaders are using McCarthyite hearings to intimidate school officials and press them to chill student advocacy and views they don't like,\" the ACLU said in a statement. \"These hearings have already threatened student and faculty speech & protest rights across the country.\"\nGOVERNMENT PUSHING FOR SOCIAL MEDIA BANS, 'DE-RANKINGS'\nLast May (before the October start of the war), the Biden administration launched a comprehensive strategy related to antisemitism that piggybacked on previous efforts geared towards anti-government alt-right and white supremacist groups.\nThat also included the U.S. government pushing technology companies and online platforms to ban accounts and voices deemed antisemitic to \"de-rank antisemitic and other hateful content.\"\n\"The Biden-Harris Administration also encourages all online platforms to independently commit to taking several actions that will counter antisemitism, including: ensuring terms of service and community standards explicitly cover antisemitism; adopting zero-tolerance for hate speech terms of service and community standards and permanently banning repeat offenders of these policies; investing in the human and technical resources necessary to enable vigorous and timely enforcement of their terms of service and community standards; improving their capabilities to stop recommending and de-rank antisemitic and other hateful content; increasing the transparency of their algorithmic recommendation systems and data; treating antisemitism as a distinct category in transparency reports; and more,\" the White House said in an announcement last May.\nGovernment pushes to get Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) and Alphabet (which owns Google and YouTube) and other large tech firms such as Apple and Twitter (now X) to restrict certain speech has raised the ire of free speech advocates.\nBut there is support — including from Montana lawmakers — for cracking down on pro-Palestinian protestors on college campuses.\nU.S. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Montana, wants the federal government to look at \"defunding\" universities financial aid and research and development grants if they fail to adequately address concerns from Jewish students and staff regarding antisemitic threats and incidents.\n\"These protests must be unequivocally condemned by every elected official and the universities promoting this kind of hatred must be defunded,\" Daines said May 1.\nDaines visited anti-war, pro-Palestinian camps at George Washington University in Washington D.C. Tuesday and condemned anti-Israel and antisemitic sentiments.\n\"Let me be clear: antisemitism has no place in America, and it's unacceptable that Jewish students feel unsafe on campuses,\" he said.\nIn @JoeBiden's America, our campuses are overrun by radical, antisemitic extremists and Jewish students feel unsafe walking to class.This is reprehensible. pic.twitter.com/CRqDbtvCTN\" Steve Daines (@SteveDaines) May 9, 2024\nU.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Montana, has called for foreign colleges students found to be supporting Hamas and other U.S.-designated terror groups to be deported.\nBiden — who has been a long time backer of Israel — voiced support for the push against antisemitism during Holocaust remembrance remarks Tuesday.\n\"There is no place on any campus in America — any place in America — for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind — (applause) — whether against Jews or anyone else,\" Biden said.\nISRAELI MINISTER: 'HAMAS LOVES BIDEN'\nThe next day, Biden and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed reports that the U.S. has delayed bombs and munitions shipments totaling approximately $1 billion slated to be shipped to Israel over administration opposition to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned offensive against Hamas in the Rafah area.\n\"We are re-examining a weapons shipment that was intended to go to Israel in the near future and this in the context of the events in Rafah. We have not made any final decisions. We have delayed the shipment. We made it clear that we are opposed to Israeli action in Rafah that does not take into account the safety of the Palestinian citizens in the city. We stopped one shipment of weapons and made it clear to Israel what we expect them to do before the operation in Rafah. We have not made a final decision on what to do with this shipment of weapons,\" Austin told a congressional committee Wednesday.\nBiden repeated that stance in an interview with CNN Wednesday repeating opposition to an Israeli offensive in the Rafah area of Gaza where Hamas fighters have sequestered among civilians.\n\"Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,\" Biden told CNN, according to the Associated Press. \"I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven't gone in Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.\"\nBiden — who is in a tight presidential race with former President Donald Trump — faces the possibility of progressive and younger voters not supporting his reelection bid in battleground states such as Michigan.\n\"We're not walking away from Israel's security,\" Biden told CNN, according to AP. \"We're walking away from Israel's ability to wage war in those areas.\"\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians (including Hamas fighters and civilians) and 1,500 Israelis (including soldiers and civilians killed on Oct. 7) have died in the Holy Land war. Hamas continues to hold hostages taken on Oct. 7 including several with dual Israeli-American citizenship though it is unclear how many are still alive.\nHamas' refusal to release hostages has been a prime impediment to a ceasefire.\nThe move upset pro-Israel Republicans as well as Israeli backers of the war and Netanyahu's quest to extinguish Hamas.\n\"Hamas loves Biden,\" said Israeli National Security Minister Itmar Ben Gvir, a hardline member of Netanyahu's cabinet, in a social media statement.\nHamas ❤Biden\" איתמר בן גביר (@itamarbengvir) May 9, 2024\nThat drew a rebuke from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, who has pushed Biden to restrict war aid to Israel over the war and civilian casulties.\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, questioned the Democratic administration withholding weapons from Israel.\n\"Withholding weapons from Israel is a catastrophic policy. This will be devastating and go directly against the will of Congress,\" Johnson said.\nThe GOP leaders have written to Biden and the Pentagon asking for details on the policy move after approving a $95 billion war aid package that includes U.S. weapons and military aid for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan as well as Gaza relief aid.\n\"We believe security assistance to Israel, Ukraine, and vulnerable partners in the Indo-Pacific should be expedited to the fullest extent possible. We expect your Administration will push departments, agencies, and industry to expedite contracting, production, and delivery of weapons and munitions critical to the defense of the United States and the free world in accordance with Congressional intent,\" Johnson and McConnell wrote.\nBiden and Congress also approve the annual $3.3 billion in military aid to Israel. The U.S. has provided $297 billion in military and weapons aid to Israel since 1948, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\nThat's the most direct aid from the U.S. to any country with Egypt ($165 billion), which has refused to open its border with Gaza to war refugees, and Afghanistan ($158 billion) next, according to CFR.\nANTISEMITISM AWARENESS ACT\nPart of the Biden administration's antisemitism is based on a broad definition of anti-Jewish sentiments as laid out by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.\nThe U.S. House recently passed that Antisemitism Awareness Act which instructs federal investigators to employ the IHRA definition in discrimination cases on campuses and for \"other purposes.\"\nBackers say it is needed and want a similar measure passed by the U.S. Senate and sent to Biden.\n\"Antisemitism has no place in our country. Our bipartisan bill ensures American law correctly defines antisemitism – raising awareness, keeping Jewish communities safe and secure, and better cracking down on this dangerous form of hate,\" said U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Arizona.\nCritics of the bill worry about its impact on free speech and a provision related to the Christian Gospels and Jews role in the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\"Antisemitism is wrong, but this legislation is written without regard for the Constitution, common sense, or even the common understanding of the meaning of words. The Gospel itself would meet the definition of antisemitism under the terms of this bill! The bill says the definition of antisemitism includes \"contemporary examples of antisemitism\" identified by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA),\" said U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida. \"One of those examples includes: '…claims of Jews killing Jesus…' The Bible is clear. There is no myth or controversy on this. Therefore, I will not support this bill.\"\nThe Christians United for Israel Fund— an pro-Israel Evangelical group — backs the antisemitism law saying it is needed \"when colleges are being overtaken by outside, pro-Hamas, antisemitic agitators,\" according to a statement.\nCUFI also faulted Biden for delaying the weapons shipment to Israel.\nA bipartisan contingent has introduced the Antisemitism Awareness Act in the Senate.\n\"In recent years, and especially over the past several months, we have seen a disturbing rise in antisemitism across the country and on our college campuses,\" said U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York,. \"This rise is unacceptable, and we must do more to protect our students. The Antisemitism Awareness Act would ensure the Department of Education has the right legal definitions needed to take action against all forms of antisemitism on our college campuses. No student should ever be the victim of antisemitic discrimination, and I am committed to working with my colleagues to get this vital bill passed.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Pun intended, I am \"trumping\" Ms. Wilcoxon's response.I completely understand your support for the disgraced former president. You have benefitted from outrageous tax cuts.\nYou are skeptical of climate change. Seriously? Have you ventured outside lately: We are experiencing record heat, fires, floods, tornados, melting of Arctic Ice. Yes, Al Gore's predictions are unfortunately true.\nReproductive rights? Seriously? My body, my choice. Trump is embracing the reversal of Roe v Wade, sending women's rights back to the dark ages. Shame on you.\nThe Affordable Care Act would have been repealed if it wasn't for the heroic vote cast by Sen. John McCain (deceased), who Trump referred to as a \"loser and sucker.\" Obama Care is more popular than ever, and Trump never had an alternate plan for health care.\nLet's talk about COVID. It was brutal listening to Trump discuss ways to \"fight\" COVID. First, he denied COVID. Let's not talk about it. ... It's only a few people; we have it controlled.\nThe border. Are you kidding me? The MAGA Republicans did not approve the toughest border security bill, written by James Lankford (R-Okla) because Trump told them not to. Why? He didn't want President Joe Biden to get credit for a tough border bill.\nPerhaps Shari Wilcoxon doesn't watch \"real news.\" Here's an update. Trump is facing court cases for tax fraud; interfering with a presidential election; responsible for orchestrating an attack on Congress (with the purpose of interfering with a legal transfer of power); election denying; hush money payments to a porn star to affect the outcome of an election; cozying up with dictators (because his goal is to become a dictator).\nThere's so much more. After stacking the Supreme Court with individuals who will do his bidding, rather than what is right, women have lost control over their own bodies. What's next? Let's see ... he would like the Supreme Court to give him absolute immunity from any criminal acts. I would love for Biden to have such immunity.\nTrump has already broadcasted his intentions, should he be re- elected. He wants to be dictator, abolish the Constitution, surround himself with enablers, free those convicted of insurrection and criminal shenanigans involving him and eliminate future elections.\nTrump could not get a job cleaning porta potties. He should be behind bars ... cleaning his own jail potty.\nBARBARA LEE JEFFERSON\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Listen to these people who once worked for Trump\n\n May 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 827\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Anybody appointed by a new president for an important job in the administration is usually thrilled to accept such an honor. If that president seeks reelection, we expect that those who served him, seeing him up close, would eagerly endorse his reelection. That consistent pattern in our history is now broken.Former Marine Gen. and Donald Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly in an Oct. 3, 2023, interview with Jake Tapper of CNN: \"Trump is a person who has no idea of what the United States stand for, no idea of what America is all about. A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person who has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law.\"\nMark Esper — appointed by Donald Trump twice, the first time as Secretary of the Army and then as Secretary of Defense — as per an interview with Christiane Amanpour on Amanpour & Co. on April 17 of this year: \"Donald Trump is unfit for the presidency. We need somebody who puts country first, who has character and integrity, somebody who can unify the country, and somebody who can lead. Donald Trump does not check any of these boxes.\"\nThese two men plan not to vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming election.\nThree conservative Republican women who worked in Donald Trump's White House do not think our democracy can survive a second Trump term.\nThey have joined together to be interviewed by newspapers and on television programs to make sure that Donald Trump is not reelected. They are Sarah Matthews, former deputy press secretary; Alyssa Farah Griffin, former White House communications director; and Cassidy Hutchinson, former aide to Mark Meadows, Trump's chief of staff.\nSarah Matthews was born in North Canton, Ohio, and went to Kent State University. She was a former Capitol Hill staffer before she was hired by President Trump's White House as deputy press secretary. She testified at the House committee meeting investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol that she resigned from her job at the White House immediately after the attack on the Capitol, and the President's refusal to condemn the violence.\nAlyssa Farah Griffin grew up in Los Angeles where her father was executive editor of several newspapers and an author. She is married to Justin Griffin, a musician, actor and producer. She was a press secretary at the Department of Defense and press secretary to Vice President Pence before she was hired at the White House by President Trump. She is now employed by CNN as a member of the show the \"View.\"\nCassidy Hutchinson, the youngest of the three women, was born in Pennington, New Jersey, into a working-class family. Her father liked President Trump's TV show \"The Apprentice\" but was otherwise apolitical. When she was a college sophomore in 2017, she attended her first Trump rally and was attracted by the crowds. She interned on Capitol Hill where she met Mark Meadows. She eventually ended up at the White House as the assistant to Mark Meadows, Trump's last chief of staff.\nShe became famous testifying in front of the House Jan. 6 committee with explosive testimony about what went on in the White House that day and later repeated this testimony to the Jack Smith prosecutors. Since 2021 she has been busy writing a book about her experience at the White House called \"Enough.\" This book has now spent several weeks on the bestseller list.\nThese three women noted in interviews that since Trump started to run for president again his speeches have become increasingly disjointed while threatening to undermine the Constitution, weaponize the Justice Department and jail his political opponents.\nThey were conservative Republicans who could not abide by Trump's behavior after he lost the 2020 election. His encouragement of those who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was the final straw for these women. They now advise former Republicans to vote for President Biden.\nThe attack on the Capitol also turned former Vice President Mike Pence against Trump. According to the Constitution, Pence was to preside over the counting of the electoral college votes in the Capitol. President Biden had more electoral votes than Trump. Trump would not accept his defeat and wanted Pence to change the electoral college votes.\nThese six people who worked with former President Trump in various positions and who all consider that he is unfit for the presidency should be listened to. Please, consider their advice in November.\nFinally, according to Nick Robertson of The Hill newspaper of April 9: \"More than a dozen retired four-star generals, admirals and other former military leaders filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court on Monday, arguing against former President Trump's claims of immunity in his criminal cases.\nThe group said Trump's claims would threaten the military's role in American society, our nation's constitutional order, and our national security and would have profoundly negative effects on military service members.\"\nLena Gill lives in Easton and is a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Will world's leadership role pass to China?\n\n May 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 714\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Tom Blair, a former Eastern Shore resident who shared imaginative and amusing displays on his estate on St. Michaels Road between Easton and St. Michaels, wrote a New York Times bestselling book — \"Poorer Richard's America — What would Ben Say?\"His book is based on Poor Richard's Almanack, a widely read annual publication written between 1732 and 1758 by American patriot, diplomat and prolific inventor Ben Franklin.\nIn his book Blair artfully blends a \"what if\" scenario if Ben Franklin traveled through time to offer his observations on America today along with Blair's personal observations on the same.\nThere are chapters on such issues as federal budget deficits, democracy, political parties, leadership, the Bill of Rights, foreign affairs, America's greatest generation, Keynesian economics, health care and many others.\nOne very timely chapter is \"The Rise and Fall of Nations.\"\nIn it, Blair recaps a hypothetical conversation between an American scholar and a professor at Cambridge University on Charles Darwin's theory on natural selection on the evolution of animal and plant species.\nIn Blair's recap of that conversation, the Cambridge professor maintains, as have others, that natural selection applies to civilizations, societies and nations as well as animal and plant species.\nAccordingly, civilizations, societies and nations also rise and then fall as the fittest become less fit and others become more fit.\nThe reasoning put forth by the Cambridge professor is the fitness level of civilizations, societies and nations are impacted greatly by changes in the speed of commerce. The speed of those changes increases continuously over time. Such increases must be met with a commitment by a dominant civilization, society and nation to develop and use technology to maintain its position.\nFailure to do so will inevitably lead to the rise of another dominant civilization, society and nation.\nThat view is affirmed with a review of the 16th and 17th centuries when Spain was the dominant global power. Spain chose not to apply their wealth to technology to expand their power further, but to enjoy a \"good life.\" As a result, Spain entered a period of steady and permanent decline.\nDuring Spain's decline, Britain built a navy using steam-powered ships rather than wind-powered ships as used by Spain.\nAs Spain became less fit, Britain became more fit and became the largest empire in history. When Britain eventually controlled roughly a quarter of the earth's land mass, it was said the sun never set on the British Empire.\nAfter World War II, Britain was exhausted from years of enduring relentless German bombings, preparing for a German invasion that almost occurred and demands for freedom from a large number of their colonies.\nAs a result, Britain replicated Spain's steady and permanent decline as the world's dominant nation.\nAmerica replaced them and has held that role ever since.\nBlair suggests America may be the next dominant nation to be replaced.\nHe further suggests the new dominant nation in the world may be China.\nBlair writes that China astutely watched the decades long cold war superpower arms race between America and the former Soviet Union.\nIn that decades long war, America and the former Soviet Union spent enormous amounts of resources on defense spending. That led to widespread economic turmoil in the former Soviet Union that ultimately led to their complete economic restructuring and an end to a cold war without a hot war between the two superpowers.\nWhile exact levels of defense spending by China are difficult to determine, experts estimate China's defense spending has been and is approximately one third the levels of America's defense spending.\nChina shrewdly decided their strategy would not be to try and position themselves as the preeminent military power in the world. Instead, their strategy has been to be the preeminent economic power in the world by developing (and in many cases stealing from America) the most innovative technologies in the world.\nSo far, they have been largely successful.\nBlair ends his book with a warning: \"America is peering in the wrong direction to see its greatest challenges; it is playing the wrong game.\"\nLeft unanswered in Blair's book is whether the American public and America's government leaders will acknowledge this grim reality.\nIf they do, another unanswered question is whether they will take necessary steps to avoid passing the role of world leadership to China before it is too late.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I was just picking up the baton,\" Gaddy said, explaining how he viewed his wartime military service as necessary and as a privilege. \"It was an honor. I knew what my purpose was. I was there to serve and protect our country.\"\nGaddy spent much of his tour of duty in battle zones and, as a result, he experienced that deep bond — that brotherhood — that soldiers have with one another because they're fighting side by side. \"You lived on a line and that puts you in a different frame of mind,\" he said.\nDespite the closeness that grows among soldiers in combat, there was little time for mourning in the heat of battle when a serviceman was killed, according to Gaddy. \"When one dropped out, you had to move up. Everything was too fast-paced. You had to keep the rest safe,\" Gaddy said.\nGaddy is blind today because metal fragments from a nearby explosion peppered his eyes in the midst of battle, sending him to a military hospital for about one week before he returned to duty.\nBut the damage to his eyes caused his vision to diminish gradually over the decades that followed Gaddy's honorable discharge from the Army in 1953. Gaddy's wife, Monolyne — they have been married 62 years — told the Cecil Whig that her husband has undergone 10 surgeries because he found himself plagued by cysts every time once-imbedded metal fragments surfaced on the front of his body.\nOn Sunday, Gaddy will be recognized for his wartime military service at Port Deposit VFW Post 8185 moments after the Memorial Day ceremony is completed, confirmed William Ward, who is the post commander. (Kevin Clark, a Gaddy family friend, was instrumental in bringing attention to Gaddy.)\n\"We are going to present him with a VFW coin at the end of our ceremony,\" Ward said.\nWard noted that Gaddy will be recognized during the portion of the program when the post honors \"our living veterans,\" which occurs after servicemen and servicewomen who made the ultimate sacrifice have been honored. During that latter part of the ceremony, Ward will present the Order of St. Michael medallion — a high honor — to one of the veterans affiliated with the Post 8185.\nAs for recognizing Gaddy, Ward commented, \"I will speak well of him, and I will speak well of his service.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Andy Harris, co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus? Marylanders should be asking this after he became the only congressman in Maryland who voted against a $61 billion Ukraine aid package. Fortunately, it overwhelmingly passed Congress, and recently was endorsed by the president.Tragically, for eight months Congress withheld critical aid for Ukraine. On May 13, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko criticized the delay as a colossal waste, a kind of messaging from Congress to Vladimir Putin that its OK to rampage Ukraine.\nThis unnecessary delay, favored by Harris, likely caused tens of thousands of civilian or military causalities. An American volunteer helping evacuate refugees is warning that the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv with 1.5 million residents may eventually fall, as Russian forces plan total destruction, worse than Hiroshima's devastation.\nFinger pointing for the delay goes to a few extremist members of Congress who threatened to oust House speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) for advancing a vote on Ukraine aid. Meanwhile, these pro- Kremlin Congress members were vigorously promoting a disinformation war to help Russia win. Evidence of this surfaced when House Foreign Affairs Chair Michael McCaul (R-TX) warned that much of the GOP was infected with Russian propaganda.\nLike a lot of Americans, Congressman Harris may be a victim of Russian propaganda. During an August, 2023 Town Hall he changed his previous support for Ukraine by parroting Kremlin talking points.\nDuring the meeting he advocated \"winding down\" Ukraine spending, citing concerns of waste and fraud and suggested the war was a stalemate. The Inspector General report debunked those concerns by reporting no fraud found in weapons to Ukraine. Just 3% of America's defense budget is authorized for Ukraine. That pittance of money is stopping Russia's autocratic march into Europe, preventing American soldiers from defending NATO territory and fighting Russia directly.\nHis suggestion for peace talks with Terroristic Russia is pure fantasy. Beginning in 1990, Russia savagely attacked Moldova, then carpet bombed Chechnya in two wars causing 300,000 causalities. This was followed by a genocidal invasion of Georgia, and the bombing of Syrian cities to rubble.\nIn April 2022, Russia produced a \"genocide handbook\" detailing plans to exterminate Ukraine's 40 million residents. Withholding military aid for Ukraine is analogous to a self-fulfilled prophecy, propelling Russia toward a genocidal victory while moving America closer to world conflict.\nDAVE ROOT\nDamascus \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maybe there is hope for America to recover values\n\n June 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JOHN McCULLOUGH JR. | Section: Columns \n \n 764\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n About a dozen years ago, I wrote a Star Democrat letter to the editor lamenting that the political Left had taken over all of the societal corridors of power and influence.I also stated that I believed this would require either a collapse of our nation, requiring conservatives to rebuild it, or that it would require a 30-year plan to raise our children to take them back. Thankfully, there was not a collapse, though movies like the recent \"Civil War\" remind us that this is still a possibility and in the mind of some, a very distinct possibility.\nThe American people, except for those on the coasts and in big cities, are still predominantly conservative, but the \"flyover\" areas of the country just didn't have the societal influence to prevail in the culture wars that have erupted. And though I have to admit that I was not exactly right, because conservatives are not trying to take back those lost corridors of influence, but rather I am seeing them set up a sort of \"political parallel universe\" to basically try to make those former corridors of influence obsolete, or at least to take away their power to control all narratives.\nThis is actually a better scenario for the country, because it can happen faster and without having to find ways to fire or replace those in power (who have dug in like ticks, and black ball any who might threaten them, to hold onto their positions). Instead, it simply gives Americans alternative choices on where to find more worldview-friendly places to get news and information, education, entertainment, goods and services, social media, etc.\nLet me give you some examples to buttress my point.\nA dozen years ago there was only one conservative news cable channel to get information, Fox News, while there were seven to eight liberal ones, which included the likes of CNN, MSNBC, the alphabet stations and several others. Now conservatives have at least four to five cable news channels to choose from and myriad places to get conservative news on the internet.\nConservative leaning colleges, like Hillsdale, Patrick Henry, Regent and Liberty University, are bursting at the seams as parents want to keep their children away from the culture rot and \"group think\" that is spewed by most of higher education nowadays. School board elections are being hotly contested as conservatives have realized they have to stop the liberal machine at an early age to protect their kids. Parents want their students to be taught how to think, not what to think.\nAnd Hollywood, through both viewers voting with their feet and even through the natural weaning away from movie theaters that happened during the pandemic, is also finding itself ignored in their woke bubble of self-importance. There is now even a conservative actors' guild being formed by those who were previously being muzzled or intimidated by power wielding Hollywood execs.\nIn sports, those who were being idolized for sitting down during a national anthem are now being booed. In goods and services, there are now those who proudly announce their \"made in America\" or patriotic stance on things to promote their products, and patriotic Americans are now \"canceling\" liberal businesses who try to shove their political views down our throats ... see Bud Light for a glaring example.\nAnd liberal social media, probably the most ruthless bullies out there, are now finding themselves challenged by alternative conservative options. Facebook is challenged by Truth Social and others. Twitter, bought out by Elon Musk, is a bold attempt of his to bring balance to the information universe. YouTube being challenged by Rumble. Podcast after podcast, talk radio show after talk radio show of conservative commentators are regularly growing their audiences while attempts by liberal commentators to do the same largely fall flat.\nAfter waiting a dozen years, it is encouraging to see Americans demanding and supporting this \"parallel political universe\" or what some have called an \"alternative economy\" that allows us to choose who we want to support with our time, attention and wallets.\nIn that old letter to the editor mentioned at the beginning, I stated that progressivism is just a new word for socialism and communism, and thankfully, the country is starting to push back in a dramatic and tangible way against that worldview. Maybe there is hope for us yet, to recover the values that made us the greatest nation in history with our foundations of faith, family and freedom.\nJohn McCullough Jr. is a licensed residential homebuilder.

However, as I reflected further on it, there were at least two major flaws in her comments.The first was accepting the media's out of context and its widespread distribution of reporting (deliberately or not) on former President Trump's response to a question on becoming a dictator if elected. The second was her assuming the accuracy of the media and others making that erroneous interpretation and then applying it to her assertion that anyone \"wanting to be a dictator for even a day (Trump's words not mine) has no place in this country as a citizen, let alone president.\" One can only challenge the extent to which any research was involved in supporting her opinion as expressed in that letter\nIn searching Politifact, (not known for its support of former President Trump), it references that interview between Sean Hannity and the former president wherein the question of his allegedly wanting to be a dictator emerged. The former president's response as reported in Politifact was \"No, No, No, other than day one we are closing the Border and we are drilling, drilling, drilling. After that I am not a dictator, OK.\"\nThat second flaw also highlights her avoiding any mention of the executive orders issued by President Biden, early in his term of office which opened the border to all and stopped the drilling. Obviously, both those actions have evidenced many negative consequences for the citizens of this country irrespective of political affiliation and presidential preference and was the basis for the former president's remarks. Therefore, I am puzzled by the illogic of some that the current president's actions had simply been accepted as a legitimate executive order despite the economic damage it has created while another candidate, if successful in the upcoming election, is being criticized as a dictator for considering that same approach in correcting it.\nI pray that the results of the upcoming election in November will be based on informed reason rather than emotional hearsay.\nTOM McLOUGHLIN\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Shedding a tear on Memorial Day is appropriate\n\n June 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 579\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last Monday was Memorial Day.The origins of Memorial Day go back to the end of America's Civil War, the deadliest war in American history. In that four-year conflict more than 622,000 Americans died, more than died in World War I and World War II combined.\nBy the late 1860s, countless towns and cities across America launched springtime tributes at the graves of fallen soldiers from both sides of the civil war.\nThese tributes were often community-wide events during which businesses closed, residents decorated the graves with flowers and flags and recited prayers to honor and remember the fallen.\nThe historical practice of placing flowers on the graves of the fallen led these events to be widely referred to as \"Decoration Day.\"\nThe first national observance of what is now called Memorial Day occurred on May 30, 1868, in the Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C.\nThe speaker was Civil War veteran James A. Garfield, then a member of Congress and a future president.\nIn 1938, Congress officially approved Memorial Day as a federal holiday.\nFrom 1868 until 1970 Memorial Day was observed annually on May 30. That date was selected because it was not connected to any battle or end date of any war.\nOver the years, the scope of Memorial Day was expanded to honor and remember all the members of the United States military who died in World War I, World War II. Korean War, Vietnam War, Operation Desert Storm, the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan.\nIn 1971, Congress decided Memorial Day should be observed annually on the last Monday in May partly to provide federal employees a three-day holiday weekend.\nSadly, since then Memorial Day has largely been replaced by far too many Americans from being a solemn day of remembrance, to being just the third day of a long holiday weekend.\nIt is characterized as the unofficial start of the summer vacation season, trips to the ocean or mountains, family picnics and retailers holding sales events.\nIt is time to restore Memorial Day to what it was intended to be.\nIt is a time to reflect upon stories like the one below by June Wandrey Mann.\nJune Mann served as a dirst lieutenant in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps during World War II.\nBetween 1942 to 1946, she served in Africa, Sicily, Italy, France and Germany.\nIn her post war book — \"Bedpan Commando\" — she wrote about her experiences. In it she wrote, \"Working in the shock wards, giving transfusions, was a rewarding but sad experience. Many wounded soldiers' faces still haunt my memory.\"\nHer recollection of one experience in August 1943 while serving in Sicily is especially heartbreaking.\n\"An 18-year-old boy is carried into the shock ward, and he looks up at me trustingly asking, 'How am I doing, nurse?' I just kiss his forehead and say, 'You are doing just fine, soldier.' He smiles sweetly and says, 'I was just checking.' Then he dies. We all cry in private. But not in front of the boys. Never in front of the boys.\"\nWith all due respect to Nurse Mann who was a member of the \"greatest generation,\" I suggest that at least once on every Memorial Day weekend, it is not only OK, but very appropriate to cry … in private, in front of others, or do both.\nWe should do so in remembrance of all American military veterans who as Abraham Lincoln observed in his Gettysburg Address, \"gave the last full measure of devotion.\"\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We conservatives have dropped the ball. We have allowed our Constitutional individual, local, and state rights and freedoms to be usurped by the federal government.\nIt is now evident that even our judicial system has been infected.\nFormer President Trump has been hounded since before he first took office and ever since. The legacy media has been complicit. He is the one greatest threat to the existence of this behemoth of federal government and those who benefit from it. That's why our institutions and bureaucracies have aligned against him.\nIf you think this is how our government should operate, consider what it would be like when conservatives take power again, as they always have, if they turn our judicial system against those who speak out against them. Perhaps you would lose your voice or be hounded by the courts or IRS. They won't, it's not in their nature.\nOur Constitution is a remarkable blueprint for a stable representative government. It allows us to right wrongs and to adapt to changing times. It deserves to be revered and protected.\nIf you are a conservative or a moderate, consider joining the Talbot GOP in restoring our Constitutional government as it was intended to be, a federation of states under a federal government with limited powers. Get involved and help us bring sanity back.\nIf you are a liberal who doesn't like the direction you see the country going, ask a conservative what (s)he really believes. The vast majority of us have the same concerns as you do, but different solutions. Try reading some conservative news sources to get a perspective different from the one-sided news you get from the legacy media. Be open.\nOnly after you've heard both sides of an argument can you apply your own common sense and experience to make a rational judgement. If you still disagree, we can try to build on the ground of our common concerns.\nKENT ROBERTSON\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I watched the interview, and I read the transcript. Make no mistake, this man will get away with whatever he can, however he can.He has made numerous statements re: his admiration for authoritarian and autocratic regimes. I am not going to change Mr. McLoughlin's mind, nor is he going to change mine. We can just agree to disagree, as this is a democracy, and we are still free to do that. My stance is not based on emotional hearsay. It is based on Trump's recorded words and actions, ever since he entered the political arena. Period.\nI see no need to go tit for tat on this subject, as that would serve no purpose but for people to become more divided and angrier than they are already. I will say, I will not, and could not, in good conscience, vote for someone who has been found guilty of sexual abuse, in a civil trial, and guilty of 34 felony counts, in a criminal trial. These trials were not rigged, as the 2020 election was not rigged. Had he been found not guilty, he would have said it was a fair trial. Had he won the election, he would have said it was a fair election.\nCurious that things are only rigged when he loses.\nIf people choose to vote for a convicted felon and sexual abuser, they are free to do so. If they want to hold this person up to their children and grandchildren, as a role model of the Republican party, they are free to do that as well. I, for one, could never defend that decision ... to myself or anyone else.\nLISE KING ROBERTSON\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It was his power to tell stories that help define who we are as Americans and commit us to a greater cause.At a tumultuous time in American history following the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam War, Watergate, widespread civil unrest and rising global tensions, \"Morning Again in America\" meant more than a booming economy. It symbolized a new era of confidence and optimism in our country.\nThere may be no greater example of this than President Reagan's historic address at Normandy on the 40th anniversary of D-Day honoring the selfless and heroic actions of the \"boys of Pointe du Hoc.\"\nThe heroes President Reagan paid tribute to exemplified the values that make our nation exceptional: noble, courageous, committed to our allies and higher ideals.\nThese Americans believed that our country and democracy as \"the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man\" was \"worth dying for.\" President Reagan's America \"loved liberty\" and \"willing to fight tyranny.\"\nWhile others hid for their lives, these Americans took the cliffs.\nToday, in a fractured media environment and deeply polarized electorate, that idea of American heroism seems to be further and further from the popular imagination. These truly American stories are a language that are not spoken nearly enough by leaders today, including in our party.\nDespite these divisions, these stories still have the power to remind us that there is far more that unites us than that which divides us.\nIn his Pointe Du Hoc address, President Reagan posed a question to the surviving heroes of the Normandy landings. He asked, \"You were young the day you took these cliffs, ... yet you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it?\"\n\"We look at you, and somehow we know the answer,\" President Reagan said. \"It was faith and belief; it was loyalty and love.\"\nThat answer President Reagan provided can guide us through the turmoil of our times. Faith in America; belief in the American people; loyalty to our nation; love of country, spoken with an optimistic spirit that resonates with Americans across generations and of any political affiliation.\nThat's what makes Reagan the Great Communicator and reminds us that our country's brightest days are still ahead because of the character and courage of the American people.\nI still believe, as President Reagan did, with faith, loyalty and love, in the promise of America.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan wrote this essay to mark the 20th anniversary of the passing of President Reagan and observe the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The shameful actions of the district attorney, the political activist judge, and his apparatchiks in the media, have shaken Americans' confidence in a fair and just legal system.The May 30 verdict is much bigger than President Trump; they are damaging the rule of law.

    "content": "Refugee crisis: Record 120 million people displaced by wars, persecutions, strife worldwide\n\n June 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: World \n \n 690\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A record 120 million people worldwide are currently refugees or have been forcibly displaced by wars, religious and social persecutions, civil strife, gang violence and extreme weather, according the United Nations.That's a 51% rise since before the coronavirus pandemic in 2019 when 79.5 million were forcibly displaced and up 165% from 2012 when 45.2 million forcibly displaced, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.\nCivil wars, persecutions and violence in Sudan, Syria, Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti and Gaza are big contributors to the record upheavals along with Russia's war in Ukraine and strife in Venezuela .\nRecord numbers of refugees and displacements come as U.S. President Joe Biden restricts asylums for migrants and refugees trying to enter the country via the border with Mexico.\nSyria continues to be \"the world's largest displacement crisis\" with 13.8 million people forcibly displaced, according to UNHCR.\nAnother 10.8 million people in the Sudan have been uprooted by the African country's civil war — which threatens to turn into famine.\nIn Gaza, the UN agency said 1.7 million Palestinians have been displaced in the post-Oct. 7 war between Israel and Hamas. That's 74% of Gaza's population.\nMore than 1.3 million have been uprooted in Myanmar due to a civil war and persecution from the ruling military regime — many of them Rohingya refugees who have fled to Bangladesh (where 920,000 mostly Muslim Rohingyas live in a sprawling refugee camp, according to the Danish Refugee Council), Malaysia and Indonesia.\nThere are 10.9 million refugees and other displaced persons from Afghanistan where the Islamist Taliban took over in 2021 after President Joe Biden withdrew U.S. troops and military assets and the pro-American government and military promptly fell. Many Afghan refugees have fled to Pakistan and Iran while many Syrians are in Turkey.\n\"Behind these stark and rising numbers lie countless human tragedies. That suffering must galvanize the international community to act urgently to tackle the root causes of forced displacement,\" said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees. \"It is high time for warring parties to respect the basic laws of war and international law. The fact is that without better cooperation and concerted efforts to address conflict, human rights violations and the climate crisis, displacement figures will keep rising, bringing fresh misery and costly humanitarian responses.\"\nRefugees, migrants and other displaced persons face harrowing journeys, persecutions and often have to pay smugglers, women and girls face rapes and sexual assaults and sexual trafficking.\nThe UN said 68.3 million people are internally displaced within their own country — a 50% rise over the past five years.\nAnother 43.4 million people are refugees worldwide with Afghanistan, Syria, Venezuela and Ukraine all with more than 6 million refugees, respectively, according to UNHCR.\nIn addition to wars, religious and ethnic persecutions and gang violence, extreme weather — such as storms and droughts some drive by climate change — and poverty are also driving migration waves from poor countries and regions to the U.S. and Europe.\nThe UN refugee agency and other migrant advocates are upset the Biden administration new asylum restrictions aimed at curtailing illegal crossings into the U.S.\nThe UNHCR said in a statement it was \"profoundly concerned\" about the Biden action which quickens deportations and looks to reduce asylum claims amid migration waves and domestic political worries about immigrants entering the country illegally.\n\"The new measures will deny access to asylum for many individuals who are in need of international protection, and who may now find themselves without a viable option for seeking safety and even at risk of refoulement. Any person who claims to have a well-founded fear of being persecuted in their country of origin must have access to safe territory and have this claim assessed before being subject to deportation or removal,\" the agency said.\nBiden's new asylum and immigration restrictions exempts unaccompanied minors entering the U.S.\nThe U.S. administration says that is being done for humanitarian reason by some migrant and anti-human trafficking groups worry more migrant and refugee families will split up to allow kids and teens to enter the U.S on their own and Mexican cartels and sex trafficking syndicates will take advantage of the exemption on both sides of the border. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Ranger captures D-Day heroism in low-key talk\n\n June 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Columns \n \n 953\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier this month was the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the largest liberating invasion in history and the beginning of the end of World War II in Europe. As has been customary in election years, President Biden traveled to France to offer a speech to commemorate this anniversary.Most D-Day speeches have been largely forgotten … with one notable exception.\nThat exception occurred on the 40th anniversary of D-Day, when then President Ronald Reagan delivered a D-Day speech affirming his status as \"The Great Communicator\" and a master of the spoken word.\nEver mindful of the power of optics in communications, the setting for his speech was the U.S. Ranger Monument at Pointe du Hoc France, overlooking the landing beaches of Normandy.\nJoining Reagan at the event were 62 Army Ranger D-Day veterans, the Queen of Britain, the Queen of the Netherlands, the King of Norway, the King of Belgium, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg and the Prime Minister of Canada.\nFollowing Reagan's remarks, presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told the Washington Post: \"For sheer oratorical eloquence, it would become one of the most inspirational presidential speeches ever delivered.\"\nEven longtime CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite, who previously covered World War II as a correspondent (and was never a Reagan fan), was reportedly deeply moved by the speech.\nIn what is now widely known as the Boys at Pointe du Hoc speech, Reagan included the following remarks:\n\"We're here to mark that day in history when the Allied peoples joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty. For four long years, much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow. Free nations had fallen, Jews cried out in the camps, millions cried out for liberation. Europe was enslaved, and the world prayed for its rescue. Here in Normandy the rescue began. Here the Allies stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human history.\nWe stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of France. The air is soft, but forty years ago at this moment, the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, and the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon. At dawn, on the morning of the 6th of June 1944, 225 Rangers jumped off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs. Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns. The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the Allied advance.\nThe Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers — at the edge of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine-guns and throwing grenades. And the American Rangers began to climb. They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again. They climbed, shot back and held their footing. Soon, one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five came here. After two days of fighting only ninety could still bear arms.\nBehind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the men who put them there.\nThese are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.\nAs memorable as Reagan's remarks are, I remember different D-Day remarks at a different time, in a different place. They occurred when I was in college during the Vietnam War.\nOne of our professors told us we would have a guest speaker at our next class. That was not unusual as our professor was well connected in the community and frequently secured prominent people to meet with us. He did not elaborate further so we had no idea who the speaker would be or why they were invited.\nWhen our guest arrived, we learned that he was not only a survivor of D-Day; he was one the surviving boys of Pointe du Hoc.\nThis veteran spent over an hour sharing his D-Day experiences.\nSadly, I no longer remember his name, but I remember his talk. He was low key, soft-spoken, reflective and humble.\nOccasionally, he paused as though the memories were too difficult to discuss. We could tell he was still deeply pained by his D-Day experience but was also glad his story was being heard.\nHis presentation was not a carefully crafted or rehearsed speech. There was no media coverage of it. His remarks were not recorded or distributed. There were no political dignitaries there, just a group of college students. Many of them were disdainful of older people (anyone over the age of 30) and disillusioned with the ongoing American military involvement in Vietnam.\nIn his closing comments, our guest said what so many of the greatest generation so often said after serving in the second world war: \"I didn't do anything special. I was not a hero.\"\nWhat happened next was totally unexpected.\nEvery student spontaneously stood up, shook his hand and thanked him for what he and his Army Ranger colleagues did. We told him what he did was very special, and he was a hero.\nThat was a special moment that I will always remember and cherish.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Trump, has been found \"guilty\" on 34 counts of what amounts to a misdemeanor under the usual circumstances. But since Trump is running for president of the United States, the circumstances are not usual, and so the law has been compromised in order to try to halt his campaign.\nA precedent has been set for political enemies to dig up frivolous charges against each other in order to take the other out of the running. This could result in chaos and the complete collapse of our system of government. Are politicians going to begin assassinating each other, as they do in other countries?\nI am reminded of Robert Bolt's play \"A Man for All Seasons\" about Sir Thomas More who refused to violate his conscience to please King Henry VIII. In a debate with his son-in-law, Thomas Roper, More claims that he would give even the devil the benefit of the law. Roper is appalled and wishes he could tear down every law which stood in the way of destroying the devil.\nMore responds thus: \"Oh? And when the last law was down, and the devil turned round on you — where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?\"\nTwo hundred and fifty years later, one of our founders, John Adams, defended in a court of law several British soldiers who had shot his countrymen in what is known as the Boston Massacre. Adams was an expert on British common law and to him the defendants, whether he liked them or not, had the right to a fair trial; he made sure they had one.\nWhat is British common law? It began with the seventh century laws of the Angles and the Saxons who began to have hearings in which evidence was presented. In the late ninth century, Alfred the Great codified the laws of the Angles and the Saxons, insisting that rich and poor, high and low, were equally treated. In 1215, the Magna Carta stated the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, which is one of the foundations of our judiciary.\nWe have taken our legal system for granted. When some people who commit crimes go free while others are hounded for much lesser offenses, then the laws become meaningless. The people who hate Trump are willing to destroy our legal system in order to ruin him.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Larry Hogan, who has been one of former President Donald Trump's fiercest critics in the GOP, received Trump's endorsement in his Maryland Senate bid on Thursday in an interview on Fox News.\"I'd like to see him win,\" Trump told the network during a trip to Washington, D.C. \"I think he has a good chance to win.\"\nThe Maryland race could determine control of the Senate, a point Trump noted in the interview.\n\"I would like to see him win, and we got to take the majority. We have to straighten out our country, so I'd like to see him win,\" Trump said.\nHogan, who was a popular governor, is trying to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in Maryland, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 2-1 ratio statewide.\nLate last month, Hogan angered Trump's campaign when he said that the public should \"respect the verdict and the legal process\" prior to Trump's conviction by a Manhattan jury on 34 felony counts related to hush money payments.\n\"At this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders — regardless of party — must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship,\" Hogan posted on X before the verdict was announced. \"We must reaffirm what has made this nation great: the rule of law.\"\nChris LaCivita, a senior Trump campaign adviser, shot back on X: \"You just ended your campaign.\"\nHogan, who is trying to navigate a difficult path running in a heavily Democratic state, has said he will not be attending the Republican National Convention next month in Milwaukee, July 15-18. Hogan did not attend the party's conventions in 2020 and 2016.\nIn the past two presidential elections, Hogan said he did not vote for Trump, the party nominee. Hogan said he wrote in the name of his father, former U.S. Rep. Larry Hogan Sr., in 2016 and the late President Ronald Reagan in 2020.\nHogan is running against Democrat Angela Alsobrooks, the chief executive of Prince George's County near the nation's capital. The Senate seat is open due to the retirement of Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I had almost forgotten the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle but it is so obviously appropriate in the upcoming November general election.Up and down the ballot we must stop the tramp of boots marching through our democratic way of life. It doesn't matter that Joe Biden is forgetful. He's a good man and loves his country and the people who call the USA home.\nHe has a very able VP in Kamala Harris who can take over if he can no longer fulfill the duties of his office in the next 4½ years.\nMy fellow voters, we will lose our democratic-republic to mad men if Donald Trump is re-elected POTUS for another four-year term.\nThe presidency, the Senate and Congress and the Supreme Court must be dominated by thinking, caring and fair-minded men and women. Thoughtless pawns will not make the kinds of decisions which will move this country forward and make this the shining example of democratic unity we've been since our history began.\nUntil the \"Trump\" party threat to our constitutional way of government becomes a whisper, we need to vote for those who support Joe Biden.

They also place all the blame on others when things have not gone or are not going well.True leaders do the opposite.\nThey generously share credit when things have gone or are going well, and they readily accept full responsibility when things have not or are not going well.\nA classic example of true leadership in thought, word and deeds was Dwight Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe during World War II.\nEisenhower assembled a team to plan for and oversee the execution of D -Day.\nTheir planning faced countless unknowns, not the least of which was the presence of clear weather, an essential element for mission success.\nDespite a series of conflicting weather forecasts leading up to D-Day, Eisenhower alone made the fateful decision to postpone the invasion launch by 24 hours. It was a most difficult decision but ultimately it was a most correct decision.\nOnce Eisenhower made that decision, he issued an \"order of the day\" to all the troops.\nIt read in part: \"Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force!\n\"You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on Fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.\n\"Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well-equipped, and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.\n\"I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full Victory!\"\nDespite his encouraging and inspiring words, Eisenhower privately had no illusions about success.\nMore importantly, he had the courage to accept full responsibility for failure.\nAfter releasing his order of the day, Eisenhower privately wrote a note now known as his \"in case of failure speech.\"\nHe wrote: \"Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold, and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon the best information available. The troops, the air and the Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.\"\nTwo last minute revisions to his handwritten notes speaks volumes about his leadership. He crossed out \"This particular operation\" and replaced it with \"My decision to attack,\" which is emphatic and personal. He also drew a long bold line under \"mine alone.\"\nIke didn't try to camouflage failure with phrases like, \"mistakes in planning were made,\" or \"planning assumptions were not met\" or \"I have nothing further to say at this time.\" He wrote simply \"any blame or fault ... is mine alone.\"\nOf course, we now know D-Day ultimately succeeded, and Ike never delivered his \"in case of failure speech.\"\nThe important thing is, he was willing to deliver it if necessary.\nHis acceptance of full responsibility is the kind of leadership Americans deserve today from our elected officials, appointed officials and candidates at all levels.\nIt is time to call a time out on the blame game in politics.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There were speeches about independence and freedom. But do Americans truly understand the freedoms they have? I fear many take them for granted.\nOn the other side of the world, an American is locked in a high-security prison, accused without any evidence of spying for the U.S. government. Since his arrest more than a year ago in March 2023, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been denied rights that Americans take for granted.\nHis trial will take place in secret, no evidence has been shown.\n\"To even call it a trial, however, is unfair to Evan and a continuation of this travesty of justice that already has gone on for far too long,\" wrote Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Emma Tucker. \"Let us be very clear, once again: Evan is a staff reporter of The Wall Street Journal. He was on assignment in Russia, where he was an accredited journalist.\"\nTucker said of the secret trial, \"we already know the conclusion: This bogus accusation of espionage will inevitably lead to a bogus conviction for an innocent man who would then face up to 20 years in prison for simply doing his job. And an excellent job he was doing, at that.\"\nThe right to a speedy and public trial. The right to counsel. Freedom of the press.\nThese are rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution. They are not rights in authoritarian Russia.\nEvan Gershkovich is not a spy. He is a journalist for the Wall Street Journal. He was on a reporting assignment when he was detained and accused of espionage. Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal and the U.S. government deny allegations he is or ever has been a spy.\nAfter Gershkovich appeared in a Russian court last month, the Journal reported John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, condemning the proceedings against Evan as a \"sham trial.\" He said Gershkovich \"is simply being used as a bargaining chip,\" along with another American held by Moscow, Paul Whelan.\nRussian investigators haven't publicly presented evidence to back their allegations against Gershkovich. And Russia's legal system offers few, if any, of the legal protections accorded in the U.S. and other Western countries. Acquittals in espionage cases are exceedingly rare.\nWhat is happening to Gershkovich shows how precious American rights and freedoms are. They should never be taken for granted.\nAs the glow of the Independence Day celebrations fade for another year, Americans should keep the rights and freedoms celebrated on July Fourth burning bright every day.\nJim Johnson is executive editor of the Star Democrat.

    "content": "Think before electing a convicted felon president\n\n July 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LARRY PIFER | Section: Columns \n \n 383\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Donald Trump is a convicted felon.A jury of 12 people found him guilty on 34 counts of trying to influence the presidential election in 2016 by falsifying business records to hide the evidence that he paid a porn star $130,000 to stay quiet about their sexual relationship.\nThose are the facts. Yet despite this, the Republican party offers this felon as their presidential candidate in the 2024 election. This astounds and amazes me.\nThe Republicans would have you believe that the trial was politically motivated with unfair judges, unfair courts and biased jurors who were randomly selected. None of that is true.\nUnder our Constitution and judicial precedents, anyone accused of a felony must first be indicted by a grand jury, tried by an impartial jury of their peers in the state where the alleged crime occurred and convicted only by a unanimous verdict of the jury.\nIn Trump's case there were 12 people randomly chosen who all rendered a guilty verdict. This is what would happen to me or to you if we were accused of a felony, a serious crime. Thank heaven we have such a justice system with these due process protections that determines if the accused is guilty or innocent. Donald Trump was found guilty of a felony crime 34 times by 12 citizens who swore an oath to be impartial.\nIt is bad enough that our next president might carry the label of a felon, but there are also things that a convicted felon cannot do that might impair the ability of the next president to carry out his duties.\nThere are 37 countries in the world where convicted felons are not welcome including Canada, Mexico, China, Australia and South Africa. If Trump were incarcerated on Nov. 5, then under Florida law he cannot vote in Florida for president. Federal law prohibits felons from possessing firearms and most states have analogous prohibitions.\nA felon would have difficulty securing a security clearance, and anyone other than the president needs one to handle classified materials.\nHow can any American citizen support a convicted felon for president of the United States?\nI appeal to all of you to think clearly before you choose a convicted felon for the highest office in our land.\nLarry Pifer is a resident of Easton and is a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Election 2024: It ain't over until it's over\n\n July 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Columns \n \n 793\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n We live in a VUCA world, a world characterized by increasingly high levels of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity.In such a world, I suggest a guiding principle when offering observations on campaigns and elections.\nIt is: In every election cycle anything can happen with any candidate or any campaign at any time until the votes are cast, counted and certified.\nBaseball great Yogi Berra said it more succinctly when he said this about every game of baseball: \"It ain't over till it's over.\"\nI think about that every time I read or hear political pundits and others opine with campaign and election predictions.\nAfter a debate where President Biden performed very poorly, countless pundits have said or written it is just a matter of time until Biden voluntarily withdraws from a reelection race (currently not likely), is denied his party's nomination (also currently not likely) or loses a grudge rematch with former President Trump (currently likely but certainly not a given).\nFor a perspective on all this, I suggest a review of the 1968 presidential election cycle.\nThe political environment then compared to today is strikingly familiar.\nThen as now:\nVoters were and are deeply divided along generational, income, racial and ideological lines.Crime and lawless behavior were and are at epidemic levels in urban areas, suburban areas and rural areas across America.\nProtests were and are occurring on college campuses over American foreign policy decisions.\nInflation rates were and are up due to government spending on domestic and foreign policies.Concerns were and are being raised daily on the incumbent president's health and his ability to serve another full term.\nDespite all of the above, conventional wisdom early in 1968 was incumbent Democratic President Lyndon Johnson would run for re-election.\nIn March 1968, LBJ shocked the political world, ending a nationally televised address with: \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\nFollowing that speech, expectations were that Robert F. Kennedy, the U.S. senator from New York and heir apparent of the Kennedy legacy in American politics would secure the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. His assassination immediately following his declaring victory in the California Democratic primary in June put a tragic end to that scenario.\nUltimately, under Democratic Party presidential nomination rules in place at the time (no longer in place) the leaders and power brokers in the Democratic Party convinced Democratic National Convention delegates to nominate Hubert Humphrey as their presidential candidate. Humphrey was Johnson's loyal (some say subservient) vice president.\nConventional wisdom was Humphrey was the best candidate to keep the historic New Deal coalition in place that since 1932, had elected Democratic presidential candidates Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.\nConventional wisdom was also that Richard Nixon would not win the Republican nomination given the fact that Republican New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and Republican California Gov. Ronald Reagan were challenging him. Nixon had already lost to John F. Kennedy in a close presidential election in 1960 and lost in a race for California governor in 1962.\nDespite those two losses and despite being a very polarizing figure in American politics long before Watergate, Nixon won the Republican presidential nomination.\nFollowing a chaotic Democratic Party convention in Chicago, expectations were that Humphrey would lose to Nixon based in part on an assumption that George Wallace's aggressive third-party presidential bid would draw traditional Democratic party voters away from Humphrey.\nSurveys from August through late October seemed to confirm that outcome. In all those polls, Humphrey trailed Nixon. Some pollsters predicted a margin of victory for Nixon as high as 16%.\nIn October, everything changed. George Wallace's third-party campaign was faltering. LBJ suspended bombing in the Vietnam War and announced the possibility of peace talks that could end the long and increasingly unpopular war. Humphrey decided to distance himself from LBJ by branding himself as Hubert Humphrey, not as Vice President Humphrey.\nAs a result, just before Election Day, pollsters concluded the race between Humphrey and Nixon was a tossup.\nThose conclusions were validated when Nixon secured a close victory in the popular vote with just over 500,000 votes (0.7%) separating him and Humphrey.\nSome have suggested had the election been held two weeks later Humphrey could have won. What is known is that had Humphrey not narrowly lost the popular votes in California, Ohio and Illinois, he would have won both the popular vote and the vote in the Electoral College.\nJust as in the 1968 presidential election cycle, a lot can and will occur between now and November 2024.\nI suggest supporters of President Biden, supporters of former President Trump and supporters of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. do this — acknowledge and embrace the timeless wisdom of Yogi Berra — \"It ain't over till it's over.\"\nDavid Reel is a public relations and public affairs consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Assassination has no place in American politics\n\n July 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 586\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n We find it difficult to find the words to express our full loathing of what took place last week at a Donald Trump campaign rally.We're not going to dignify the would-be assassin by naming him. He failed. He was killed by Secret Service members of Trump's protective detail.\nTragically, he wasn't the only fatality. He missed Trump with multiple shots, and in doing so murdered someone who was in the crowd at the rally. Trump was wounded, narrowly avoiding a much more serious injury.\nLet us be crystal clear: Assassination has no place in American politics.\nWe don't care who you are, there is zero place for murder as a political tool in this nation. It is abhorrent, a trait found more often in the kind of dictatorships exemplified by Russia's Vladimir Putin or North Korea's Kim Jong Un.\nWe reject out of hand whatever warped thoughts led the shooter to believe he was in the right. Democracy depends on the ability of people to disagree without violence, without resort to the kind of lethal aggression shown Saturday.\nThe shooter is dead, according to authorities. But we still want to address the person directly.\nYou think you aimed at a threat? You aimed at democracy.\nYou think you shot at an enemy? You fired at faith in the American system.\nDonald Trump has earned plenty of criticism. His actions led to the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. We condemned his role in that.\nCondemnation of acts is a far cry from an attempt at extrajudicial execution. The shooter took not just the law, but the power of life and death into his own hands. It was an act of barbarism, a rejection of the fundamental ideals this nation has relied on for nearly 250 years.\nThis should be a wakeup call to all political figures to turn down the rhetoric. It won't be. Politicians have found that hate sells, whether that's hate of the right or the left. They've found that antisemitism, islamophobia and a world of other hatreds all have constituencies. They have learned that playing to hatred brings votes.\nSo, too, have some in the media learned that lesson. We try to bring you news in as neutral a fashion as we can. We don't always get it right, but we always try. Unfortunately, the best evidence is something the public never sees: submissions so vile we refuse to print them.\nNot so those from cable's talking heads, who have learned that demonization sells. They have learned that creating a captive audience brings profits. And, in this economic landscape it's a case of profits uber alles.\nThe toxic brew of hatred must end. We have editorialized over and over with calls for people to see each other as people, not as enemies. Disagreement without hatred is not just possible, it is essential.\nWe as a nation are better than what happened Saturday. We are better than the impulse to believe that violence is the answer, regardless of what irresponsible demagogues encourage.\nThe only appropriate response to Saturday's events is revulsion. The only way to respond to such insensate hatred is with rejection. This is not who, we hope, we are as Americans. It's certainly not who we should be.\nSome four decades ago Ronald Reagan spoke about America as a shining city on the hill. With events like this the city loses a bit more luster. Assassins would drag us down into the depths of despondency and demagoguery.\nWe must be better.\nThis editorial was written by Matt Milner, editor at the News Leader in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Larry Hogan, whom she is running against in the November general election to fill retiring Sen. Ben Cardin's (D-Md.) seat.\nAs Democrats fight to maintain their slim Senate majority, Hogan's popularity in Maryland has raised GOP hopes of winning what has long been considered a solidly blue seat. This has made Maryland's Senate race one of unexpected national significance.\n\"I like Larry Hogan,\" she said. \"I worked with him as county executive when he was governor.\"\nBut Alsobrooks said the race \"is so much bigger than Larry Hogan. It is about the 51st vote, and we know what the 51st vote really controls in our country.\"\nAlsobrooks said the political party in power in the Senate controls the agenda, and there are two \"very different views\" on what that agenda should be. She said the Senate majority vote will determine who is on the Supreme Court.\nDuring her speech, Alsobrooks mentioned a variety of issues. She talked about the importance of protecting reproductive rights, making sure there is a fair tax structure in place and preserving Social Security.\nAccording to a June poll from Public Policy Polling, Alsobrooks, who won the Democratic primary in May, was found to be leading her opponent in the race by 11%. The poll — which surveyed 635 Maryland voters on June 19 and June 20 and had a 3.9% margin of error — showed Alsobrooks leading with 45% of the vote compared to Hogan's 34%.\nAccording to the Federal Election Commission, Alsobrooks' campaign has raised $12.47 million and spent $8.91 million between May 1, 2023, and June 30. Hogan's campaign has raised $7 million and spent $4.34 million between Jan. 1 and June 30.\nPine Street Community Market and the Dorchester County Democratic Party hosted Alsobrooks at 711 Pine St. in Cambridge.\nEddie Beasley, who owns the market, said he would like to see Alsobrooks get elected because she would be Maryland's first Black U.S. senator.\n\"Everybody needs to be represented,\" he said.\nDoris Mason, a retired social worker for the state, said some of the important issues to her are Social Security, support for families and children, and housing, which she said is a top priority in Dorchester County.\nAlsobrooks — who also delivered remarks at the United Association Mid Atlantic Pipe Trades annual summer convention in Ocean City and attended a clothing donation drive at the Worcester County Library-Ocean Pines Branch in Berlin on July 17 — said in an interview with The Star Democrat that she has been to the Eastern Shore \"a number of times.\"\nHogan also has been to the Eastern Shore multiple times since announcing his candidacy. In June, Hogan visited the Simmons Center Market in Cambridge, where he received endorsements from Dorchester County Councilman Ricky Travers and County Council Vice President Mike Detmer.\nOn Wednesday, Alsobrooks said her trips to the Shore won't stop if she is elected senator.\n\"I've walked this community,\" she said about Cambridge. \"We've been here a number of times, and I will continue to come here as a senator.\"\nDuring her speech in the market, Alsobrooks talked about how her family has shaped who she is and what she fights for. She talked about her grandmother, Sarah.\nAlsobrooks said that her grandmother was a housekeeper at hotels in an around Washington, D.C., but had a desire to work in federal government. To work in federal government, you had to pass a typing test, Alsobrooks said.\n\"Sarah could not afford a typewriter,\" Alsobrooks said. \"So she went into the kitchen of the family's apartment, put a white piece of paper up on the refrigerator, drew a key board on that white piece of paper.\"\nAlsobrooks said her grandmother taught herself keystrokes on that piece of paper on the refrigerator and was able to pass the exam and get a government job.\n\"And I want you to know that I am Sarah's legacy,\" she said. \"I understand that we all want the same things for our family. And that is what I have fought to deliver. (It) is what I continue to deliver.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Maryland GOP shuts out reporters in Milwaukee\n\n July 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JOSH KURTZ Maryland Matters | Section: Columns \n \n 1021\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n MILWAUKEE — I'm standing across the street from the apartment where I lived, back in 1983, in this city's River West neighborhood.The street looks substantially the same, though I'm sorry to discover that Harry's Chapel, the tavern that used to be two doors down, where a 12-ounce glass of Miller High Life on tap sold for a quarter, is gone.\nIf I squint hard enough, I can see my 21-year-old self, sitting in the sun on the second-floor balcony, writing letters to family and friends by hand.\nWhat I can't see as clearly, as I traverse this Bavarian-inspired city during the week of the Republican National Convention, are the folks I came here to cover, the members of Maryland's convention delegation.\nThat's because the leaders of the state GOP, in a departure from anything I've ever experienced — and this is the sixth Republican convention I've covered and my 14th overall, if you include the Democrats' — have decided that all of the delegation's events will be off-limits to the media. As will the delegates themselves.\nIn the days leading up to the convention, and into this week, the party's executive director, Adam J. Wood, asked me and other reporters to submit questions to delegates through him, with no guarantees that he'd be able to provide answers or get these people on the phone.\nBeginning Sunday, and throughout the week, a reporter for the Baltimore Sun, two reporters from the University of Maryland's Capital News Service and I, individually and as a group, have been asked to leave the hotel in downtown Milwaukee where the delegation is staying and meeting. Once I was escorted out of the hotel by a party functionary.\nOn Wednesday, all four of us arranged to show up at the hotel, a beautiful 1896 building that once was the headquarters for a large insurance company, to try to get into the delegation breakfast together. Wood once again, almost apologetically, reminded us we would not be allowed in.\n\"It's the chairwoman [Nicole Beus Harris], it's the national committeeman [David Bossie], and I can't override that,\" he said.\nLater in the morning, as the delegation breakfast was breaking up, all four of us were escorted out of the building by the hotel general manager, at the request of the state party.\nMaryland GOP delegates have been instructed not to speak to reporters without permission from the party higher-ups — including on the floor of the Fiserv Center, the arena where the convention itself is taking place.\nIt's the Maryland GOP's right to set the rules for media access at a political convention — or anyplace else. It's not a public entity, and they aren't bound by open meetings laws.\nBut what is lost when a political party refuses media access at its most high-profile quadrennial event?\nFor the party, the answer starts with this: Free publicity.\nFor four mornings during the week of a national political convention, state delegations hold breakfasts at the hotels where they're staying. These feature political speeches, tips on partisan talking points, and a look ahead to the day's events in the convention city and on the convention floor.\nIn my experience, these breakfasts almost always create news and generate media coverage. Delegations generally attract an array of speakers from across the country, not just from the home state.\nWood told us Wednesday that speakers at the delegation breakfasts this week have included Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry (R), Arizona GOP Senate nominee Kari Lake, U.S. Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.), and Congressman Harris, the husband of the state GOP chair. That's an interesting lineup.\nI would have covered these speeches as straight news stories. I would have asked the Maryland delegates for their reactions to what they had heard. I was looking forward to traveling around town with the delegation this week, to better understand events as they were unfolding, from their perspective. I'm sure I could have produced some entertaining and informative news briefs.\nI was planning to spotlight emerging party leaders and other key players and use what I see here as a building block to future political coverage. I'm always, on the political beat, looking for the next big thing.\nI'm still trying to do all that, but it's a lot harder to succeed under these conditions — and requires way more psychic energy than I ought to be expending.\nBut this isn't meant to be about me and my desire to deliver solid content for our readers — and justify the expense to my nonprofit news outlet for sending me here.\nMost state delegations to this convention, as I understand it, are welcoming reporters to their daily breakfasts. Some of these events are being broadcast live on C-SPAN.\nThe Maryland Democratic Party will continue to allow reporters at most of its events during the national convention next month in Chicago — even though that convention is shaping up to be considerably messier and far less joyful than this one has been.\nLook, this Republican Party is a lot different from the GOP of old. There's far less ideological diversity in the party, and successful Republican politicians from Donald Trump to Larry Hogan have figured out how to communicate with the public directly, without the filter of news outlets.\nThere's a conservative media ecosystem now that was only beginning to evolve two dozen years ago, and many Republicans have become extremely hostile to the mainstream media. The image of angry rally-goers giving the finger to reporters minutes after Trump was shot at a rally in Pennsylvania last week was chilling and will be hard to forget.\nSo all this is of a piece, I suppose.\nBut Republicans are deep in the minority in Maryland. I'd like to hear someone explain how severely curtailing the ability of the state's media outlets to do our jobs is going to expand their base and help them reach the persuadable public.\nI knew this would be a nostalgic week for me, being in Wisconsin, where I lived for five years. I just never imagined I'd be feeling nostalgia for a time-honored practice that, for one Maryland political party at one moment in time, at least, appears to be gone.\nJosh Kurtz writes for Maryland Matters.

    "content": "History is filled with many 'what if' questions\n\n July 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 822\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Those who study history regularly ask the question — what if? What if certain watershed events in American history had never occurred or had occurred much differently?One such watershed event was the war in Vietnam.\nHistorians to this day ask what if decisions made on escalating or de-escalating that war had been made by President John Kennedy and not by President Lyndon Johnson.\nMilitary historian Fred Kaplan makes a compelling case that if Kennedy had not been assassinated in November 1963, the outcome and duration of that war would have been much different.\nKaplan makes his case based on Kennedy's actions and decisions during the biggest crisis of his presidency — the Cuban Missile Crisis.\nPrior to that crisis, Kennedy's leadership capabilities were challenged regularly by his opponents. They were especially scornful of his disastrous Bay of Pig's invasion of Cuba in April 1961 and his disastrous summit meeting with Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev in June 1961. Following that summit Kennedy privately acknowledged \"he just beat the hell out of me.\"\nPerhaps those two events emboldened Khrushchev to place Soviet medium- and long-range nuclear missiles in Cuba in October 1962.\nThat decision resulted a 13-day period where World War III between America and the Soviet Union was more likely than ever before or since.\nThe fact that it did not is a testament to Kennedy's masterful leadership skills.\nWhen Kennedy was made aware of that grave threat to from nuclear missiles less than 90 miles from America, he assembled a group of civilian and military advisors to evaluate and oversee an appropriate American response.\nThose advisers included the eight members of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Undersecretary of State George Ball and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.\nWith one exception (George Ball), Kennedy's advisers strongly supported direct military action including bombing the missile sites and invading Cuba.\nAfter 13 days of a tense standoff between the two superpowers, Khrushchev secretly and unexpectedly offered a deal to end the crisis. The deal terms were Russia would remove their nuclear missiles in Cuba that were pointed at American targets if America would remove American nuclear missiles in Turkey pointed at targets in the Soviet Union\nKennedy's advisers with one exception (Ball) vehemently opposed the deal. They continued to support plans drawn up by the military and Defense Secretary McNamara that called for 500 conventional bombing sorties of the Soviet missile sites and air bases daily for seven days, followed by an invasion of Cuba.\nFollowing receipt of the Khrushchev offer McGeorge Bundy bluntly told Kennedy — \"I think we should tell you … the universal assessment of everyone in the government who's connected with the alliance problem (NATO) is if we appear to be trading the defense of Turkey for the threat in Cuba, we will face a radical decline.\" Secretary McNamara ended his review of suggested next steps with \"before we attack Cuba.\"\nAfter listening to his adviser's opinions Kennedy, told them \"I'm just thinking about what we're going to have to do in a day or so. … Five hundred sorties … and possibly an invasion, all because we wouldn't take missiles out of Turkey. And we all know how quickly everybody's courage goes when the blood starts to flow, and that's what's going to happen in NATO … when we start these things and the Soviets grab Berlin, and everybody's going to say, 'Well, this Khrushchev offer was a pretty good proposition.\"\nKennedy knew that the American missiles in Turkey were rapidly becoming obsolete and had no long-term military value to America.\nHe told his advisers calmly but resolutely he was sending his brother Bobby (who bitterly opposed the deal) to tell the Soviet ambassador to the United States that America was accepting the Khrushchev proposal.\nIt was a moment reminiscent of a Cabinet Meeting in the White House 100 years earlier when President Lincoln polled his cabinet members on his proposed new battle strategy for the Civil war. Every member of Lincoln's Cabinet voted no. Lincoln said \"I vote aye. The ayes win.\"\nKennedy obviously knew that as commander in chief he could overrule his advisers when he chose to do so.\nFollowing Kennedys assassination, Lyndon Johnson was either unwilling or unable to overrule his advisers on their repeated calls to escalate the war in Vietnam. Ironically, many of those advisers (except again George Ball) repeatedly advised Johnson for escalation in Vietnam were the same advisers overruled by Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis.\nKaplan's answer to the \"what if\" question on the course of Vietnam war is LBJ plunged deeply into the war and JFK would not have.\nBased on Kaplan's analysis of what if JFK had lived, America would have avoided the great tragedy of a futile and immensely divisive war that resulted in more than 58,000 American deaths and countless veterans returning home with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nI agree.\nDavid Reel is a public relations and public affairs consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The next couple of weeks will either confirm that Joe is the candidate, or another Democrat will rise to the occasion and take on Trump.While the top of the ticket is of immense importance, equally important are the priorities of the party. That is, no matter who the Democratic nominee is, there are certain principles and policies that are more likely to advance and be preserved if Democrats are elected.\nBelow is one person's Top 10 list of reasons why it is imperative to support the eventual Democratic nominee, whomever that may be, as well as Democratic candidates for the Senate and House of Representatives.\nThe Democrats will ...\nDeal with the climate challenges that are impacting our world by supporting clean energy and a phased reduction in fossil fuels.Recognize women's health care as a matter for a woman's conscience, her family, her doctor and her God, not nameless, faceless legislators.Be clear eyed about the existential threats that Russia, China, North Korea and Iran present to the free world.Continue to support our allies particularly Israel and Ukraine through our actions, not blustery promises.Know how important it is to appoint ethical justices to the Supreme Court that best reflect our nation's values so as to not allow further degradations to voting rights, health care options, gun control and climate protections.Continue economic policies that have pushed unemployment to historically low levels, jobs to new heights, spurred growth and managed an economy that continues to be the envy of the world.Be vigilant about future pandemics and rely on science and not conspiracy theories as how to best deal with them. Thousands of people died unnecessarily by a failure to have competent presidential leadership during COVID.Respect the results of elections.Not constantly lie to the American people.Not have four times indicted, twice impeached, convicted felon and serial liar running for commander in chief.\nThe choices are clear for November – support the Democratic nominee for president along with the Democratic ticket. It is too important to stay home.\nVote.\nDENNIS GLACKIN\nSt. Michaels \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "1st District delegates partake in the Republican National Convention\n\n July 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 585\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n MILWAUKEE — Delegates from the Eastern Shore joined thousands of politically active Republicans in Milwaukee Wisconsin for the party's National Convention this week.At the Republican National Convention, which ran from July 15 to 18, delegates selected Donald Trump as the party's nominee for president and J.D. Vance as its nominee for vice president. The GOP also made key decisions about the party's political platform.\nThe Eastern Shore's elected delegates used their time at the convention to learn how the Republican party is prioritizing public safety, stimulating the economy and addressing immigration, according to Julie Giordano, Wicomico County executive.\nGiordano was there as a delegate from Maryland's 1st Congressional District, which encompasses the Eastern Shore as well as Harford and parts of Baltimore counties. With her were fellow 1st District delegates Danielle Hornberger, county executive for Cecil County, and Kathy Szaliga, a member of the House of Delegates representing Baltimore and Harford counties.\nAs county executive and an active part of the Wicomico community, Giordano said federal policies like those discussed at the convention play a crucial role in local communities. She said during her campaign for county executive, she ran on issues concerning public safety, education and the economy, which she says have all been affected by federal policies.\n\"The things that I'm trying to do are affected because of policies made at the federal level,\" Giordano said. \"When I see a change in those federal policies, it then trickles down. It trickles down to the state, and then trickles down to the county.\"\nAmong the many areas of policy raised at the convention, Giordano said public safety was a main topic of discussion.\nThis convention came on the heels of an assassination attempt on Trump during a campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, which happened less than two days before the convention began.\nGiordano said in the aftermath of the assassination attempt, Trump's campaign emphasized the need for unity and policy priorities such as public safety and local economy stimulation.\n\"I do think that there is definitely more of a push for a unified America,\" Giordano said. \"We see it across both sides of the aisle, that President Biden and President Trump both have condemned political violence, and I think that that unifying message is really resonating.\"\nOn the final day of the convention, a much anticipated speech from the former president was given to close out the convention. In his over 90-minute speech Trump accepted the party's nomination, expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support following the assassination attempt and shared his concerns over the \"invasion\" at the Southern border.\nFor Giordano, the issue of immigration hit close to home. She said the schools in the Eastern Shore are overflowing and a lot of the new students are \"the ESL (English as a Second Language) population.\"\n\"It's affecting our schools,\" Giordano said. \"It's affecting our county itself. It affects a lot of different things. And we are all about bringing people here. This is the greatest country on Earth, but they have to do it legally.\"\nAt the end of the convention Giordano said it was an amazing experience and encouraged everybody to become politically involved and partake in events such as the convention.\n\"I don't care if you are a Republican or a Democrat,\" Giordano said. \"If you feel strongly about a candidate, and you get to go and be part of the convention, it is such an amazing experience, because you are around people that think the same way you do and want the same things that you do.\"\nKonner Metz contributed to this story. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

On Monday, the Maryland delegation to the 2024 Democratic National Convention met virtually and voted to endorse Harris.\nKen Ulman, chair for the Maryland Democratic Party, said delegates from the state unanimously agreed on Harris as a candidate. Ulman said it was a \"fairly easy decision\" due to her years of public service and her strong partnership with Biden.\n\"When (Biden) put the country over himself. He endorsed his vice president,\" Ulman said. \"... I think there's such a release of positive energy and momentum behind rallying around a nominee like Kamala Harris and having this vigorous, robust 105-day campaign.\"\nPatrick Firth, chair of Talbot Democrats, said he is excited for Democratic leadership and is working to make sure that in November Talbot County votes blue once more.\n\"In 2020, they (Talbot voters) saw what a Trump administration looked like and for the first time since 1964 voted for the Democratic presidential candidate,\" Firth said. \"And I'm not surprised if Talbot County remembers what happened in the Trump administration's first term and rejects him once more at the ballot box.\"\nJared Schablein, a delegate to the national convention from Wicomico County, said he is excited for Harris' candidacy because of her legislative history in \"fighting climate change,\" because of her work addressing crime as a prosecutor and because she represents politically underrepresented populations in America.\n\"Not only does she have an amazing track record of delivering real results in infrastructure, affordable health care and clean energy jobs,\" Schablein said, \"she also gives representation for communities that have been looking for representation for a very long time. She is going to be our first woman president.\"\nDuring the virtual meeting on Monday, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, the Maryland Democratic Party and the Maryland delegation to the national convention applauded Biden for his history of work in public service, according to a press release from the Maryland Democratic Party.\nAs of Monday afternoon, the Harris campaign said it has raised $81 million in the first 24 hours after Biden dropped out from \"hundreds of thousands of donors,\" about 60% of whom were making their first donation of the 2024 election cycle.\nFor Ulman, he looks forward to focusing on the political values such as abortion, common sense gun safety and investing in education that he says will continue with the Harris campaign.\n\"I think for the next 105 days, we get to have the conversation about the kind of country that we want to live in, and that's a conversation and a debate that I think we're really excited about having,\" Ulman said.\nThe Democratic National Convention will be in Chicago from Aug. 19 to 22. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Personally I think this a pay back to the Ukraine for all the money they gave to the Biden family by way of Hunter over the years.Why do the Democrats despise Israel so much (many are Jewish) and support Hamas? Biden and Harris are not speaking out against the protests, the burning of the American flag, destruction of property, disruption of classrooms, tearing down of statues that represent our American heritage, disruption of free speech by conservatives, they don't adhere to the Constitution and Bill of Rights ... and this is OK with the American people?\nGod's word says, speaking of Israel, \"I will bless those who bless you and I will curse those who curse you.\"\nThis administration has done a lot to go against Israel and a day of reckoning is coming.

Sunday and Monday the electricity in the air was palpable.\nDemocrats around the country woke up and said this is now an election we can win. It is rumored that about 30,000 volunteers signed up at any one of the many Biden-Harris offices opened around the country.\nVice President Harris is a former prosecutor who was elected California attorney general and then to the U.S. Senate before Biden chose her four years ago to be his vice president. Since Roe v. Wade was killed by the Supreme Court two years ago we have seen her spearhead the administration's efforts for women's right to choose.\nShe has represented the U.S. abroad at international conferences and met over 100 heads of state. A letter of support for her foreign policy experience has just been signed by a large number of previous U.S. leaders on foreign policy, including several former chiefs of our intelligence community.\nNow we come to the crux of the discussion.\nIs America ready for a female president? A majority of countries abroad have been expertly led by women. The United Kingdom comes to mind particularly as Queen Elizabeth reigned longer than any man, while twice the Brits elected women prime ministers.\nKamala Harris is 59 years old. Her mother is Shyamala Gopalan, an Indian immigrant and scientist who came to University of California at Berkley to study. She is today a breast cancer researcher. There she met Donald Harris, a Jamaican-American economist and later professor at Stanford University. Kamala Harris is married to Douglas Emhoff who has grown children from a previous marriage. He has resigned from his law firm and devotes his time to support his wife, the vice president.\nAfter listening to the misogynistic (which means according to the Oxford English Dictionary \"a hatred of, or contempt for, or prejudice against women and girls\") speeches by former president Trump, his new vice president, JD Vance, and others at the recent Republican Convention, I concluded that they want to go back to a patriarchal society of say, 75 years ago — the 1950s.\nThe final straw was when they said they planned to eliminate no fault divorces. 69% of such divorces are today initiated by women. Of course, they also want to eliminate all rights that women and others have obtained in the last 75 years. They would be able to do this by declaring Trump a dictator who also will take control of the Department of Justice. The 250-year old democracy of this country would be gone.\nI believe that Kamala Harris is uniquely qualified to take on Donald Trump in this presidential election and win. She is the right woman to stand up to the MAGA misogyny and plans to make the United States into a fascist dictatorship.\nLena Gill lives in Easton and is a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trump criminal enterprise poses for second term\n\n July 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MEL GURTOV | Section: News \n \n 771\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Former FBI director James Comey once compared Donald Trump's gang of loyalists to the Mafia. \"Holy crap, they are trying to make each of us an amica nostra — friend of ours. To draw us in.\"And draw in people Trump did: cabinet members and other officials, campaign workers, lawyers, talking heads at Fox. The very apt comparison with gangster politics played itself out once again at the Republican National Convention.\nThe cast of characters indicted and convicted was worthy of Mafia status, starting of course with the ex-president, a felon. There's Peter Navarro, fresh from his four-month prison term: \"I went to prison so you won't have to,\" Navarro told the audience. \"I am your wake-up call.\" (He got a one-minute standing ovation.)\nThen there are Rudy Giuliani, convicted in the fake electors scheme; and Paul Manafort, pardoned by Trump for his role in the Russia election interference case. (Apparently not attending were Michael Flynn, the disgraced former national security adviser whom Trump pardoned and has promised to bring back; Steve Bannon, who is in jail on contempt of Congress charges; and Roger Stone, Trump's henchman, also pardoned.)\nWe'll probably meet all of these people again if there's a Trump II.\nElection deniers from the states were well represented at the RNC. As reported by NPR, there were three fake electors from Arizona (including two state senators), five from Nevada, three from Georgia and two from Michigan.\nThey are all under federal criminal indictments and required special permission from a judge to travel to Milwaukee.\n\"Election deniers from Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Wisconsin are also present as delegates at the RNC,\" NPR noted. When interviewed, none of these people would acknowledge their illegal acts or false accusations. They were actually all victims of \"political persecution,\" you see.\nAnd let's not forget the blatantly corrupt in attendance, headlined by Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. They used their positions as senior advisers in the Trump administration to make millions of dollars in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Qatar in particular, and in China.\nAnd they're still actively peddling influence. Kushner is engaged in major real estate deals with Serbia and Albania — luxury homes and hotels in resorts made possible by high-level contacts Kushner cultivated earlier. Kushner, Ivanka and Richard Grenell have traveled to the Balkans and met with senior Albanian officials, the New York Times reports. Grenell was an acting director of national intelligence under Trump, ambassador to Germany and special envoy to the Balkans.\nTrump himself continues to invest in the Middle East. Right now, he's involved in a development deal in Oman along with Saudi real estate interests.\nThe Saudis in turn have shown a strong interest in Kushner's Albania projects. This tallies with the key elements of Kushner's portfolio.\nAfter Trump's defeat, Kushner formed an investment firm, Affinity Partners, which has $3 billion in funding, 99 percent from foreign sources: Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund ($2 billion), investors in Qatar ($200 million) and the United Arab Emirates ($200 million), and Foxconn (a leading Taiwan electronics manufacturer). So far, Kushner's firm has invested about $1.2 billion, almost all in companies abroad. It's tag-team corruption.\nAs we all know, all the charges, jail terms and corrupt practices will be history if Trump wins in November. His thoroughly politicized justice department will take care of that.\nOfficial corruption, thanks to the Supreme Court's decision on presidential immunity, will largely vanish as Trump and family erase the line between public and private financial moves. Bribery, for example, need no longer be hidden in dealings with foreign governments, companies and other entities.\nImportant foreign-policy decisions related, for example, to arms sales, multinational corporation investments, technology transfers, social media companies, environmental protection, repression of human rights and U.S. force deployments will be thoroughly transactional. I wonder, for example, what Elon Musk has bought in return for his $45 million a month pledge to a pro-Trump super PAC, or how much environmental deregulation the fossil fuel industry has bought in return for its contributions to Trump's reelection.\nIn short, U.S. foreign and national security policies will have a \"For Sale\" sign out front.\nWhat will not fade away with a Trump win is the national embarrassment of having a criminal gang represent the United States abroad and in international organizations. Of course, that will hardly matter to autocratic governments, but it might well generate considerable mistrust among democracies.\nAfter all, if a U.S. decision is open to the highest bidder, and if the president is above the law and has a long history of fraudulent behavior, how good is the word of the United States of America?\nMel Gurtov, syndicated by PeaceVoice, is professor emeritus of political science at Portland State University. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Decline of civil dialog in society is a threat\n\n July 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 753\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Every Sunday when I was a child, we eagerly awaited the delivery of the Sunday newspaper. It always included a feature with riveting pictures from previous editions.They were not just a collage of all the pictures from previous editions.\nThey were selected by the newspaper's editors thinking not so much on how timely they were at the present, but how timeless they might be going forward.\nIf that program were still in place today, two pictures that most certainly would be selected would be from the 2024 presidential election campaign.\nOne is of former President and current presidential candidate Donald Trump after an attempted assassination at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\nIn that surreal picture, Trump is being taken with a bloody hand on a wounded ear, blood on his face and his other hand raised as a defiant fist from the event stage by Secret Service agents.\nAnother picture would be from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\nIn that picture, Trump is standing alone on a stage next to the helmet and bunker coat of Corey Comperatore, who was a volunteer firefighter and Trump supporter who attended the Pennsylvania rally.\nCorey died shielding his family from the fusillade that almost killed Trump and seriously wounded two other rally attendees.\nProminently displayed next to Corey's bunker coat and helmet is an American flag.\nTrump appears to be gazing with deep contemplation of and reverence for the memorial for Comperatore.\nIn deeply divided America, both pictures are generating widely different reactions.\nSome Trump detractors claim the assassination was preplanned to generate support for the Trump campaign. They have implied Trump exiting the stage largely under his own power was done to show a stark contrast to a former opponent who often stumbled and needed assistance while walking.\nSome Trump detractors claim the picture of Trump looking at the Comperatore's memorial was staged for nothing more than scoring political points. They question if Trump's hand on the shoulder of the turnout coat was orchestrated and insincere.\nSadly, a significant number of seriously deranged Trump adversaries have posted messages on social media with messages like \"sorry the shooter missed\" and \"hope he [Trump] is killed the next time.\"\nI found the vileness and hate in those messages so disturbing I couldn't read all of them.\nNot all those adversaries are radical fringe malcontents.\nThey include a wide range of elected officials, celebrities and political commentators who have regularly characterized and continue to characterize Donald Trump as a Nazi, a neo-Nazi, a fascist, a dictator wanna be and an existential threat to America.\nSome Trump supporters believe the attempted assassination was a deep state conspiracy.\nThey maintain the spectacular failure of security at the event was by design.\nThey also believe constant inflammatory comments from Trump's many adversaries created an environment where the question on an assassination attempt was not if, but when.\nI am not going to engage a debate on the credibility on either side on these deeply held beliefs.\nI am more concerned such debate affirms that an alarming and steady decline of civil dialogue in our society is the greatest existential threat to democracy in America.\nIn today's intensely polarized political environment, it is considered normal and acceptable to disagree by being viciously disagreeable, to listen only to those who share and affirm that their views are the right views. Worst of all, we expect and accept the practice of demonizing anyone, and everyone who doesn't agree with us on every issue all the time.\nWe desperately need a renewed national commitment to critical thinking, listening to others, avoiding group think, respect for differing opinions and acceptance of a system of government where the majority rules, even when that can and does result in public policy decisions that do not have universal agreement.\nMuch easier said than done.\nThe underlying reality of where we are as a society is best captured by the cogent observation of veteran political communications consultant, Frank Luntz: \"It's not what you say or write, it's what people hear or read. You can have the best message in the world, but the person on the receiving end will always understand it through the prism of their own emotions, preconceptions, prejudices and preexisting beliefs.\"\nIn other words — my mind is made up. Don't try to persuade me otherwise with facts.\nWhen dealing the deep divisions caused by the issue of slavery and the American Civil War Abraham Lincoln said, \"A house divided cannot stand.\"\nAmerica has been and is a house divided.\nIf we do not change course soon, we will not stand.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "author": "DAVID REEL",
    "content": "Messages did not match what we saw in debate\n\n August 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 903\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In one memorable scene in the classic Marx Brothers comedy movie Duck Soup, Chico Marx asks a skeptical costar: \"Well, who you gonna believe, me or your own eyes?\"In the movie, that was funny. In real life it is not.\nIn the 2024 presidential election, there have been several pivotal events with many more likely.\nOne of the most consequential pivotable events was the June 27 presidential debate.\nIn a world where consensus in the political arena is an increasingly rare occurrence, there is almost universal consensus that President Biden's debate performance was very poor. The reasons given were simply not credible and made a bad situation for President Biden worse.\nEven before the debate was held there were questions over Mr. Biden's physical and mental ability to serve a second term. After the debate, that issue was largely settled.\nDespite efforts by his campaign staff, White House staff, his family and a substantial number of his supporters to explain away or minimize Biden's debate performance as a one-off experience, that debate ignited a political firestorm. In relatively short order, there was a massive and measurable drop off in public support, donor support, and Democratic Party support for Biden.\nThat ultimately led to Biden's sudden and unexpected July 21 announcement that he was withdrawing from seeking re-election. The aftershocks from that decision are still being felt.\nQuestions are still being raised about the timing of his announcement and his ability to perform the duties of his office until his term ends in January.\nI suggest there are two much larger questions that should not and cannot be ignored.\nOne is who to trust going forward on campaign messages from former Biden supporters who vigorously defended him until they suddenly chose not to defend him.\nVoters need to know what did former Biden supporters know and when did they know it?\nAre we going to trust President Biden's White House staff or his former campaign staff? Are we to going to trust the many elected officials who steadfastly maintained Biden was physically and mentally healthy and deserved re-election? Are we going to trust any members of the President's cabinet who, to a person, publicly and unequivocally maintained that he was doing an excellent job? Are we to going to trust the vice president?\nAll of them have varying degrees of culpability in denying or minimizing suggestions from anyone who expressed concerns on the steady deterioration of President Biden's mental and physical health.\nPerhaps most troubling, are the reasons given by so many of President Biden's supporters just before he suddenly stepped down from his re-election bid.\nThey said he needed to step down because he could not win re-election. They also said his candidacy would hurt Democratic candidates in competitive U.S. House and U.S Senate races.\nWhat they were really saying was keeping him in office was more important than an honest appraisal of his ability to effectively perform in what is the most challenging and consequential job in the world.\nIn almost every post-debate poll, large numbers of the American public (Democrats, Republicans and Independents) did not feel Joe Biden should run for a second term.\nThey did so after they watched, listened to or read about President Biden's debate performance. They decided they could no longer believe all they were told pre-debate, but did believe what they personally saw, heard or read about his performance at the debate.\nOnly when polling showed a drastic collapse in voter confidence in President Biden, did his longtime supporters and the much of the media decide it was time for a new candidate. These longtime supporters were all in on him running for re-election until they were all in on him not running for re-election.\nAmericans need to know who promoted and allowed an elderly and increasingly ill person who is clearly in need of help and compassion, to become a shell of his former self.\nJust as importantly, Americans need to know why? Did they want and need a malleable person in the Oval Office to take and execute orders without questioning or even fully understanding them?\nTheir actions were nothing less than elder abuse and were a grave disservice to America.\nRegarding a once robust elderly person's irreversible mental and physical decline, I have personal experience as do countless others with aging family members. My father suffered from the ravages of dementia for almost 10 years prior to his death. His mental decline was not subtle or slow. His family did not need a physician to confirm what was obvious.\nWe knew early in his decline he needed to be placed under medical care to prevent him from causing serious harm to himself and to others. As is often the case with dementia, he did not realize that reality and fought us regularly on any suggestions that he needed to leave his home to be in an assisted living facility. We prevailed. As difficult as it was, we knew it was the right thing to do and we did what needed to be done, when it needed to be done.\nThe lesson learned is simple.\nBetween now and the November election, be very suspicious of any messages from those who were not forthright in their previous and often disdainful responses to countless concerns raised about President Biden's health issues. We now know their previous messages simply did not match what many of us saw with our own eyes before and during the June 27 debate.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Statesmanship has become too rare in Congress\n\n August 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LARRY HOGAN | Section: Columns \n \n 721\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n This week marks seven years since Sen. John McCain's (R-Ariz.) historic vote to save Obamacare. I will never forget a phone call I had with him just moments before he gave the big thumbs down on the Senate floor. He was reaching out about a statement I had issued opposing the Republicans' effort to repeal Obamacare. He thanked me for putting people over party and confidentially let me know he was going to do the same.Although we shared the same concern that our health care system desperately needs commonsense reforms to lower costs, McCain and I both knew that the Republican bill to repeal Obamacare was irresponsible and would jeopardize the health care coverage for our citizens.\nAs McCain told me that day, his vote was about far more than just Obamacare. While he was courageously battling brain cancer, he wanted to send a message to his colleagues and the nation that the broken status quo in Washington could not continue. In a speech later that day, he appealed that the Senate was being weighed down by partisan dysfunction and was on the \"decline.\"\nCan anyone dispute that the problem has grown far worse since McCain spoke those words seven years ago? Our political discourse is spiraling into rabid tribalism, hatred and violence. Politicians in Washington care more about appealing to the loudest and angriest voices than actually delivering for the people they serve. They are \"trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.\" Ultimately, the losers of all this partisan dysfunction are the American people.\nIt wasn't always this way.\nAs McCain said: \"I've known and admired men and women in the Senate who played much more than a small role in our history, true statesmen, giants of American politics. They came from both parties and from various backgrounds.\"\nLast week, I had the honor of attending a memorial service to remember one of those giants: Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.). Though they were on different sides of the aisle, Lieberman and McCain were true friends who both loved this country and worked together on countless issues for the good of the nation.\nWhen my father Larry Hogan Sr. served in Congress, he would debate about real issues with his colleagues across the aisle then sit down and actually get things done. Fifty years ago this week, he put aside partisanship and answered the demands of his conscience to do what he thought was the right thing for the state and nation that he loved, becoming the first Republican to come out for the impeachment of President Nixon.\nThis type of statesmanship has become far too rare. Increasingly, principled leaders who care more about making the Senate work for their constituents than their Twitter accounts are heading for the exits. Instead of serving as \"an important check on the powers of the Executive\" and working together to advance commonsense solutions, politicians in the Senate toe the party line and perpetuate the broken status quo to advance their careers.\nEvery election cycle, partisans on both sides of the aisle tell the American people that the only answer is just to vote straight party line regardless of the character and experience of the candidates. And every election cycle, our politics becomes even more divisive and dysfunctional as a result.\nThe only way we can fix this mess is to elect independent leaders who are not beholden to the broken system. I don't need a job or another title. I am running to be a completely different kind of senator. As a key swing vote who has never hesitated to stand up to my party, both parties will have to earn my support.\nOnly Maryland can count on my vote. That independence will give me an outsized influence to stand up for what is right, put Maryland at the center of every deal, and help make the Senate work again for the people.\nThis isn't just the typical fight between Democrats and Republicans. It's more important than that. This is a fight for America's future, and that is a fight worth fighting. McCain knew the truth: \"The success of the Senate is important to the continued success of America … That responsibility is more important than any of our personal interests or political affiliations.\"\nFormer Gov. Larry Hogan is the Republican nominee for the open U.S. Senate seat in Maryland. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

We don't want the public to tune out credible charges against a candidate because the dialogue and attacks seem unbearably disgusting on both sides.\nThe purpose of civil dialogue is to get at the truth, even if impolite and disturbing. Reel fails to distinguish between irresponsible accusations that are false, and distasteful accusations that are true.\nReel properly criticizes Democratic extremists who questioned whether an assassin's bullet actually hit Trump. Such speculation is contemptible, as is JD Vance's assertion that Joe Biden's rhetoric \"led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination.\"\nRepublican candidates make unprecedented, wildly irresponsible and easily refutable claims. Calling Kamala Harris a \"bum,\" or using terms like \"crooked Joe Biden\" and the \"Biden crime family\" is despicable. So is denying that Biden was elected president and calling the assault on the Capitol a peaceful event.\nCalls for civil discourse should not shield candidates from serious charges that are true. Mr. Reel provides the perfect example. He lumps claims by Democrats that Trump is a threat to democracy together with the rest of the derogatory and false attacks on both sides. However, more than a dozen of Trump's former officials make the same accusation.\nJohn Kelly, Trump's former chief of staff, said Trump \"has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution and the rule of law.\"\nFormer Defense Secretary James Mattis said of Trump, \"We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution.\"\nMark Esper, Trump's former defense secretary, said of Trump, \"He's a threat to democracy as we know it.\"\nEven Mike Pence refuses to endorse Trump.\nCalls for civil discourse should not throw out true accusations, however distasteful.\nJIM BRUCE\nSt. Michaels \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Harris VP pick lauded by Dems, scorned by GOP\n\n August 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KATHARINE WILSON Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 791\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris' choice of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday won praise from Maryland Democrats, who pointed to the governor's experience and approach to politics as key assets in the fall campaign.Maryland Republicans, with one notable exception, saw little to like in the final piece of the Democratic ticket that will face off against former President Donald Trump and his vice presidential choice, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance.\nRep. Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland) said in a statement that Democrats and other voters should be excited for his friend Walz, whom he called an invaluable member of the House Democratic Caucus during his time in Congress.\n\"His plainspoken, common-sense approach to governing allowed him to deliver for veterans and Minnesotans,\" Hoyer said. \"I know he will bring that same dedication and empathy to the vice presidency.\"\nWalz served in the House from 2007 until January 2019, when he became Minnesota's governor. He was reelected in 2022.\nHarris' decision on her running mate came hours after she officially became the Democratic Party's nominee for the presidency, clinching the vote of 99% of delegates in a virtual roll call. Walz and Harris are set to start a battleground state tour together this week, debuting Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\nBefore his political career, Walz was a high school teacher, football coach and command sergeant major in the Army National Guard.\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, highlighted fellow Democrat and veteran Walz's experience in the Army and his \"proven track record of progress\" in a Tuesday post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\"His incredible journey of service … isn't just a source of inspiration for future generations and evidence of his deep commitment to this country; it's also proof of his effectiveness as a leader who is going to generate wins not just for the Democratic Party in November, but for the entire country,\" Moore said.\n\"To the window ... to the Walz!!!\" the Maryland Democratic Party tweeted, inviting Maryland residents to sign a card welcoming the governor to the campaign.\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D–Maryland, called Walz \"a rock star to veterans, teachers, football players and common-sense Americans.\"\nPrince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who is the Democratic candidate for the Senate, said in a statement that the Harris-Walz ticket presents a vision that stands \"in diametric opposition\" to the Trump-Vance ticket and is instead focused on protecting freedoms.\n\"I couldn't be more excited for Vice President Harris, for Maryland, and for our country in her decision of Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate,\" Alsobrooks said.\nWalz signed numerous pieces of LGBTQ+ protection legislation throughout his governorship including bills that protected gender-affirming care, banned book bans due to LGBTQ+ content and banned conversion therapy. The governor also signed bills protecting abortion in Minnesota and people who travel to Minnesota for the procedure.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, who served with the governor in Congress, said there was no better person to serve alongside Harris.\n\"Tim has always put our country first,\" Van Hollen said in a statement. \"I'm excited and ready to do everything I can to turn out the vote and elect President Harris and Vice President Walz — a brighter future for all Americans and our democracy depends on it.\"\nSen. Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) kept his endorsement succinct, posting on X: \"Harris-Walz. Strong. Experienced. Authentic. Unifying. Exciting! Can't wait to cast my ballot.\"\nRep. Andy Harris, the sole Republican in the Maryland congressional delegation, joined other party members in accusing Walz on X of being \"pro-open border\" and repeating the false claim that Harris is the \"border czar.\"\n\"It is no surprise failed Border Czar Kamala Harris picked a running mate who is more pro-open border than she is,\" Andy Harris tweeted. \"The same person who said he would invest in a ladder factory to defeat Trump's border wall is now vying to be VP.\"\nWalz was critical of Trump's border wall proposal, supported a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and signed a law that allows undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses.\n\"The selection of Tim Walz as the Democrat candidate for vice president just confirms what we already knew: this is the most extreme, far-left ticket in modern American history,\" the Maryland Republican Party said in a statement.\nHowever, Republican Senate candidate and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan struck a different tone than his GOP counterparts. Hogan congratulated Walz on X and said the country needs more governors on the national level because \"governors have to actually get stuff done.\"\n\"While we come from different parties, I have always appreciated his dedication to public service,\" Hogan said, acknowledging their past working together as governors.\nHogan is in an awkward place in his own party, whose national convention in Milwaukee he skipped last month. He has said he will not support Trump, even though the former president has endorsed him. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They have included assumptions about my background and motivations. As a result, they have a perception that I am using the commentaries to promote the Republican Party in general, and Donald Trump in particular.Such assumptions and perceptions are simply not true.\nI am not an avid supporter of Donald Trump in his comeback bid for another term as president and have not been an avid supporter of him since he launched his first presidential campaign.\nIn one guest commentary last fall I even predicted he would not be nominated as the 2024 Republican presidential candidate.\nI am not an avid supporter of the Republican Party and have never been a blindly loyal voter for Republican candidates.\nBeginning with the first election when I was eligible to vote, and continuing to today, I have never voted a straight Republican ticket in any local, state or national election.\nCandidate quality always has been and will always be my guiding principle on who to support and for whom to cast my vote.\nAt one time I was active in the Republican Party. I served as chair of the Republican Central Committee of Talbot County and as a member of the executive committee at the Maryland Republican Party.\nI voluntarily stepped down as Talbot County Central Committee chair in February 2022. That resulted in my relinquishing my seat on the GOP's executive committee.\nMy past service with the local and state Republican Party is old history and irrelevant to today.\nSince February 2022, I have not had any conversations or dealings with either organization.\nWith regards to the upcoming presidential election, I acknowledge that Donald Trump has flaws. So does Kamala Harris.\nThat said, I embrace the observation of Don Nielson the author of \"Presidential Leadership: Learning from United States Presidential Libraries & Museums.\"\nNielson writes, \"… leaders are not perfect. Try as they might, every leader still has flaws. They still make mistakes. They still fall short. They still have regrets. They still yearn to do better. Every leader is imperfect.\"\nOn at least two occasions I have written positive commentaries about a Democratic leader.\nIn one I praised Democratic President John F. Kennedy for his masterful leadership during the Cuban Missile crisis. His leadership has led many historians to conclude his actions avoided World War III.\nIn another guest commentary on President Kennedy, I suggested voters everywhere should embrace his timeless admonition to always ask this question — \"What am I not being told?\"\nIn all my commentaries, I strive to engage independent thinking and to follow lessons learned about bipartisanship from two awesome political mentors.\nOne was a Republican state senator in Pennsylvania for whom I served as his administrative assistant. Our office received more constituent requests for assistance than any other senator.\nHis ironclad rule was to help everyone regardless of their party affiliation, relative level of support or lack of support for him or their views on the issues. We never researched or even considered that information before we worked diligently on every constituent contact on every matter regardless of how small or how big.\nA second mentor is the CEO of a Pennsylvania-based public affairs and public relations consulting firm where I serve as Maryland director.\nFor almost 45 years, this mentor, a staunch Republican, was a close friend of a long time equally staunch Democratic political operative in Pennsylvania.\nHis friend served as the executive director of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, as a communications director for two Democratic governors, and as a communications director for two Democratic speakers of the House in the state House of Representatives.\nFor over 20 years, my mentor and his friend were verbal sparring partners on a weekly point-counterpoint television program. They also sparred in point-counterpoint columns for two publications and frequently shared the stage at conferences, seminars and classrooms. Many times, they rode together to and from those events.\nIn a city mayoral election, my mentor provided campaign counsel to a Democratic candidate because he felt strongly that she was the best person for the job.\nLast, but not least, my mentor hosts a monthly policy briefing at our office in Pennsylvania.\nOn a regular basis, Democratic-elected officials, Democratic candidates and Democratic party operatives are featured as speakers and are welcomed as guests.\nGoing forward I will continue to offer my thoughts based upon a lifetime of participating in and observing a wide range of events in the political arena.\nI will continue to respect the right of those who choose to disagree, sometimes vehemently, with the central messages in my commentaries.\nI will continue to read every comment, pro and con, on my commentaries with a willingness to think, \"You may be right.\"\nIn return, I ask all who disagree with me to do this:\nRefrain from attacking my opinions using unsubstantiated assumptions about my background and motives.\nFocus more on my content, staying on topic and giving due thought and consideration to that content, rather than trying to attack the messenger.\nRemember two former and greatly missed U.S. Supreme Court Justices — conservative icon Antonin Scalia and liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsberg. They were polar opposites on their opinions on almost every issue brought before the court. Still, they respected each other and never attacked each other. Justice Scalia said it best, \"I attack ideas. I don't attack people.\"\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gov. Larry Hogan: A pragmatic difference maker\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DARIN THACKER | Section: Columns \n \n 557\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last year's Christmas break was memorable for me, and not just because of the special time with family.As someone who was raised in Lusby and currently works for a U.S. senator, I was motivated to encourage former Gov. Larry Hogan to seek Maryland's open seat in the U.S. Senate. I believe he's a generational leader whose service in the Senate would greatly benefit Maryland and the country, so I used my time off to write him a personal letter to make my appeal.\nGov. Hogan kindly responded by inviting me to meet with him a week later where I continued my pitch. It was ultimately the chronic dysfunction of the Senate, and specifically its failure in early February to strengthen our nation's border security and immigration laws, that drove him to run. But I'm grateful that a heartfelt letter helped trigger his consideration.\nMy Senate experience gives me confidence that Gov. Hogan would be very effective for Maryland and stand against the extremes of both parties, regardless of who holds the majority in the Senate or wins the White House.\nSenators tend to fall into two camps: Partisan ideologues and pragmatic difference makers. Ideologues push their unrealistic, and oftentimes extreme, policy agendas. They take actions that cause constituents with diverse viewpoints to run to their corners, not solve problems. They almost always vote the party line and perpetuate division and gridlock. Their record of legislative achievements is thin.\nSenators who are difference makers are the exact opposite. They are principled but practical. They seek bipartisan solutions and recognize that meaningful progress often comes in incremental steps. They acknowledge that members from both parties have good ideas. And they embrace the counsel of former President Barack Obama who said, \"No one is exempt from the call to find common ground.\"\nLarry Hogan is a proven difference maker. As governor Marylanders saw him work across the aisle to strengthen our economy and make our communities safer. He went to every corner of the state, worked with folks of every ethnicity and economic status and locked arms with local leaders from every party to get things done.\nAs a result he left office with a 77% approval rating — including a remarkable 81% approval rating among Democrats.\nFurther, Gov. Hogan would have an outsized influence among his Senate colleagues. Senate rules require 60 votes to pass most bills, which means Hogan would be at the center of finding bipartisan solutions on every major issue. He would also help defeat fringe legislation and judges from both parties. Contrary to the claims of Gov. Hogan's partisan opponents, Marylanders would be well served to have a senator who works from the political center to forge consensus and protect mainstream values.\nIn short, I believe Gov. Hogan's independent leadership is exactly what the Senate needs as it confronts the enormous challenges facing our country. He has a proven record of bipartisan achievement in Annapolis, and I have no doubt Gov. Hogan would continue to put country above party while representing Maryland across Route 50 in our nation's capital.\nAnd if Marylanders do elect him in November, this year's Christmas break will end with something even more memorable for me than last's — Gov. Hogan taking the oath of office as U.S. senator.\nDarin Thacker is chief of staff for U.S. Senator Steve Daines of Montana.

The letter writer makes no mention at all of policy issues that should be the real basis for supporting a presidential candidate. Do taxpayers care more about \"cheerfulness\" than the increasing taxes they pay? Do they care more about a president being \"energetic\" than the energy shown by millions of illegal trespassers breaking into our country? What is \"wise\" about not standing up for the best education possible for the \"young\" people supposedly being represented?\nPersonality traits like those mentioned above are what we look for in friends and neighbors but should not be the primary attributes to look for in a president. They should be subordinate to what actions a president is likely to take in matters that are important to the nation's safety and overall quality of life. Fortunately, for most political candidates there is more tangible evidence along these lines than there is about someone's social character.\nDon't be fooled by what a person reads from a teleprompter or how they are described in the media. Take time to find out what decisions they made in office and whether you agree with them or not. Personality is what we want in family and friends; policy is what we want in a president.\nART CECIL\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Tim Walz.Gov. Wes Moore, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, U.S. Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks and U.S. Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen are among the group's most prominent political figures. Other Marylanders are making their debuts as delegates to the DNC.\nMoore, who is expected to address the full convention this week, told reporters on a virtual press call Sunday that he's going to be busy this week talking to veterans, young voters and other groups.\n\"I think the thing that I want people to know is that this is the campaign that's actually bringing joy into this race,\" Moore said. \"This is the campaign that's bringing unity into this race, and this is the campaign that actually believes in partnership to be able to produce the kind of results that people are hoping for.\"\nAll Maryland delegates are pledged to Harris, the Democrats' nominee who will be ceremonially nominated this week at the convention and whose campaign has galvanized the party since President Joe Biden withdrew on July 21.\n\"We're going to be energized, excited,\" Maryland Democratic Party Chairman Ken Ulman told Capital News Service. \"We're going to come out of Chicago. It's going to be Labor Day, and boom — we've got a two month sprint. So I think it's easier now to keep the momentum than in most campaigns.\"\nThe Maryland contingent at the convention is expected to include the following people:\n63 pledged district-level delegates.8 alternate delegates.21 at-large delegates.7 members of the Maryland congressional delegation.12 Democratic National Committee members.11 other party leaders and elected officials.\nUlman said he was looking forward to the convention, which convenes Monday and will culminate Thursday with Harris' acceptance speech.\n\"Excited, motivated, uplifted,\" Ulman said when asked what he hopes that Maryland voters get from the convention. \"It's going to be refreshing after seeing a party that just tears people down,\" he continued, referring to the Republican Party.\nUlman, 50, will be serving as chair for the Maryland Democrats for the first time. Ulman is the former Howard County executive and worked for former Gov. Parris N. Glendening. When Moore came into office in 2023, he asked Ulman to serve as chair of the party.\n\"For me, this is actually a full-circle moment, going to Chicago for the convention,\" Ulman said.\nTwo years into his political career, at 22, Ulman worked the 1996 Democratic National Convention, also held in Chicago.\nHeading into the week, Ulman said he is not worried about the campaign peaking early.\n\"I'm focused on making sure we sustain the momentum,\" he said. \"It's actually a wonderful thing that this came together when it did, because, as Walz said, 'you can do anything for 90 days.'\"\nA first-timer to the convention is Sheree Sample-Hughes. After serving as a member of the Electoral College last election cycle, Sample-Hughes is representing Maryland's 1st Congressional District. She is a state delegate representing Dorchester and Wicomico counties.\nSample-Hughes said that the Harris-Walz campaign must prioritize solutions to problems. She said she expects Democrats to demonstrate a \"unified front\" at this year's convention.\n\"(Voters) want health care addressed at a national level and state level and local level,\" Sample-Hughes said. \"They want economic stability, those types of things. … My point is that a unified front is necessary as we move through this election and re-energize the base, but at the same time, let people see that the United States is one that we should, and continue to be proud of.\"\nUlman, the chairman of the Maryland Democrats, said that the Maryland party has a ground game that has already been \"unleashed\" and will continue after the convention to keep the momentum in the state. The party is opening field offices across the state and organizers are knocking on doors, including in the Eastern Shore and Western Maryland, where Ulman said Democrats typically don't canvas.\nAccording to Ulman, Marylanders will turn out to the polls in November not just for the presidential ticket, but also for congressional races and a ballot measure to amend the Maryland Constitution to protect abortion.\nAn additional issue on the minds of Maryland's delegates to the DNC is the economy.\n\"Maryland isn't the only state that's dealing with this issue of housing,\" said Adrian Boafo, who was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 2023. \"Folks who want more wages, folks who want better health care. A lot of the things I just mentioned are all federal policy. It's why you see people excited about mobilizing around the vice president and Governor Walz in this moment. But I think the economy is on top, the top of mind for everybody right now.\"\nBoafo, elected as a delegate from Maryland's 5th congressional district, is attending his first convention. He intended to go to the 2020 convention with Hoyer, who he worked for as campaign manager at the time, but the gathering was mostly virtual due to the COVID pandemic.\nThe group originally expected all seven Democratic U.S. House members, but Rep. David Trone is traveling overseas and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger will also not be in attendance, according to their offices.\nRep. Steny Hoyer, who sustained a mild stroke on Aug. 11, still will be in attendance, according to his deputy chief of staff, Margaret Mulkerrin.\nEmily R. Condon, James Matheson, Caley Fox Shannon, Daniel Stein and Katharine Wilson contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland Delegates represent at the Democratic National Convention\n\n August 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 531\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHICAGO — Delegates from the Eastern Shore joined thousands of Democrats in Chicago for the Democratic National Convention this week.At the convention, which ran from Aug. 19 to 22, delegates selected Kamala Harris as the party's nominee for president and Tim Walz as its nominee for vice president. The Democratic party also made key decisions about the party's political platform.\nJared Schablein, an Eastern Shore delegate and chair of Shore Progress, said he was more than happy to have Walz as the vice presidential candidate.\n\"The Eastern Shore delegation is excited to see rural representation on the Harris-Walz ticket with Coach Tim Walz,\" he said. \"You know, people are excited for a new generation of leadership that is committed to protecting our freedoms and really investing in middle-class families.\"\nSchablein was there as a delegate from Maryland's 1st Congressional District, which encompasses the Eastern Shore, as well as Harford and parts of Baltimore counties. He said it was important to support a candidate that focused on issues affecting the Eastern Shore, such as affordable housing, expanding healthcare access and raising the minimum wage.\n\"This ticket is focused on letting people make their own choices in life, whether that's their own healthcare choices, whether that is their own choice in who they love, their own choice on when and how to start a family,\" Schablein said. \"This ticket is about freedom, and I'm excited to go back to the Eastern Shore.\"\nSchablein said he was happy to represent the Eastern Shore and even brought a plush muskrat named Earl to help bring attention to the area.\nLillia Rose, a delegate from Maryland's 6th Congressional District, which encompasses Allegany, Garrett and Washington counties and parts of Frederick and Montgomery counties, also hoped to draw attention to rural communities during the convention.\nRose said she loved the chance to participate in the rural caucuses that were offered at the DNC. She said it was great to learn how similar communities are motivating voters in areas that typically lean red.\nRose said listening to climate change activists representing Appalachia was one of her favorite parts of the convention.\n\"I was also really excited to hear about climate justice,\" Rose said. \"That's an issue we've always had and proportionately affected by natural resource extraction, and it can kind of feel hopeless at times. And being a young person, you know, it sounds crazy, but I'm not thinking about myself. I'm thinking about my little cousins and saying 'what can I do now?'\"\nAlongside climate justice, a key issue for Rose was rural women's healthcare accessibility.\n\"These rural issues, where healthcare accessibility can be a huge challenge, whether that's because of lack of transportation, or just distances,\" Rose said. \"… It gives me a lot of hope that people are going to be able to live in the areas they live in, and receive the care they deserve, especially women's health care.\"\nAt the end of the convention, Schablein said it was a great experience and he is excited to bring what he learned back home.\n\"The big slogan from this convention has been that we respect our neighbors, to make their own decisions and we disagree with them, even if we wouldn't make those decisions ourselves,\" Schablein said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Project 2025 offers glimpse at a Trump presidency\n\n August 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LARRY PIFER | Section: Columns \n \n 456\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I recently saw a quote, \"Democracy is earned not given.\" I believe that we have the rare opportunity to earn our democracy in the elections in November. Kamala Harris offers us that chance. She believes in our democracy and in all the things that are a part of it. Freedom to vote, freedom to worship as we wish, freedom to speak what we wish, our own personal freedom, as well as life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.This is what most Americans believe. Donald Trump's record and rhetoric suggest he will not uphold those principles if elected.\nKamala Harris brings youth, enthusiasm, energy, wisdom and experience to making sure that our American democracy continues to flourish and strengthen. Under her leadership we will earn that right to democracy in a time when it is under assault.\nDonald Trump has told us that he will be a dictator in his first day in office. He is a convicted felon. His conservative supporters have drafted a 900-page manifesto called Project 2025, although Trump says, \"I have no idea who is behind it.\" That plan would expand the power of the president so that he is akin to a king.\nProject 2025 asserts that the entire executive branch should be under the direct control of the president. Project 2025 also proposes reclassifying thousands of federal civil service jobs as political appointments to substitute people loyal only to the president. Legal experts have said that Project 2025 would undermine the rule of law, separation of powers, separation of church and state and civil liberties.\nProject 2025 also calls for abolishing the Department of Education, eliminating diversity programs, weakening EPA, halting student loan forgiveness and ending protection for nonbinary and transgender student. Take the time to read for yourself what Project 2025 proposes by googling Project 2025. There are printable pdf summaries available online with all the details you need to know, as well as critiques.\nOther than these statements from Project 2025 attacking the foundations of our democracy it is hard to find any policy statements or consistent principles from Trump himself. Anyone who has changed their political party five times, as Trump has, is a political weathervane, not a consistent leader. I don't think he shares our beliefs in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Kamala Harris does hold those ideals as a part of what she says, what she believes and what she will do. Trump offers only nastiness, name calling, rudeness and hate in his rhetoric and nothing to America that preserves and protects our democracy.\nKamala Harris gives us the chance to save and earn once again our democracy, we must support her. Vote.\nLarry Pifer is a resident of Easton and is a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pelosi, Biden: A fractured political friendship\n\n August 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 687\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Since President Biden withdrew from seeking re-election in late July, there has been speculation about the individual or individuals most responsible for that happening.On a nationally televised address, Biden said, in part, \"So, I've decided the best way forward, is to pass the torch to a new generation.\"\nThat announcement followed a series of Biden's emphatic denials that he would step down from running for a second term despite almost universal agreement that his debate performance against Donald Trump was a disaster.\nOn June 28, Biden acknowledged his poor debate performance but vowed to \"fight on.\"On July 5, Biden said, \"If the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I'd get out of the race. The Lord Almighty's not comin' down.\"On July 8, Biden said, \"I'm not going anywhere.\"On July 11, Biden said, \"It's essentially a toss-up race.\"On July 21, Biden announces he is leaving the presidential race.\nSince then, there has been widespread speculation on the role of Nancy Pelosi on this outcome. Despite no longer serving as speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi is proof that power and influence in politics is not always based on a position.\nSome believe strongly that Pelosi played a key role, if not the key role in convincing Biden to abandon his re-election campaign.\nWhen asked if she helped apply pressure on Biden, Pelosi initially responded with, \"I didn't call one person.\" She later acknowledged she did make a call to one person and that was President Biden. On that call she opined that based on polling his re-election prospects were dismal and that would have significant negative impacts on Democratic candidates in competitive down ballot races.\nShe has also admitted she took calls from key Democratic Party power brokers and opinion leaders where she expressed the same concerns she raised on her call with Biden.\nWhen Nancy Pelosi talks about politics, most people listen. When she doesn't talk, most people notice her silence especially on matters like the viability of a Biden bid for a second term.\nNow that Biden has stepped down from running, she has been somewhat more forthright.\nAt a recent roundtable with reporters, she still insisted she did not lead a behind-the-scenes effort to pressure President Biden to drop his re-election bid. The operative word here is \"lead.\" While she may not have led those behind-the-scenes efforts there is increasing evidence she was very involved in them.\nLike so many past and present events in politics, we may never get the full story.\nWe do know that this chain of events reinforces the brutal reality of politics. Whenever a candidate becomes unelectable, they become expendable.\nUltimately, who Pelosi called or did not call, did or did take calls from, exactly what was said or not said on any of those calls, a mission she was involved to some degree to replace Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee became mission accomplished.\nAchieving that mission formerly viewed by many as \"mission impossible\" has been a game changer in the 2024 presidential election and beyond. It has energized, galvanized, and mobilized a previously despondent Democratic Party. It increases the odds for Democrats to control at least one or both houses of Congress starting next year.\nIt has also forced the Trump campaign to explore adjustments to a campaign strategy that did not ask the question — what if Biden is not the opponent?\nThis change is not without some residual turbulence in the Democratic Party.\nPolitico recently reported Biden is angry with Nancy Pelosi. Their report includes the following quote from an anonymous senior White House official: \"Biden views Pelosi as 'ruthless' and willing to set aside long-term relationships in order to keep her party in power.\"\nAs a result, Pelosi has said she and Biden have not spoken since July 19.\nBased on the late scheduling and even later delivery of Biden's speech at the DNC convention it is clear the Democratic Party has no time for him going forward.\nI suggest Joe Biden needs to heed advice attributed to former Democratic President Harry Truman: \"If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.\"\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Lemuel Dent Jr. will be interred on Sept. 5 at Cheltenham Veterans Cemetery in Prince George's County. Johnson Funeral Services of White Plains will perform graveside services preceding the interment.\nA native of Ironsides, an area on Route 6 in Charles County, Dent was assigned to Company L, 3rd Battalion, 366th Infantry Regiment, 92nd Infantry Division, known as the \"Buffalo Soldiers\" in the European Theater. The U.S. Army combat unit was made up for Black soldiers.\nDent was killed Feb. 8, 1945, at age 30, near the Cinquale Canal, north of Viareggio, Italy, when the tank he was aboard was struck by enemy fire while crossing the canal.\nThe tank was struck by enemy mortar, machine gun and artillery fire. His body was not recovered at the time, and the Germans never reported him a prisoner of war, the Defense POW/MIA Account Agency said in a release.\nOn May 5, 1945, the American Graves Registration Command, Army Quartermaster Corps, was the organization tasked with recovering missing American personnel in the European Theater. Investigators recovered a set of remains, designated as X-124 Castelfiorentino, from a gravesite approximately 2 miles west of Pietrasanta and 500 yards north of the Cinquale Canal, the accounting agency's release said.\nThe investigators initially associated the remains as possibly belonging to a soldier of the 92nd Infantry Division but did not have enough identifying data to make a positive identification. The remains were permanently interred at what is now Florence American Cemetery, the release said.\nDent was accounted for by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency earlier this year on Feb. 2, after X-124's remains were exhumed in June 2022 from the Florence American Cemetery in Impruneta, Italy, for laboratory analysis and identification, U. S. Army Human Resources Command Public Affairs Office said in a release.\nTo identify Dent's remains, scientists used anthropological analysis. Additionally, scientists from the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used mitochondrial DNA analysis, the accounting agency's release said.\nThe Past Conflict Repatriations Branch, under the Army Casualty and Mortuary Affairs Operations Division at the U.S. Army Human Resources Command in Fort Knox, Ky., plays a key role in the process of locating family members of missing soldiers from WWII and the Korean and Vietnam Wars.\nThe process begins with locating the family member most closely related to the missing soldier — known as the primary next of kin — followed by a request for family reference samples or DNA, which are used as a main source in identifying remains.\nOnce a soldier has been identified by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner, the Past Conflict Repatriations Branch notifies and briefs the family about the results of historical, forensic and DNA reports, benefits and the mortuary process including burial with full military honors.\nTerrence Johnson of Johnson Funeral Services said that this is the first time that he has dealt with a WWII soldier who was killed in action.\nJohnson was unsure if this was the first time a WWII soldier was reinterred in Charles County.\nHe said it was \"hard to say\" how attended the public funeral may be as Dent was survived by four sisters and five brothers, but the family members are \"spread out.\"\nDent's name is recorded on the Tablets of the Missing at Florence American Cemetery, along with others still missing from WWII. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "COVID censorship?: Could Mark Zuckerberg's admission on government pandemic pressure impact the 2024 election\n\n August 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: News \n \n 1131\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Could META / Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's mea culpa that the Biden-Harris administration \"repeatedly pressured\" the social media giant to censor dissenting voices during the COVID-19 pandemic translate into a major issue in this year's elections?In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee released Monday, Zuckerberg said the White House pressed Meta Platforms (which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) to censor and restrict accounts and posts that went against U.S. government and administration public health policies during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"In 2021, senior officials from the Biden administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\n\"I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret we were not more outspoken about it,\" said Zuckerberg, promising to push back on future government pushes in the letter dated Aug. 26 and posted on the committee's Facebook page and to its account on X.\nIn a statement, the White House defended its COVID social media actions.\n\"When confronted with a deadly pandemic, this Administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety,\" the statement to Politico and other media outlets said. \"Our position has been clear and consistent: we believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have on the American people, while making independent choices about the information they present.\"\nREKINDLING COVID FIGHTS?\nThe letter comes as Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump face off in the 2024 election just over a year from when the Biden-Harris administration officially ended its pandemic emergency declarations in May 2023.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 27 million U.S. jobs were lost, millions more saw their hours or pay cut, as many as 40% of small businesses were closed and close to 1.2 million deaths were attributed to the virus by public health agencies.\nThe coronavirus was a once-in-a-lifetime, global event. The pandemic included fights over economic and social restrictions and business and school shutdowns and pushes for government and employer vaccine mandates. Government spending and central bank infusions during both the Trump and Biden-Harris administration fueled 40-year inflation highs with high prices still hitting American households.\nOverall, U.S. prices are up 23% since the pandemic, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nBut other than persistent, post-pandemic inflation (which voters count as a top concern headed into November), COVID has not been a prime campaign issue.\nThat could change with Zuckerberg's letter, increasing conflicts between policing social media and free speech, and independent presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s endorsement of Trump.\nKennedy is a strong critic of pushes by the Biden-Harris administration and other Democrats for vaccine mandates as well as their push for social media restrictions during the pandemic.\nHe also wants more scrutiny of vaccines as well as processed foods.\nIn a social media post before his endorsement of Trump and moves to take his name off ballots in Electoral College battleground states, RFK Jr. vowed to keep COVID in the spotlight.\n\"The government also selected the lockdown winners and losers, transferring nearly $4 trillion of wealth from the middle class & small business to Silicon Valley and big box stores,\" Kennedy wrote.\nZuckerberg's letter was also not lost on Kennedy.\n\"Looks like Mark Zuckerberg has joined the ranks of the crazed conspiracy theorists who claim that the Biden administration pressured Facebook to censor dissent during COVID,\" RFK Jr. said Tuesday.\n'MEMORY HOLED'But the issue has not been overtly pressed by Trump, Biden or Harris during the 2024 campaign.\nWhy not?\nThe pandemic stretched across both the Trump and Biden-Harris administrations. Coronavirus vaccines were developed and gained fast-track approvals under Trump. They were widely deployed by the Biden-Harris administration which also pushed for a number of vaccination mandates that faced court challenges.\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' running mate after her installation at the top of the ticket after Biden quit the race in July, was an ardent advocate of COVID restrictions and shutdowns during the pandemic.\nWalz backed mask mandates, instituted a COVID hotline for residents and neighbors to report those not abiding by social distancing, stay-at-home and other pandemic rules and threatened repeat violators with $1,000 fine and 90 days in jail, according to executive orders.\nEric Raile, a political science professor at Montana State University, said in an interview before Zuckerberg's letter that voters are fairly well entrenched and the fights mirror deeper American political divisions.\n\"There's not much left to wring out of the pandemic,\" he said.\nThe two national political camps had some alignments during the pandemic.\nMassive spending measures aimed at rescuing the economy from a recession or depression were approved by both Trump and Biden. That spending, along with central bank infusions in the U.S. and across the world, help drive the post-pandemic wave.\nDr. Anthony Fauci led U.S. COVID responses for both administrations, although he fell out of favor with Trump and was fully embraced by Biden.\nWhile Biden and Harris advocated for vaccine mandates for some workers, Trump left many restrictions and policies to individual states. He has touted developments of the COVID vaccines under his watch and made off-the-cuff and confusing comments about the use of UV light and disinfectants to combat COVID.\nOther political scientists and campaign consultants see many voters wanting to move forward from all the economic, educational, social public health traumas of the pandemic.\nJeffrey Lazarus, political science professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta, contends many Americans have \"memory holed\" the pandemic and its myriad of stresses.\n\"I think people want to move on with their lives,\" he said.\n'RETURN TO NORMALCY'Ryan Waite, a veteran consultant who has worked mostly on Republican campaigns, noted the rapid news cycles and significant campaign upheavals — including the attempted assassination of Trump and Biden being pressured to quit the race — and how that makes events such as the coronavirus pandemic seem distant.\nCraig Snyder agrees that most voters want to move on from COVID and its upheavals, pointing to parallels to sentiments after the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918.\n\"I think there are very few voters who are thinking about [that]. They've probably been concentrated as RFK Jr. voters,\" said Snyder, a Pennsylvania-based consultant who is serving as director for the anti-Trump Haley Voters for Harris groups.\nSnyder said American elections are often about moving forward — especially from stressful and traumatic events. He sees contemporary similarities to the aftermath of the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic (which coincides with World War I), which killed an estimated 675,000 in the U.S and as many as 50 million worldwide, according to the University of Pennsylvania.\nSnyder pointed to Republican presidential candidate Warren G. Harding's successful campaign slogan of \"Return to Normalcy\" as reflective of the broader sentiments in 2024.\n\"For the most part, the majority of voters want to be in the rearview mirror,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium — the prime ingredient in heroin and other opiates.\nThe Taliban seized $7 billion worth of U.S. weapons and military vehicles and systems after the American retreat. More than 2,400 American troops died during the war and occupation and there more than 221,000 deaths overall, according to Uppsala University in Sweden.\nA U.S. State Department inspector general's report last month said the U.S. may have mistakingly sent as much as $293 million in foreign aid to the Taliban after the 2021 withdrawal.\nSince regaining power, the Taliban have put in place restrictive Sharia Law based on Islamic rules aimed at women and girls, including requiring full coverings of women's faces and bodies.\n\"Taliban have issued more than eighty edicts targeting the twenty million women and girls who make up just short of 50 percent of Afghanistan's population. Women and girls face draconian restrictions in public life, namely, on education, employment, access to the justice system, and activities and travel outside the home. These include prohibitions on education beyond sixth grade, veiling and dress codes enforceable by the morality police, and bans on leaving the house without a mahram, a male relative chaperone,\" the Council on Foreign Relations in a summary of the regime's actions.\n\"Afghanistan's Taliban rulers have issued a ban on women's voices and bare faces in public under new laws approved by the supreme leader in efforts to combat vice and promote virtue.\"\nThe new bans on women's voices and bare faces in were handed down last month after they were approved by supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada. The Taliban set up a ministry for the \"propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice\" after regaining power in 2021.\nThe U.S. State Department also criticized the Taliban's actions.\n\"The Taliban's relentless, discriminatory edicts and extreme policies are unparalleled and self-defeating. We have made clear to them in the last three years that they have a forked road ahead. If they respect the rights of the Afghan people and abide by Afghanistan's normative obligations, that is the road to reintegration into the international community. But the path the Taliban are pursuing is the same approach that made them a pariah in the 1990s. Their institutionalized campaign targeting women and girls constitutes gender persecution. The world is losing patience,\" said Rina Amiri, the U.S. Special Envoy for Afghan Women, Girls, and Human Rights. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Impeachment must be a deliberative judicial process\n\n August 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 842\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The dictionary defines a farce as an empty or patently ridiculous act, proceeding or situation.That is a perfect description of any effort to impeach President Joe Biden between now and the official end of his term in January.\nRecently, Republican Congressman Byron Donalds urged House Republican leaders to hold a chamber-wide vote on impeaching President Biden. In doing so Donalds cited a recently released 292-page report from Republican members of the House Oversight Committee, House Judiciary Committee and House Ways and Means Committee. The report concludes there is overwhelming evidence that while serving as vice president, Joe Biden participated in a conspiracy to enrich himself and his family.\nPredictably, White House staff immediately responded to Congressman Donald's call for an impeachment vote with a strong rebuttal statement — \"This failed stunt will only be remembered for how it became an embarrassment that their own members distanced themselves from, as they only managed to turn up evidence that refuted their false and baseless conspiracy theories.\"\nTo date House Speaker Republican Mike Johnson has not given any indication on whether or not he will schedule a vote on any motion to impeach. I doubt he will.\nSince I have yet to read that report, I will not offer an opinion on whether or not the evidence in that report is overwhelming and credible.\nI will offer an opinion on the abuse of the impeachment process.\nI am deeply concerned about the impeachment process being used to embarrass, harass, intimidate or retaliate against any president while in office, or to preclude their eligibility to serve again.\nI agree with House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, a Republican and longtime antagonist of Biden, who has said that criminal referrals could be the end of the road for this probe. He also said recently \"the best path to accountability is criminal referrals.\"\nI suggest any impeachment effort against President Biden is not only an exercise in futility it will also exacerbate the already deep divisions in American society.\nIn terms of futility, the U.S. Senate has considered U.S. House impeachment articles for a sitting president four times in our history. Each time there were not the two-thirds votes in the Senate necessary to convict. That was the case with Andrew Johnson on 11 House impeachment articles in 1868; with Bill Clinton on two House impeachment articles in 1999; and with Donald Trump on two House impeachment articles in 2020 and another single impeachment article in 2021. This second impeachment occurred when Trump had less than one week until the end of his term.\nIf President Biden is impeached in the House, the Senate trial result, if there even is a trial, will certainly be an acquittal.\nThat said, intense debate on Joe Biden's job performance during his one term as President, as well as his actions and the actions of his family during his previous two terms as vice president will likely go on long after he leaves office.\nRegardless of the final outcomes on both of these debates topics, Biden's legacy will include being on the short list of presidents since 1927 who announced they would not be a candidate for reelection to a second term. They are Republican Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge; and Democratic Presidents Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson.\nGoing forward, Americans deserve and should demand the following actions from every member of Congress, especially those in leadership positions:\nHit the pause button on all future presidential impeachments, unless there is bipartisan consensus to honor Article II, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution which says, \"The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\".End the current practice as described by former Republican President and longtime member of the House Gerald Ford — \"An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.\"Change the House impeachment rules to require a two-thirds vote to approve all impeachment articles, consistent with Senate rules requiring a two-thirds vote to convict on those articles.Let the historians and the voters decide a vice president's or president's performance or lack of performance in the execution of their official duties while in office.\nAll of the above would result in future impeachment decisions more faithfully following the constitution remedy for removal from office and barring from future offices envisioned by the authors of our constitution — impeachment should be a much more deliberative judicial process and much less a political process.\nIn a recent (August 2024) Gallup Poll, 76% of the American public expressed that they disapprove of the performance of Congress. That is nothing new. Not proceeding with a futile Biden impeachment is a small, but significant step in ending the farce that presidential impeachments have been and will be going forward without meaningful changes to help ensure no political party should ever be able to use impeachment to advance a thinly disguised and divisive political agenda.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who resides in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As I embark on this journey, I want to address a key issue that I believe is critical to our future: the need for fresh, effective leadership.A year ago, I decided to challenge a career politician who has won the last six elections and has become deeply entrenched in our district. This decision was not made lightly. It comes from a place of deep concern for the state of our politics and a desire to bring meaningful change to a system that has too often been marred by gridlock and stagnation.\nAs President John F. Kennedy once said, \"The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.\"\nI believe that now is the time for us to take a hard look at how we evaluate our leaders and the effectiveness of our current methods. While I don't claim to have all the answers, I am confident that starting fresh with new leadership could be beneficial for all of us.\nWith a population of over 700,000 in our district, it's inevitable that we won't always agree on everything. What we can agree on is the urgent need for a better and brighter future — one that cannot be achieved by repeating the same approaches that have failed to deliver results. I am committed to ensuring that every voice is heard and that our diverse needs are addressed with responsiveness and integrity.\nI am not a career politician. My campaign is built on the principles of honor, courage and commitment — values I learned during my service in the Navy. These values guide me in my roles as a son, father, businessman and veteran. More importantly, they define who I am as a patriot and an American who deeply loves this country.\nWe stand at a crossroads. As former President Ronald Reagan said, \"The government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\"\nOur district and our country need leaders who are not only committed to effective governance but also to the principles of freedom and opportunity that make America great.\nWhen you go to the polls on Nov. 5, you will face a choice: continue with a representative who has been part of the entrenched gridlock or support someone like me — youthful, self-made and ready to work tirelessly from day one. While I may be one of 435 members of Congress, I promise to dedicate myself fully to helping our country get back on track.\nBLAINE MILLER\nHavre de Grace \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Project 2025 is a project of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that only a Marxist would describe as \"fascist\" or \"bourgeois.\" Project 2025 has as its goals such things as securing the border, making federal bureaucrats accountable to Congress, cutting government spending and other policies which I have heard both Democrats and Republicans defend.\nMore of a matter of concern is the Reproductive Freedom Amendment or Ballot Question No. 1 for Maryland voters in the upcoming November general election. All you have to do is think for a minute about why we would need such an amendment. What reproductive freedoms do Marylanders lack?\nUnder current Maryland laws, adults are free to reproduce with other consenting adults, except blood relatives. They are even free not to reproduce by engaging in same sex relationships, dignified by the laws of Maryland as marriage. Those who engage in reproductive activity are free, according to the law, to terminate a pregnancy any time before the moment of birth.\nMinors once required the permission of a parent or guardian in most circumstances but under the new laws parents may lose their rights. If parents object to gender reassignment surgery, the state is already empowered to remove the child from the home. If the Question No. 1 passes, then legal action in favor of parents will be almost impossible as will be repealing the unjust laws. It already is happening in other states. So the news is: they are coming for the kids.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Typically, you are looking at people who have previously voted, who are kind in that soft middle,\" said Waite, who has mostly worked on Republican campaigns.\nWaite said while social media can help engage more voters and could help engage nonvoters, especially young ones, the medium presents challenges.\n\"You are competing with everything else. The slice of time you get in front of them is very very small,\" he said of the social media content streams.\nNegative campaigning, coarse social discourse and misinformation on key issues have also magnified on social media leaving voters and nonvoters distrustful of content and disparate and sometimes ideological information sources.\n\"It's hard for average voters to figure out what's going on,\" said Waite.\nIn an Aug. 26 letter to the House Judiciary Committee, META Platforms chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the Biden-Harris administration \"repeatedly pressured\" Facebook and Instagram to censor dissenting content (including humor and satire) related to COVID-19.\nThe White House defended those actions as helping protect public health from misinformation.\nRecent surveys show low levels of trust in politics, the media and government, as well as plenty of economic stress stemming from the post-pandemic inflation wave.\nA June survey by financial firm Credit Karma and research firm Qualtrics found 68% of Americans don't believe official economic data touting job gains and easing inflation after post-pandemic spikes in prices.\nAnother recent poll by Gallup and the Walton Foundation shows Gen Zers (ages 12 to 27) have little trust in the media, government and politics. But they showed strong turnout in 2020 and are expected to also show up in November, said Craig Snyder, campaign director for Haley Voters for Harris (a group that hopes to get GOP supporters of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to eschew Trump).\nNEW ENERGY?Snyder said Harris' campaign should energize younger voters more than the matchup between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\"They weren't excited about a race between two 80-year-old men,\" said Snyder, noting that Democratic enthusiasm for Harris will also generate GOP energy for Trump.\nHarris was installed at the top of the Democratic ticket after Biden, 81, was pressured to quit the race by donors and party power players over concerns about his age.\nSnyder said voting groups such as suburban women, Black and Hispanic men, along with voters on both sides of Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas could tip the race in battlegrounds such as Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s endorsement of Trump could also shift his voters, many of whom are disaffected by COVID policies (including vaccines), in key states.\nSnyder also sees another contingent of nonvoters beyond the disaffected and those with logistical barriers.\n\"There's a third group,\" he said. \"They just don't connect politics to their lives.\"\nGOTV EFFORTSPolitical organizations on both sides do have get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts across the country, including some aimed at first-time and nonvoters.\nConservative groups — such as Christians United for Israel — hope to turn out evangelicals for Trump and Republicans. That includes working with churches across the country on support for Israel and voter mobilization.\nDemocrats look to college campuses, as well as Native Americans, Blacks and Hispanics in key races.\nIn Montana, Nick Marroletti, coordinated campaign director for the state Democratic Party, said grassroots turn-out efforts have included knocking on 100,000 doors and making 97,000 phone calls supporting U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, who faces a tough challenge from Republican Tim Sheehy.\n'LACK OF FAITH'Mara Ostfeld, a research scientist at the University of Michigan, analyzed voting sentiments in Detroit and found Latino voters, in particular, have lower turnout propensities.\nOstfeld agrees that nonvoters, especially lower-income ones, don't see the outcome of elections impacting their daily lives.\n\"There is a disconnect,\" Ostfeld said. But she also said that doesn't mean nonvoters are not engaged or connected to their communities in other ways and don't follow politics.\n\"It's not like they are disinterested or disengaged,\" Ostfeld said. \"There is just a lack of faith in the political system in particular.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Women, younger voters and those with college or advanced degrees, as well as urbanites, are supporting Harris and Democrats.\nOLD VS. YOUNGBob Ward, a partner in the polling firm Fabrizio Ward LLC, has seen an enthusiasm gap between older voters (who tend to favor Trump and Republicans) and younger voters (who are key to Harris' and Democrats' turnout efforts).\nThe Republican polling firm has teamed with Democratic firm David Binder Research to conduct polls for AARP in presidential and U.S. Senate battlegrounds including Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Maryland and Montana.\n\"It's the economy,\" said Ward of the top issue across the board, potentially discouraging younger voters from turning out in November.\n\"Younger voters are really economically stressed. Inflation is a big deal, as are housing prices,\" Ward said. \"We've seen it in every state we've polled.\"\nU.S. prices are up 20% since Biden and Harris took office in 2021 and 23% since the COVID pandemic (which cut across both the Trump and Biden-Harris administrations and saw big government spending and central bank monetary infusions).\nWard said younger voters are also concerned about the shortage of affordable housing options. Home prices and rents soared during and since the pandemic.\nHe said younger voters are as concerned about home affordability as seniors are about Social Security. Ward said the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks has, at least in public opinion, ranked lower than economic issues.\nAppealing to voters — especially younger ones — on the economy will be key to Harris (who inherits Biden's economic standing). National and battleground polls show Harris with healthy leads among voters under the age of 45. Trump has the advantage among older voters.\nBut older voters are much more energized to vote, according to AARP's polling.\nWard said that polling shows inflation, personal finances, and the economy are also top of mind for voters age 50 and older, with 77% ranking it among the top two election-year concerns in red-state Montana, 85% in blue-state Maryland and 87% in battleground Wisconsin — with many seniors living on fixed incomes (i.e., Social Security as their primary income source).\nHISPANIC VOTERS\nConcerns about costs of living and the economy and increased GOP outreach could potentially also help Trump with Hispanic voters, even with his hardline immigration stances opposed by a majority of Latinos.\nAnaís Lopez, a pollster with BSP Research, conducted a survey of 3,000 Latino voters for UnidosUS with an oversample of Florida Hispanics and found inflation, jobs and housing are their top concerns.\n\"Those are really tied together to concerns about the economy across the country,\" she said.\nLopez also said there are many young and first-time voters in the 2024 cycle, adding that 60% of Latino voters in Florida say they have not been contacted by either party. That figure is 55% nationally, according to the polling group.\n\"We have a lot of new young voters in this electorate,\" she said.\nLopez said the UnidosUS-BSP poll released this month shows Harris with a 47% to 42% lead over Trump in Florida with Hispanic voters.\nThat spread could be tighter than in previous elections, said Clarissa Martinez de Castro, vice president of the Latino Vote Initiative for UnidosUS, stressing the need for more outreach to Latinos.\nIn the 2024 Florida survey, Trump does well with Cuban voters and leads 48% to 47% with Hispanic men in Florida.\nHarris leads with Hispanic women, 48% to 37%.\nHarris holds larger leads among Hispanics in other states including some battlegrounds. She leads Trump by 27 points among Hispanics nationally. But that is down from Biden 2:1 vote edge in 2020.\nHarris also leads with Hispanics in some key battlegrounds such as Arizona (28 points), North Carolina (29 points) and Nevada (23 points).\nBut how does that compare to 2020?\nIn 2020, Biden won Arizona's Hispanic vote by 30 points, North Carolina by 20 points and Nevada by 19 points, according to the Americas Society / Council of the Americas. Biden won Pennsylvania's Latino vote by 60 percentage points in 2020. Harris leads Trump by 35 points, according to the UnidosUS-BSP poll.\nSome of the demographic voting trends are long-standing divides in American politics. But, some of the divisions are more distinct this cycle.\nTrump was almost assassinated in July, has faced criminal and civil prosecutions and perpetually stirs controversy. If elected, Harris' would be the first woman U.S. president. But she was installed at the top of ticket after Biden was pressured to quit.\nThe 2024 campaign is also just a few years removed from all the stresses, fights and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPolls — which could potentially shift after the Sept. 10 presidential debate — have shown a close race with questions about how much Trump \"under polls\" in surveys as he did in 2016 and 2020.\nMEN VS. WOMEN\nVoting differences between men and women continue to be a prime dividing line in American politics.\n\"We are seeing a pretty pronounced gender gap,\" Ward said.\nThe most recent New York Times-Siena College national poll (taken before the Sept. 10 debate) shows men favoring Trump 54% to 38% while women back Harris 51% to 41%.\nThat mirrors an August AARP poll in Michigan showing men backing Trump by 20 points and women favoring Harris by 13 points.\nThe gender gap is also showing up in key Senate races.\nA recent AARP poll of Montana voters shows Republican Tim Sheehy leading Democratic U.S. Jon Tester by 19 points among men. The high-priced race could decide which party controls the U.S. Senate next year.\nSheehy leads Tester 49% to 41% among all voters, but by 30 points among men age 50 and older.\nPatrick Gonzales, principal with Maryland-based Gonzales Research and Media Services, said women make up 60% of the Democratic Party, so the gender divide in the presidential race and other races reflects that.\n\"Older women are very heavily Democratic,\" Gonzales said.\nA pre-debate survey in Pennsylvania, a key Electoral College battleground, by CBS and polling firm YouGov found Harris leading among women by 11 points and Trump among men by 13 points. Overall, the race is 50% to 50%, according to that Pennsylvania poll.\nIn the race to fill an open U.S. Senate seat in Maryland, Democratic Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks leads anti-Trump former Republican governor Larry Hogan 46% to 41% with a split along gender and racial lines, according to a new poll from Gonzales.\nAlsobrooks leads among Blacks (78% to 16%) and women (51% to 39%). Hogan leads with whites 55% to 29%, but only has a 44% to 42% edge among men in heavily Democratic Maryland.\nNationally, Trump does better with White voters. Harris is preferred by voters of color.\nA wild card in the race could be how well Trump does with black and Hispanic men, Gonzales said.\nTrump is courting more conservative Catholic voters, including Hispanics who might be opposed to abortion rights. He also is courting Jewish voters, a traditional Democratic voting block, touting his support for Israel. Abortion and Israel are issues that also appeal to Evangelicals, a key GOP voting block.\nHarris is hoping to gain support from neoconservatives and other Republicans who don't like Trump. She has the endorsements of former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, former Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney. She's also trying to navigate the politics of U.S. and Biden administration's military support for Israel while calling for an end to the post-Oct. 7 war in Gaza and establishment of a Palestinian state.\nA NEW CLASS DIVIDE\nWard said educational attainment is becoming one of the most distinct delineators of how someone will vote.\nEducation level is also often a signal of socio-economic class.\nHarris and Democrats are preferred by well-schooled voters. Trump and Republicans are favored by those without college or advanced degrees\nIn the AARP's Montana poll, voters who don't have college degrees support Trump by 30 points. Harris leads with college-educated voters by 6 points.\nNationally, a pre-debate New York Times-Siena poll shows Harris getting 57% of the college-educated vote in contrast to Trump getting 56% of the non-college-educated vote.\nWard said he's seen the education/class divide grow since 2016.\n\"It's definitely grown since 2016,\" he said. \"In most cases, it is bigger than the gender gap.\"\nThe 2016 election cycle saw Trump's populist ascension/takeover of the Republican Party and his bevy of controversies.\nIt also saw the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought economic and social shutdowns, close to 1.2 million U.S. deaths attributed to the virus, and unprecedented wealth transfers to the affluent, with stock markets and housing prices hitting record highs.\nOn the flip side, working-class workers lost jobs during COVID shutdowns and have been hit hard with post-pandemic 40-year highs with inflation.\nThe NYT-Siena poll shows two-thirds of voters in cities support Harris, while two-thirds of those in rural expanses and small towns back Trump.\n'ANY SCHMUCK\n'There are oceans of polls that frequent the political and media shores, with the presidential and Senate horse races making headlines and fundraising pitches.\nPollsters have had to adjust to changes in technology (namely more cell phones and younger households ditching landlines) to get an accurate mix of likely voters to respond to their questions.\nGonzales said that 30 years ago people called for polls were often excited that someone asked for their opinions and points of view.\n\"Today, any schmuck can offer their point of view 24/7 through social media, and that's the way of the world,\" he said.\nGonzales and Ward said it takes effort and a commitment to having some over-the-phone interviews with respondents to get more accurate takes on voters' pulses.\nWard said the most accurate polling needs to have a mix of landline, cell phone and online interviews to get accurate cross-sections of younger and older voters.\nExpectations are for a tight presidential race up until the election with money flowing into both partisan camps and Harris potentially raising more than $1 billion.\nGonzales said he could see some trends and victory lines developing in early October.\nHe's just not sure which competing argument will grab the 2024 wheel.\nThe veteran pollster said he could see voters gravitating toward Trump's economic message and dissatisfaction with the Democratic administration's handling of the economy, in particular, or Harris' message of \"turning the page\" from all the discord and division that centers around the former president.\nBut he also knows the challenges of polling in the divisive Trump area.\n\"The media is nonstop, and there are elements of the media who take a political bent and almost demonize those who think differently,\" Gonzales said.\nThat can discourage some from sharing their opinions.\n\"Those human beings are less likely to participate in a poll,\" Gonzales said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Advice for choosing candidates based on faith\n\n September 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JEFFREY S. TRIMBATH | Section: Columns \n \n 754\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In just over a month, Marylanders will begin casting their votes in this year's general election. Every year, citizens of our state get to exercise their \"consent,\" deciding who they want to represent them in government. In keeping with the scripture's command to love our neighbor (Mark 12:31), Marylanders of faith have a particular responsibility to participate.But how should Christians decide? What criteria should we use to choose one candidate over another?\nI suggest the following five criteria may be helpful.\nPerson. Obviously, the most immediate vote one makes is for the candidate. What is the person like? What is their experience, both in politics and in life? What is their family life like? Do they have children? Have they been successful in a variety of different vocations and callings?\nAnd what about their character? One important aspect of character emerges from the ancient meaning of the term as a \"stamping tool.\" As an image embossed on a coin, does their public persona mirror their stated commitments? For example, if a candidate publicly claims a particular religious faith, his or her position on policy issues ought to be in conformity with, or at least not contradict, the fundamental teachings of that tradition.\nPart of the character consideration is understanding that you are voting for political office, not ecclesiastical office. Of course, we want leaders in all sectors to be of good character. Favoring a presidential candidate, however, is fundamentally different than favoring your own pastor or priest.\nPrinciples and Policies. Every person has core values, rooted in what they love and believe to be true. What are those core convictions, and where do they come from?\nEvery candidate possesses core values. For Christians, our core convictions about the most important issues in life are grounded in how God created us, and what He says in the scriptures.\nWhat does the candidate believe about the human person, the nature of justice and how we're to live together? Which of these principles are more important than others?\nA candidate's principles will inform their policies. For Christians, issues of life, family, education and religious liberty are top tier. There are important lower-priority issues too — property rights, rule of law, taxes, immigration, inflation, national security — which are informed by our commitment to justice.\nParty. In our country there are two major political parties, both of which adopt platforms. Which platform most closely aligns with how God has created us and tells us to live? A candidate is one person, but that individual brings along with them the staff, resources and commitment of a political party. Which party has a history that aligns with biblical values?\nPeople. Depending on the level of office, winning candidates bring with them staff and personnel to help them serve in office. The newly elected president will place 4,000 staffers in his new administration. Who are the people who will fill those positions? Are they known for their expertise and work ethic, or known for other things that distract from the task?\nPrudence. After considering all of the above criteria, a Christian must ask: what is the most prudent choice? People of faith make political decisions in a fallen world, with a phalanx of competing dynamics and realities. Prudence is showing good and careful judgement as we make these choices. Part of making a prudent choice is understanding what is possible given this environment. Will the candidate you're choosing get elected? If that's not likely, are you supporting that candidate for another legitimate reason (to send a message, for example)?\nA key aspect of making a prudent choice is weighing which candidate is the least bad. Scripture teaches, and experience confirms, that every human is fallen. Every election, therefore, is the choice of the lesser of two evils. Both candidates may favor abortion, for example. In that case, is there one that favors other policies that better align with other biblical principles?\nThere you have it — 5 \"P's\" to help you evaluate which candidate you will choose this November. I would add a final \"p,\" and that's prayer. People of faith should fervently pray that God would give them wisdom and courage to vote for the right candidate, and pray that His will be done regardless of the outcome of the election.\nGod's people are called to \"seek the welfare\" of the city in which they find themselves, even if that land is hostile (Jeremiah 29). Taking the time to thoughtfully evaluate which candidates most effectively pursue that welfare is an important way we can love our neighbor and steward the gift of citizenship. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Debate process is broken, but it can be fixed\n\n September 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 713\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The first and perhaps the only debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is over.Now will be much longer and heated debates between their respective supporters on which candidate won and which candidate lost in the debate.\nI suggest the voters lost.\nThey lost because the current presidential debate process is broken.\nThe reasons are simple.\nThey were addressed recently by the Editorial Board at the Washington Post and by Philip Bump, a regular Washington Post columnist.\nThe Post's editorial board cited a Post and Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University survey reporting only three in 10 residents of six of the most important states in this year's presidential election trusted the media will fairly and accurately report political news.\nThe Post's Philip Bump was especially blunt when he recently wrote \"Americans don't trust the media, particularly when it comes to politics.\"\nInteresting that Bump wrote \"the media.\" He did not write the left of center media or the right of center media. The media includes, but is not limited to the following major television broadcasting networks — ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX NEWS, MSNBC, CNN, PBS and CW.\nDespite those conclusions the following were key elements of the Nov. 10 debate.\nThe debate moderators were ABC News anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live \"Prime\" anchor Linsey Davis.\nABC staff wrote the debate questions.\nEach candidate had just two minutes to answer each question with a two-minute rebuttal, and an additional minute for a follow-up, clarification or response.\nAs soon as the debate ended, the media launched into rapid response modes with their analysis of each candidate's remarks, debate performance, fact checks and opinions on the biggest takeaways from the night. The moderators even did fact checking during the debate.\nOne has to wonder how much those rapid responses reflected pre-determined thoughts rather than thoughtful analysis, reliable fact checks and opinions on the biggest takeaways from the night can occur immediately after the debate rather than after more deliberative, rigorous and objective thinking.\nLong before the Nov. 10 debate the words \"an existential threat to democracy\" have been used ad infinitum.\nI suggest one unaddressed existential threat to democracy is when the media, which is not trusted by Americans, is empowered to propose debate ground rules, develop debate questions, moderate a debate or debates, fact check during the debate, and provide rapid response post-debate analysis and rapid response post-debate fact checking.\nTo address that threat, I suggest there is a much better system based on a model on policy discourses from a time when America was deeply divided, just as we are now.\nThat time was 1858, three years before the start of the War Between the States.\nAt that time, Abraham Lincoln engaged in widely followed political dialogue with Stephen A. Douglas. All that dialogue was characterized by open, candid, civil and issue- driven conversations focused on helping voters learn more about the respective views of Lincoln and Douglas.\nThese conversations with voters often resulted in supporters applauding for their candidate.\nWhen that happened, Douglas said, \"My friends, silence will be more acceptable to me in the discussion of these questions than applause. I desire to address myself to your judgment, your understanding and your consciences, and not to your passions or your enthusiasms.\"\nTo do that going forward today, we need to reduce the currently outsized role of television broadcasters in presidential election debates. Instead of debates, they should broadcast candidate forums.\nThese forums should feature one candidate and only one candidate at a time in a 90-minute prime-time broadcast.\nSpeaking for 90-minutes straight will provide candidates opportunities to demonstrate their understanding of which issues resonate with voters, share their positions on those issues and their stamina to exercise the duties of the most demanding job in the world.\nCandidate eligibility for televised forums would be the same as those in place for the current debates — polling thresholds and appearing on enough state ballots to theoretically get a majority of electoral votes in the November election.\nThose forums could be broadcast on a rotating basis starting with the broadcast network with the highest levels of viewership, then rebroadcast, unedited, on all the other networks.\nIn addition, verbatim unedited transcripts of the forums could be widely circulated by print and other electronic media outlets.\nNow more than ever, candidate forums instead of debates are an idea whose time has come. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Who is better for Talbot County, Harris or Trump?",
    "date": "2024-09-14",
    "author": "JIM BRUCE",
    "content": "Who is better for Talbot County, Harris or Trump?\n\n September 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM BRUCE | Section: Columns \n \n 1253\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Tuesday's presidential debate provides new information about how a Trump or Harris presidency would affect Talbot County. Buried among the barbs and points well-taken in the 90-minute debate are clues about what Talbot can expect, although the debate certainly did not address every way that the next White House will affect our county.Talbot County's economic future depends on who wins the presidency. In the debate Trump doubled down on his plan to impose large tariffs, 20% and more on imported products, particularly Chinese items (about 80% of Walmart's inventory comes from China). He ignores what economists say — foreign firms will raise their prices on their exports to us to offset these import tariffs, leaving American consumers, not the exporter, paying higher prices and prompting inflation.\nFurther, these tariffs will provoke retaliatory tariffs as happened in Trump's first presidency when our national soybean exports to China plummeted 75%. Talbot County has about 40,000 acres of soybean crops, more than any other cash crop. Note that Goldman Sachs just predicted that Trump's policies on tariffs and immigration would lead to an economic downturn, while the U.S. economy would grow if Harris is elected.\nAlthough Maryland law strongly protects reproductive rights, which a state constitutional amendment on the ballot (Question 4) this fall would further strengthen, if Congress were to pass and the president sign a federal ban on abortions, it would preempt Maryland's protections. Trump said in the debate he does not support a federal law banning abortions, but when asked if he would pledge to veto such a ban, Trump dodged the question. The moderator asked Trump again, noting that J.D. Vance has said that Trump would veto a federal abortion ban. Trump dodged again explaining that Congress would never pass such a bill.\nTrump took credit for the Supreme Court reversing Roe v. Wade and shifting the issue to the states. He explained that he acted because some states were allowing abortion in the ninth month and even beyond. \"In other words, we'll execute the baby.\" This was too much even for the moderator who jumped in to say, \"There is no state in this country, where it is legal to kill a baby after it is born.\"\nIn contrast, Harris was clear, \"I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe v. Wade,\" and pledging that when Congress passes a bill codifying Roe v. Wade, \"I will proudly sign it into law.\"\nIn 2022, 2,810 people in Talbot were listed as foreign-born, but we don't know how many \"undocumented immigrants\" live here. Trump distracted much of the immigration debate repeating unproven allegations that immigrants are eating our pet cats and dogs. Talbot's real risk is that Trump pledges to deport substantially more than 11 million \"undocumented immigrants\" using the national guard, local police, federal immigration officials, and if necessary, our military, going door to door.\nThis largest mass deportation in our history would cause bedlam in our county and certainly in our workplaces with many businesses having to close. Trump continues to demonize immigrants, insulting Talbot's growing Hispanic and other foreign-born populations and creating fear in our communities. The moderator asked Trump why he killed Congress' tough, bipartisan immigration bill that would have put thousands of additional agents on the border. Trump never answered the question. Harris supports this bill, accusing Trump of preferring to run on the immigration issue, but not solve it.\nHealth care is crucial for Talbot because our population is aging, and our largest employer is health care and social services. The debate focused on what will happen to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which is popular because of its coverage for pre-existing conditions. Harris stated her absolute support for maintaining and growing the program and private health care options as well.\nWhen the moderator asked Trump why he initially opposed the program but now supports it, Trump responded that he decided to save the program and improve it. Pressed about whether he has a plan now to do that, Trump said, \"I have concepts of a plan,\" about which we would be hearing more in the future. Kamala pointed out that for nine years the Republicans tried 60 times to kill the program, which survived by one vote from a Republican, the late Sen. John McCain. Republicans never presented an alternative plan.\nNearly 21,000 Marylanders are of Ukrainian extraction and far more of us, including in Talbot, sympathize with Ukraine. In the debate, Harris described her continuing efforts to help Ukraine defend itself, beginning before the Russian invasion. When the moderator asked Trump not once, but twice, if he believes that it is in the U.S. best interests for Ukraine to win this war, Trump said instead it is in our best interests to end the war by a settlement that he claims he could negotiate between Zelensky and Putin, even before Trump's inauguration.\nFurther, Trump claimed the war should never have started, suggesting falsely that Harris caused it because she was such a weak emissary sent to negotiate with Putin that he invaded Ukraine three days later. In fact, Harris had never met with Putin. Stoking fear and providing insight into his motivations, Trump pointed to Putin's nuclear weapons, adding, \"And eventually, maybe he will use them.\" For 300 years, people of Talbot have learned we must stand up to tyrants like Putin.\nWith 600 miles of shoreline, Talbot County is especially vulnerable to the rising waters from climate change. In the debate, Harris reiterated her belief that climate change is real, we can and must address it. When Harris said that Trump had called it a hoax, Trump only responded with a disjointed reply on other subjects. (Note that the Republican platform unveiled in their convention has not a word on climate change.)\nThe difference in the two candidates' specific policy proposals presented in the debate is striking. Kamala Harris calls for a $50,000 tax deduction to help start up businesses. She wants a $6,000 tax credit for young families for the first year of a child's life. To help address affordable housing she seeks a $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, and to build 3 million new homes over four years. She pledges more negotiation with pharmaceuticals to drive down drug costs, such as the $35 cap on insulin prices.\nScouring the debate transcript, all I saw of Trump's policy proposals, other than generalizations (I will make American great again), were his pledge to reduce taxes, and to impose large tariffs on most foreign products. In her closing statement, Kamala lays out her policy vision in broad strokes. Trump spent his closing time attacking Harris' plans, labeling her the worst vice president in history, and darkly predicting we will wind up in a third world war.\nTo me the most telling clue to what our county and the rest of our country can expect from the next White House regards its character. History is replete with tragic figures whose regimes failed because they could not honestly self-appraise, accept criticism, learn from it, and alter course accordingly.\nThroughout the debate we all heard Trump proclaim every aspect of his first presidency the best in history and that of Biden/Harris the worst. In a postscript to the debate, Trump declared, \"We won the debate according to every poll — every single poll, I think.\"\nHis supporters tried to cover up this obvious falsehood by explaining that the moderators were biased, and even that Harris cheated using earbuds for outside coaching disguised as pearl earrings. Trump now refuses to debate Harris again.\nIf you care about Talbot County, vote for Kamala Harris. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) was the featured speaker Saturday afternoon.\nAs he runs for his eighth consecutive term in the House of Representatives, Maryland's only Republican in Congress asked voters to support him as well as the entire Republican ticket. He emphasized a tight race in Congressional District 6, where Republican candidate Neil Parrott is vying to potentially join Harris as conservative representation in the House.\n\"We got a job to do. Because if President Trump is going to succeed, we need to have a House majority, so I'm going to ask for your vote,\" Harris said.\n\"Those of you who know people who live out in western Maryland, call them up and tell them to vote for Neil Parrott, because I'm tired of being the only Republican in the House delegation from Maryland, and we got a shot,\" he said.\nCaroline County Republican Women member Joanne Smith helped organize Saturday's event. She said the group held a gathering back in 2020 as well. In her eyes, Trump is a fit for Caroline County voters.\n\"I think Trump represents our values,\" Smith said. \"We're a very red area. Everybody in Caroline County that's elected is Republican.\"\n\"We desperately want to see a change in our government and Trump's our man,\" she added.\nMuch of Saturday's discussion centered on ensuring Republicans secure a Senate majority. Harris encouraged attendees to vote for former Gov. Larry Hogan as he runs for Maryland's open Senate seat against Democratic opponent Angela Alsobrooks.\nHarris emphasized that without a Republican majority in the Senate and a Trump victory, conservative judges cannot be placed on the Supreme Court bench.\nAdorned in a \"Make America Great Again\" baseball cap, Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) also asked voters to toe the party line..\n\"Vote straight down the ticket, Donald Trump, Larry Hogan, Andy Harris,\" Mautz said. \"Whatever it is, whatever the qualm is, it doesn't matter. We need to get out, and we need to vote.\"\n\"This is war,\" he continued. \"We're at a national crossroads right now, and we need to put all of our cards on the table.\"\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Del. Jeff Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) attended Saturday's rally, as well as Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker.\nSpeaking to eventgoers, Hutchinson predicted that November's general election will play out similar to the 2016 vote, with Trump claiming swing states and the presidency. \"We can't wait to see it happen again,\" he said.\nThe state delegate said in an interview with the Star Democrat that the economy is the number one reason for residents on the Shore to support Trump.\n\"We see with our rising food prices, gas prices, housing prices, it's affecting everybody here on the Shore,\" Hutchinson said. \" … I see it within my district, how it's really affecting the middle-income and low-income families.\"\nSmith and Harris both noted an increase in enthusiasm among local Republicans to win back the White House. \"We want to get back to the Trump years,\" Harris said in an interview.\nDenton resident Thomas Conneely Jr. attended Saturday's gathering and echoed that sentiment.\n\"I see that there's more energy,\" Conneely Jr. said. \"But I also see an urgency that it's an emergency. That's what I see. I see people looking at it as, 'We have to.' If we don't, we're in deep trouble.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Harris to lead House Freedom Caucus\n\n September 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KATHARINE WILSON Capital News Service | Section: Local News \n \n 493\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md, 1st) is the new chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.Harris, who represents Maryland's Eastern Shore and is the state's only Republican in Congress, is a founding member of the Freedom Caucus and was already serving on the right-wing caucus's board of directors.\n\"I look forward to leading this caucus as we confront the reckless spending of the Biden-Harris Administration, work to secure our Southern Border, and defend our constitutional freedoms in the House of Representatives,\" Harris said in a statement Wednesday.\nThe late Tuesday vote came after the former caucus head, Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.) lost his June primary reelection bid, leading him to resign from his chairmanship position last week. Good was set to lead the House Freedom Caucus through December 2025.\nGood said on X that the chairmanship is in \"capable hands,\" referring to Harris' election.\nSince the House Freedom Caucus was formed in 2015, its members have contributed to legislative chaos for Republican leadership.\nNotably, the caucus played a key role in the House leadership fight that ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Ca.) and brought in current Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).\nHarris is a member of the House Appropriations Committee and serves as the committee's chair of the agriculture subcommittee.\nHis role on appropriations — the committee tasked with deciding spending for most of the government — and his new chairmanship is a win for the House Freedom Caucus, whose members say they want to limit government spending.\n\"In the annals of, 'it could never happen,' the House Freedom Caucus Chairman is also a cardinal on the House Appropriations Committee,\" Former Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pennsylvania, wrote on X. \"The @freedomcaucus continues to punch above its weight. Well done, Andy.\"\nThe House Freedom Caucus is currently pushing to add conservative policies — including a measure that would require proof of citizenship to vote — to a temporary government funding bill.\nHarris' new role may help in the Maryland congressional delegation's efforts to secure full federal funding to rebuild Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed in March.\nBefore the chairmanship vote, Harris told reporters Tuesday that he wasn't sure if the authorization for the bridge could be attached to the upcoming continuing resolution to fund the government.\nHowever, he said that because the authorization, if included, would be a part of a much larger bill, Republicans likely wouldn't base their vote on the Key Bridge.\nSen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said on Tuesday that Harris and the Maryland Democrats are helping in the House to get Key Bridge authorization through. Cardin told reporters that he is hopeful the authorization for the government to pay for the full repairs could be added to the continuing resolution.\nHarris' stance wanting the government to pay for the full Key Bridge repair project differed from the Freedom Caucus, which wanted to first look for liabilities from shipping companies before approving government funds.\nHarris has served in the House since 2011. Before Congress, Harris was a Maryland state senator for 12 years. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Ben Cardin will attend the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly.Cardin, a Democrat, will travel to New York this weekend as a representative of the United States to the U.N. to meet with world leaders, the senator said in an interview Tuesday with Capital News Service.\nCardin said his message to the General Assembly will include \"support for Ukraine, put a spotlight on the Sudan — the tragedies that are taking place there — and to try to find a way in which we can move towards the hostage release, cease-fire and peace in the Middle East.\"\n\"We know it's an incredible opportunity, in regards to Ukraine, we're gonna have this week, and I expect to use that,\" Cardin said.\nPresident Joe Biden announced his nominations for U.S. representatives to the U.N. on Sept. 9. Along with Cardin, Biden nominated Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, former Biden-Harris campaign official Tanya Leigh Flores and Michael Trager, vice chairman of the State Department's Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board.\n\"Currently serving as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Cardin has worked across party lines to further U.S. national security and to ensure that democracy, anti-corruption, transparency, good governance and respect for civil and human rights are integrated into American actions at home and abroad,\" the White House said in a statement.\nCardin served as a U.S. representative to the U.N. General Assembly in 2014 after being nominated by President Barack Obama.\nThe assembly opened on Sept. 10 and will continue until Sept. 28, with meetings among high-level government officials beginning on Tuesday. The General Assembly convenes once a year, and this year's theme is \"Leaving no one behind: acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations.\"\nMember states at the assembly will discuss a variety of issues, from rising sea levels to artificial intelligence and equitable financing for low-income countries.\n\"I'm honored to have President Biden's trust to represent our country at the United Nations General Assembly,\" Cardin said in a tweet on Sept. 10. \"Looking forward to productive, unifying conversations.\"\nThe Senate has yet to vote to confirm the U.N. nominations but Cardin said his responsibilities were not \"terribly contingent upon confirmation,\" so he can join the delegation.\n\"I have my credentials as United States senator, chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee,\" he said. \"There's not any official action I will take, because I'm a member of our delegation. It's just to work with our delegation. I don't have to give up my day job.\"\nBiden has addressed the UN each fall of his presidency, and Cardin expects him to address the body again next week. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was lauded in March 2022 in no less than the Washington Post for the selections he made and the process he used in assuring diverse and highly qualified candidates for both lower and appellate state courts. As head of the National Governor's Association during the pandemic, he was a very effective leader and spokesperson for the nation's governors, both Republican and Democratic. He worked effectively with leaders of all stripes, including two presidents.\nHe governed with the money he had, left the state with a surplus, and kept his pledges to Marylanders on taxes and abortion. He improved Maryland business climate rankings. He reacted to the disastrous defunding the police movement by refunding local police. He implemented a school choice program for lower income, underserved students. He left the state far better than he found it.\nBy contrast, it's hard to discern much about his opponent as Prince George's County executive that compares to Hogan's credentials unless you embrace identity politics. Her school system dwells near the bottom of most rankings. Hers was the last school system to reopen for in-person instruction in the pandemic. She reallocated funding for a proposed police training facility. Violent crime has increased. The current Prince George's state's attorney and Maryland attorney general both endorsed her opponent in the Democratic primary.\nWe know Mr. Hogan will be a fiercely independent and a reasoned voice in the Senate regardless of who is elected president and will bring people together to find common ground to benefit Maryland. On the other hand, Ms. Alsobrooks, given her continual fawning over the vice president as her mentor, will probably be a mere rubber stamp for Vice President Harris if elected.\nEUGENE T.

    "content": "Sept. 10 debate is history, but the hype goes on\n\n September 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 747\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The first and perhaps only debate for the 2024 presidential general election that was held on September 10th is history.Throughout their long history these debates have always experienced pre-debate and post-debate disagreements.\nAfter one of the first of three televised presidential debates in 1960, there was disagreement on the winner. A majority of voters who watched that debate on television responded in a post-debate survey that John F. Kennedy won. A majority of voters who listened to that debate on the radio responded in a post-debate survey that Nixon won.\nPrior to the most recent debate, the Harris campaign adamantly refused to consider an offer from Fox News to host a debate, an offer strongly favored by the Trump campaign.\nThis year's on-again, off-again debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris sponsored by ABC did have a happy ending for many voters. They were happy when the pre-debate hype and the actual debate ended.\nWhile the pre-debate hype and actual debate are over, there have been and will continue to be intense discussions about the Sept. 10 debate between the candidates and their most steadfast supporters.\nTopics for the post-debate debates include, but are not limited to: who won, why they won, who lost, why they lost, the fairness of the moderators, the questions posed to each candidate by the moderators, incomplete candidate answers to certain questions from the moderators, the body language of the moderators, one moderator's recent acknowledgement that he chose to aggressively pursue fact-checking a number of Trump's answers during the debate, the validity of his fact-checking observations during the debate, the need for at least one more debate, and even the earrings worn by Kamala Harris during the debate.\nNot surprisingly, in many cases, the varied answers to those post-debate debate questions are the result of the thinking on political messaging by communications guru Frank Luntz and two published works in the Washington Post on trust in the media. These observations have appeared in previous commentaries of mine, but all bear repeating here.\nLuntz has observed: \"It's not what you say or write, it is what people hear or read. You can have the best message in the world, but the person on the receiving end will always understand it through the prism of their own emotions, preconceptions, prejudices and preexisting beliefs.\"\nNo doubt the Trump campaign is fully aware of and will work hard to widely distribute the following recent and scathing observations by the Washington Post Editorial Board, and Washington Post columnist Philip Bloom that I referenced in a previous commentary.\nThe Post's editorial board cited a recent Post and Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University survey reporting only three in 10 residents of six of the most important states in this year's presidential election trust the media will fairly and accurately report political news. Bump recently wrote in the Post: \"Americans simply don't trust the media, particularly when it comes to politics.\"\nIf and how those Washington Post observations may be viewed by voters remains to be seen.\nThe same is true on the news on a second assassination attempt on Donald Trump.\nWe know every political campaign will have unexpected opportunities and unexpected challenges. The question is always when and how will they play out.\nFor Donald Trump, an unexpected opportunity (now moot) was having President Joe Biden as his opponent when it was increasingly clear Biden was past his political prime.\nFor Donald Trump, an unexpected challenge was a debate where Kamala Harris exceeded expectations.\nFor Kamala Harris, an unexpected challenge was launching a presidential campaign on short notice.\nFor Kamala Harris, an unexpected opportunity was a debate where she branded herself as a viable presidential candidate.\nBefore the debate, some polls showed Trump leading Harris in all key battleground states.\nAfter the debate, some polls polling in some of those battleground states showed Harris leading Trump in some of the key battleground states.\nNeither of the polls projected enough state wins to clinch victory in the Electoral College.\nThe bottom line is the outcome of their Sept. 10 debate alone is not predictive of the November election outcome.\nThe voters who decide who prevails in November will not be significantly impacted by who won or who lost a 90-minute debate held in mid-September.\nI expect most independent and undecided voters will vote based on their perceptions on which candidate cares most about their deepest concerns and who best articulates a positive and achievable vision for the future.\nAs always, one and only one candidate will ultimately enjoy a happy ending in the upcoming presidential election. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

My mother was born 12 years before women in this country were recognized by their male peers as being capable of making a choice about who would legislate laws, governing their lives.Amazing!\nAbstract principles that have always been touted by all branches of our government as the framework for our Constitution are truth, beauty and goodness. Kamala Harris's opponent doesn't understand the concept of truth. Beauty, it seems, is only in his eye, as the beholder.

This thoughtful, strong lady has exhibited the courage to take on this enormously, vital, global role. But she needs help from all of us.

    "content": "Meet the new boss: Artificial intelligence (AI) brings a whole new meaning to political machines\n\n September 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: News \n \n 1175\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Vic Miller is in the matrix of artificial intelligence's intersection with politics and governance.Miller ran for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, in August, finishing a distant fourth in the race.Miller's campaign centered on his plan to turn local governing decisions over to an AI-created system called VIC (Virtual Integrated Citizen).\nMiller's AI-run for local office drew international attention. He said views of AI are still frequently defined by dystopian science fiction movies with Orwellian outcomes.\n\"There is a learning curve that hasn't been achieved yet,\" he said.\nMiller said his AI goal is to prioritize public feedback and rational governance and rebuild public trust.\n\"I'm looking to get politicians out of democracy,\" Miller said.\nMiller said he is looking at a future AI run for Cheyenne City Council, and he expects to see others look at bringing machine learning to governance.\n\"The toothpaste is out of the tube,\" he said.\nBut Miller is concerned about who will be able to access and use AI going forward.\nHe created VIC via ChatGPT's Open AI, but was booted from that platform over using the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence technology for political purposes.\n\"What I didn't do is read their huge terms of service,\" Miller said.\nHe hopes the future of AI sits with open-source technology, rather than being controlled by large players. He said if the latter happens, it will be a \"horror show\" that will create a technological \"caste system.\"\nMiller has created the Rational Governance Alliance to foster open-source use of AI for data and public driven governance. Miller is looking to raise $10,000 to get the effort going.\nThat is a stark contrast to the big technology corporations and big money in the AI space.\nThe largest corporations in the AI space include six of the largest companies in the world (Apple, Microsoft, NVDIA, Amazon, Alphabet/Google and Meta/Facebook). They have a combined value of $15 trillion, according to CompaniesMarketCap.com.\n'SCARY GREAT'\nWhile Miller is focused on proving \"the viability\" of AI governance, for others, AI generates worries about misinformation and manipulation.\n\"It has become easier than ever to manipulate source material, create propaganda and influence narratives,\" said Isaac Mashman, founder of Mashman Consulting Group (a Little Rock, Arkansas-based consulting and branding firm), noting the amplified conservations around misinformation and \"fake news\" this campaign cycle.\nLou Steinberg, founder and managing partner of CTM Insights, a New York-based cyber research lab, said AI enable individuals to create convincing images and videos, and institutional and govern- mental actors to take their information and disinformation – dissemination to a mass production level.\n\"We've been using all open-source models, and they were great; Like, scary, great,\" Steinberg said.\nHe noted one of the AI voice fakes his group made of a foreign leader cost $20 to make and took a couple of man hours. \"It no longer takes Pentagon-level resources,\" Steinberg said.\nMiller said he spent limited money developing VIC via a $20 monthly ChatGPT subscription, but spent \"hundreds of hours\" feeding his creation documents and information.\nSteinberg said there are also productive uses, pointing to India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi used AI to translate his speeches and other campaign content into various languages and dialects.\n\"Better communication, better outreach, without subtitles. You can train these models to sound just like a voice. In fact, it only takes, you know, a couple hours of training time and a relatively small amount of video,\" Steinberg said, noting they don't look as awkward as past dubs.\nHe said there is a penchant to try to spot deep fakes and manipulated content.\n\"That's a fool's errand,\" said Steinberg, the former CTO at TD Ameritrade, stressing the focus should be on confirming what is real, rather thantrying to figure out what is fake.\nMashman said as AI technology improves and more creators adopt it, it will get harder and harder to discern \"what is real and what is fake.\"\nCody Buntain, an assistant professor of information and cybersecurity at the University of Maryland, recommends increased due diligence for election-year content.\n\"When it comes to the 2024 election, don't take a single piece of information at face value. Always consider the source and how it fits in the broader picture,\" Buntain said.\nWhile some AI applications will ban users who produce politically oriented content, there are scores of applications to choose from across the growing space.\n\"Generative AI is almost entirely unregulated, and there are countless platforms available for any person to use, so virtually anyone can create political misinformation with the help of AI,\" said Edward Tian, CEO of GPTZero, a New York-based AI detection company.\nThere are measures at the state level, especially in California, and proposals in Congress related to AI-generated content, especially so-called \"deep-fake\" pornography.\nSome content created via AI enjoys First Amendment free speech protections in the U.S., especially parody or opinion. There are instances where prosecutors could pursue AI creators under election interference or fraud statutes.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said in an August interview \"misinformation and hate speech\" do not enjoy First Amendment protections, sparking push back from speech advocates.\nScott Dylan, founder of NexaTech Ventures (a Silicon Valley-based, AI-focused venture capital firm), said laws and lawmakers are playing catch up to the AI wave.\n\"The political system, particularly candidates and officeholders, seems ill-equipped to fully grasp the depth of AI's influence,\" he said, noting that privacy and other laws will have to play catch up to all the changes.\nDespite AI's reach and potential impacts on jobs, it has not been at the forefront in the U.S. elections, including the presidential campaign.\n'DATA DRIVEN'\nDylan said AI is already a \"transformative and disruptive' force behind the political curtains.\n\"Campaigns are increasingly leveraging AI tools to personalize voter outreach, optimize resource allocation, and enhance messaging,\" Dylan said.\nHe is seeing campaigns using AI to analyze social media trends, predict voter behaviors and maximize fundraising.\n\"Political groups are using machine learning to identify funding patterns, which helps them allocate resources more efficiently,\" Dylan said.\nU.S. political campaigns are predicted to spend a record $10.7 billion on campaign ads this election (up 19% from 2020), according to research firm AdImpact LLC.\nNeil Sahota, CEO of ACSILabs, a San Diego-based AI firm, who is also an artificial intelligence advisor to the United Nations, said political and campaign operatives view AI as \"an indispensable tool\" to gain a \"competitive edge.\"\nHe points to both presidential camps and other political entities using AI for micro-targeting of voters and advertising buys — and machine-driven analyses of polling numbers.\nThe machines are also helping campaigns with speeches, social media and other content.\n\"Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms assist campaigns in generating speeches, social media posts, and advertisements that align with their messaging strategy,\" said Sahota, who sees even more AI in politics going forward, including more use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\nBIG BROTHER\nBut Sahota and Dylan also see voters concerned about privacy and groups surveilling their social media posts and online behaviors.\nThat gets back into the Big Brother dystopian worries referenced by Miller in Wyoming.\nDylan said voters might not like the sausage-making of AI-dominated politics.\n\"Many voters are wary of how their personal data is being harvested, analyzed and used by AI to predict their political leanings or behaviors,\" Dylan said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Experts see AI contributing to misinformation\n\n September 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SHAUN CHORNOBROFF Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1033\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — As millions of Americans prepare to cast their ballots in the election, the federal government has done little to mitigate public fears surrounding the potential influence of artificial intelligence (AI) deepfakes.Despite multiple bipartisan bills being introduced in both the Senate and the House, Congress has yet to enact any legislation and is unlikely to do so before the election.\n\"Those tools are being used to mislead voters about elections and spread falsehoods about candidates,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, said last week during an AI-focused hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee's privacy, technology, and the law subcommittee. Blumenthal chairs the panel.\nAn Elon University survey in May found that more than three-quarters of Americans believe AI abuses will affect the outcome of the presidential election.\nCapital News Service talked to multiple experts in AI and politics who explained that, while there are concerns surrounding AI, the evolving technology changing the outcome of elections is not among them.\n\"Will AI potentially convince some voters to vote for one candidate instead of another? Maybe,\" said Dr. Keegan McBride, an AI, government and policy expert at the Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford. \"Will they be able to convince a couple hundred thousand voters in Pennsylvania that they should vote for candidate A instead of Candidate B? Probably not.\"\nAI has already made its presence known in the 2024 presidential election cycle.\nIn June 2023, a video shared by the campaign team for one-time Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis showed a fake photo of former President Donald Trump hugging Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and former chief medical advisor to the president.\nTrump also posted AI images on Truth Social in August of singer Taylor Swift and her fans supposedly endorsing him. Swift endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris after the Sept. 10 debate between Harris and Trump.\nMost notably, robocalls in New Hampshire impersonated President Joe Biden and discouraged citizens from voting in the state's January primary. Steven Kramer, a political consultant, admitted to masterminding the plan and is facing 26 criminal charges, as well as a $6 million fine from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\nThe agency ruled on Feb. 8 that AI-generated voices used in robocalls are illegal.\n\"We're putting the fraudsters behind these robocalls on notice,\" FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said.\nWhile these instances drew widespread coverage, Dr. Cody Buntain, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland's College of Information, said the examples the public has seen thus far haven't had the intended effect.\n\"They're notable because they weren't convincing and no one bought them,\" Buntain said. \"Very quickly the country and the news media jumped on them, said, 'This is totally not legit,' and we've sort of all agreed with that.\"\nWhile swaying the results of the election was not a prevalent concern with any of the experts, each said AI has the potential to fuel further public distrust of government and the political system.\nPeter Loge, the founding director of the Project on Ethics in Political Communication at The George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs, has more than three decades of experience in politics.\nWhen he first started out in the industry, campaigns were cutting and pasting images. That changed when Photoshop became popular. \"It was cutting and pasting, but way better and faster,\" said Loge.\nGenerative AI is the latest evolution, he said.\n\"It's easier to generate garbage than ever before, and it's easier to circulate garbage than ever before,\" Loge said. \"Making up stuff about your opponents, making up news stories, doctoring photographs, deepfakes — lies aren't new.\"\nFor decades, trust in the federal government has been eroding. In 1964, 77% of people said they trusted the government, according to the Pew Research Center. Sixty years later, that number sits at 22%.\nThe inability to distinguish truth from generative AI has the potential to exacerbate this trend, multiple experts said.\nOn Aug. 7, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, held a rally in Detroit, Michigan, where a photo of an estimated 15,000-person crowd circulated on social media. Four days later, Trump said on Truth Social that the photos were AI-generated.\nThe photo was authentic, but Loge believes that Trump's false AI claim represents a major problem.\n\"You get to claim that the real is fake because everybody believes that everything's being faked anyway, and that increases cynicism,\" Loge said. \"It decreases confidence in campaigns and democracy, all of which is very bad.\"\nIn lieu of federal legislation regarding AI and the election, individual states have sought to address the matter. At least 19 states have passed laws since 2019 regulating the use of AI in political messaging, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nIn Maryland, six state lawmakers in February proposed legislation requiring campaigns to disclose the use of artificial intelligence for political materials.\nThe bill, which was similar to those passed in a number of other states, saw no action in this year's legislative session.\n\"We need a disclosure if there's an image. We need a disclosure if there's media. We need a disclosure if there's audio,\" Del. Anne Kaiser (D-Montgomery County) said during a Feb. 27 committee hearing. \"This bill would codify Maryland's election law.\"\nWith the Congress scheduled to go on an election break next week, it's becoming increasingly likely that there will be more consequence-free AI ads and deepfakes before Election Day.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, told Axios on Thursday that he wants Congress to adopt a laissez-faire approach to AI for the time being.\n\"We got to build consensus on what the right approach is, but I think you'll see a lot of emphasis on that in the first quarter of next year,\" Johnson said.\nWhile AI is unlikely to influence the result of the election, Buntain did offer a potential doomsday scenario come November if the vote tally is close.\n\"If people are uncertain about the outcome of the election, and there's a certain cohort of the population who already don't have a lot of trust in the electoral process,\" he said, \"then the use of AI In particular manipulated imagery has a much more risky potential to at least get people out into the streets and stir up feelings of anger and resentment and mobilize people.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Breaking barriers: Access has improved, but challenges persist for voters with disabilities\n\n September 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIke Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: National \n \n 1280\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n People with disabilities make up 13% of the U.S. population, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau.That's more than 42 million people.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control has an even broader estimate, which includes more persons with cognitive and mobility issues.\nAccording to the CDC, 28.7% of Americans have physical, cognitive or mobility disabilities.\nWhether it's 13% or more than one-in-four Americans, persons with disability also make up a sizable — and frequently ignored — voting bloc as the November elections loom.\n\"All Americans have the right to vote for candidates and issues that are important to them, and people with disabilities have a lot at stake as what is decided in November can greatly impact their day-to-day lives,\" said Claire Manning, senior director of advocacy and mobilization at The Arc (an organization which helps and represents those with developmental disabilities).\nBARRIERS TO VOTINGAccording to analyses by Rutgers University, persons with disabilities made up 17.7% of the electorate in 2020.\nThat was on par with Blacks (18.5%) and more than the Hispanics' (16.5%) share in the 2020 elections, according to Rutgers.\nBut 11 million disabled adults didn't vote in the 2020 election — making up 14.2% of nonvoters in the last presidential election.\nManning said disabled voters are a big enough block to sway the tight November elections — but they face continued barriers to voting.\n\"People with disabilities have always faced unacceptable barriers to casting their vote, and they continue to in 2024,\" Manning said. \"This means they've been less likely than people without disabilities to turn out to vote in elections.\"\nAccording to Rutgers' analyses, voter turnout among persons with disability in 2020 was 8.4% lower than among persons without disabilities. Turnout rates among persons with cognitive disabilities and mobility challenges were 25% lower than the non-disabled population.\nIn some parts of the country, voters with disabilities were more than 20% less likely to vote than voters without disabilities.\nThat includes Maryland where persons with disabilities are 20.9% less likely to vote than persons without disabilities. In Delaware, people with disabilities were 14.9% less likely to vote in 2020 and those without special needs.\nEven with the Americans with Disabilities Act, which has been in place since 1992, some polling places have accessibility issues, said Anna Anderson, voting rights coordinator with Disability Rights Wisconsin.\nAnderson points to polling places at schools, churches and other locations that might have challenges with steps, hallways, parking and voters being able to adequately use accessible voting machines.\nManning said pushback against mail-in voting and ballot drop boxes over concerns about fraud work against voters with disabilities.\nShe also said guardianship laws, lack of visual and audio voting aids and restrictions on who can help a disabled person cast ballots are also impediments.\nAnderson said mail-in curbside voting and drop boxes are a big help for disabled voters. \"There are never too many options that can exist to help people vote,\" she said.\nAnderson would like to see disabled voters to be able to cast ballots from home. \"One of the things that could be the most helpful is to allow people to vote electronically from their homes,\" she said.\nAnderson said persons with disabilities can feel stigmatized voting when they draw extra attention or if poll workers are not properly trained or aware of protocols.\nLEGAL ACTIONDRWI has also filed a complaint against Thornapple Township over the Wisconsin locality's move to remove an accessible electronic voting machine for this year's election.\nOn Sept. 20, the U.S. Department of Justice also filed a complaint against Thornapple in federal court over the action saying it violates the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), a 2002 federal law that requires polling places to be equipped with at least one voting machine that is accessible to voters with disabilities during federal elections.\nThornapple has a population of approximately 800 people and is located in the northern part of Wisconsin — 126 miles from Minneapolis.\nTownship officials have not yet responded to a request for comment.\nDOJ also said it resolved a similar dispute with the town of Lawrence, the agency said.\nThat town — which along Thornapple is located in Rusk County and is about 150 miles east of Minneapolis— has agreed to install a disability accessible voting machine for the upcoming presidential election.\n\"Our democracy works when voters with disabilities have the right to vote on the same terms as any other voter,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke. \"By failing to offer accessible voting systems, Thornapple and Lawrence shirked their responsibilities under the Help America Vote Act to provide equal access to the ballot for all voters.\"\nStacy Zimmer, who served on the Lawrence township board up until earlier this month, said the accessible voting machine was not used in a state election earlier this year and he contends Wisconsin law gives localities that option.\nHe was frustrated by outside groups' involvement in the issue in the small town of approximately 400 people\nCharidy Ludescher said there will be one accessible voting machine at the township's one polling place in November.\n'REASONABLE MODIFICATIONS'Sara Kempner, campaigns and strategic collaboration coordinator with the U.S. Vote Foundation, said the HAVA law has helped improve the voting landscape for disabled Americans.\n\"The 2002 Help America Vote Act (HAVA) has stipulated that the entire process of voting — from registering to casting ballots — must be made accessible,' she said.\n\"Voters can ask for reasonable modifications. This includes requesting curbside voting, skipping the line, or the opportunity to sit in a chair if standing is difficult. If one's assigned polling location can't meet these needs, voters can ask to be reassigned to a polling location that can,\" she said.\nKempner said the accessible voting system requirement \"means voters with print disabilities may use screen readers. Voters with motor skill disabilities may use touchscreens or sip and puff devices.\"\nHAVA also allows voters with disabilities to receive voting assistance, as long as it is not their boss or union leader.\nKempner said the law has helped shrink the turnout gap between disabled and non-disabled voters.\nIn Maryland and Delaware, voters with special needs can request mail-in or absentee ballots with online assistance tools, receive help in voting in-person and there are accessible voting machines at polling places including for persons with impaired or low vision.\nIn Montana, for example, every polling place has a specialized voting machine to help voters with disabilities vote privately. Curbside voting is also available, Voters with special needs can also get assistance filling out ballots from election judges or a designated friend or relative.\nVITAL ISSUES\nStill, Kempner sees challenges.\n\"Many polling locations are not yet fully compliant with HAVA standards. Sometimes the accessible voting systems sit unopened in boxes. Poll workers have not been adequately trained on rights and procedures,\" said Kempner, stressing the need for more awareness of disability voting rights.\nAnderson said curbside voting for those with special needs is also helpful and that her group is working with nonprofits, community and churches to help disabled and mobility challenged voters get rides to the polls on Election Day.\nShe said that is easier in bigger cities such as Madison and Milwaukee.\n\"In rural areas, it's much more difficult to provide transportation,\" Anderso said.\nManning would like to see disabled voters and the issues that impact them more present during the 2024 campaign.\n\"The disability vote is powerful. Yet all too often, people with disabilities and the issues vital to them and their loved ones are absent from candidate debates, interviews, and media coverage,\" she said.\nManning said the general public is \"overwhelmingly unaware of the experiences of people with disabilities in this country\" and how elected officials approach various programs have big impacts.\n\"They decide how government programs like Medicaid, Social Security, and Special Education, which are vital to the independence and futures of people with disabilities, function and are funded,\" Manning said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Am I right? If you haven't, you might try searching for some of your favorite topics in the .pdf file of Project 2025. (It took a while for them to release a searchable file. Now why is that?)\nThirty-one of its authors served in the Trump administration, among them Peter Navarro, just home from four months in prison for contempt of Congress. Missing from their ranks are the military leaders who served under Trump, and warn of the dangers of a second Trump administration — James Mattis, Mark Milley — along with an ever-growing number of those who served in the Trump White House — John Kelly, John Bolton. Are they alarmists?\nAre your liberal friends alarmists? I don't think so. Even Donald Trump got alarmed about Project 2025. You can find videos in which he disavows any connection with it. (That's after someone told him what's hidden away in its 922 pages of turgid prose). But watch Donald Trump's speech at the annual leadership conference of the Heritage Society in April 2022. At that time — with no knowledge of what it was — he was all in. Have you ever seen Trump deny he ever knew someone or something? Or have you seen it over and over and over again?\nI fault your liberal friends for having skipped to the bottom line and told you \"it's the end of democracy.\" I think they should have said, \"Let's define Marxism, then fascism and then the bourgeoisie.\" There are podcasts by scholars and journalists, like Timothy Snyder and Anne Applebaum, who have studied 20th century history and can tell you all about Marxism and fascism and the role of the bourgeoisie. I'd keep in mind, though, that there are the bourgeois and there are the bourgeois. Seriously.\nThere are news commentators who — bless them — have read all of Project 2025 and can tell you what's in it and give you chapter titles and page numbers so that you can check what they are saying for yourself.\nMs. Russell, I wrote this because you said you were curious.\nMARGARET BARTON DRIGGS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That long and terrible war would involve many members of my family.My father served in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific on an antiaircraft gunboat protecting larger ships from air attack. My father-in-law served in the U.S. Army infantry in Germany fighting in the Hürtgen forest and eventually being seriously wounded. My Uncle Ben was part of the 82nd Airborne Division jumping into France on D-Day. (He was also a great football coach, see Syracuse University 1960). I am very proud of all these people; they were all heroes.\nDonald Trump, a former president of the United States, does not agree with me. In his own words he sees these people as \"losers and suckers\" not worthy of his respect or recognition.\nRecently this same attitude was on full display when Donald Trump, invited by grieving families, organized a trip with cameras to Arlington Cemetery to visit Section 60 of that cemetery. Section 60 is reserved for fallen heroes from Iraq and Afghanistan. Arlington Cemetery specifically prohibits using the cemetery for political purposes.\nAn employee of the cemetery tried to prevent Trump and his staff from filming his political campaign video but was pushed aside. The U.S. Army has subsequently condemned Trump's actions and firmly defended the employee's actions. The employee has declined to press charges citing fear of harassment from Trump's supporters.\nMr. Trump recently denigrated those in our military who were awarded the Medal of Honor, our nation's highest military decoration. He described the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which he recently conferred on a wealthy campaign donor, as better because Medal of Honor winners are \"in very bad shape because they've been hit so many times by bullets or they're dead.\" Our military says that a Medal of Honor winner may be saluted by any member of the military, regardless of rank. That is the respect due to those who wear this medal.\nThen there is the issue of bone spurs. Mr Trump, at age 24, sought to avoid the Vietnam War. He was granted a draft classification that allowed him to avoid service because a doctor friend of his family certified that he suffered from disqualifying bone spurs. His family members have stated that no bone spurs were ever previously mentioned. Yet, he feels free to denigrate those who have served.\nAny one of these actions makes you ask the question? Why does anyone want to support this man to be commander in chief of our armed forces? If you served our country in uniform, or you honor those who do, you should not vote for Donald Trump. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But maybe Alsobrooks needs to put the brakes on an image that she mirrors St. Mother Teresa, and maybe take a look as to whether she mirrors former Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, a politician who was recently convicted and sentenced for perjury and mortgage fraud.In that connection, Angela Alsobrooks presents an image in her ads that she is a lawyer and former state's attorney; in other words Angela knows the law.\nHowever, recent investigations into Alsbrooks' background produced reports from WTOP news and CNN news media that she improperly took advantage of tax breaks she did not qualify for, including one meant only for low-income senior citizens. As a result, Alsobrooks wound up not paying thousands of dollars on two properties in Washington, D.C., and Maryland.\nCNN also reported that, for more than 10 years, Angela Alsobrooks claimed a homestead tax credit exemption that is meant to apply only to a primary residence. which resulted in a violation of state and local tax relief requirements. And, according to the WTOP and CNN reports, that provided illegal tax savings for Alsobrooks in the amount sixteen thousand dollars. So, based upon that investigation, voters may need pause and take a hard look to determine that if Angela Alsobrooks were to be elected, would she be a senator in the image of St. Mother Teresa, or tax crook in the image of Marilyn Mosby.\nPolitics … hmmm.\nRON FRAMPTON\nTilghman Island \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "How “blue” is Maryland? A closer look at the state’s voting history\n\n October 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DYLAN SHULMAN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 663\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The 2024 election is Donald Trump's third bid for the U.S. presidency, having won in 2016 and lost in 2020. Maryland voted for the Democratic candidate in both cases, and its 10 electoral votes have been considered a given for the Democratic candidate in past general elections.As the 2024 general election nears, Capital News Service examined how Maryland has voted in presidential elections over the past 50 years.\n\"Maryland as a whole has high levels of education, which is one of the things—but only one of the things—that helps to account for its commitment to the Democrats,\" said Matthew Crenson, professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins University's political science department.\nOther factors Crenson mentioned were that Black voters make up around 30% of Maryland's electorate, as well as large numbers of the Latino community, although the political leanings of the latter demographic are currently in flux.\nCurrent Maryland opinion polls for the 2024 election have Harris ahead of Trump by a significant margin, par for the course in a state that has voted consistently blue for eight presidential elections. According to data from the Maryland State Board of Elections, Maryland voters have chosen only three Republican candidates since the 1960s: Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.\nIn 1972, Nixon was an incumbent president who won re-election in a landslide victory, the largest popular vote margin in United States history. Reagan's 1984 victory was another case where the incumbent was an extremely popular candidate. In the following election, Bush narrowly won 51% of the Maryland popular vote.\nIt's generally agreed that the 2024 election's swing states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin; some include North Carolina in the list as well.\nAre there \"swing\" counties in Maryland?Three counties switched sides between the last two elections: Frederick, Kent and Talbot voted for Trump in 2016, but Biden won in those three counties in 2020.\nKent could qualify as a swing county. Voters there chose the Democratic candidate three times out of the last nine elections, and the voting margins were typically small: in four elections, merely a fraction of a percentage point decided the county's popular vote. Kent is also the state's least populous county, with about 19,000 residents, according to 2020 U.S. census data.\n\"The balance of politics within a small population can change radically with relatively small changes in the population itself,\" Crenson explained.\nBiden won Frederick County by about 10 percentage points in 2020. The three previous general elections in the county were close, with the Republican candidate winning in each case by less than four percentage points. Crenson said that Frederick County is becoming more politically divided as it becomes \"a suburb of Washington.\"\n\"The result is that federal employees, most of whom vote Democratic, are beginning to populate Frederick County and taking over its electorate,\" Crenson said.\nIn fact, the voting habits along the entire I-95 corridor are subject to influence from the nation's capital, Crenson said.\n\"Government employees tend to have rather high levels of education and recently—that is, within the last 10 or 15 years—people with college degrees have been gravitating toward the Democratic Party,\" he said.\nMaryland voter turnout—the percentage of registered voters who cast a ballot—also took a dip from 74% in 2012 to about 72% in 2016. A change in voter turnout under five percentage points is typical, but 2016 was the lowest voter turnout since 1996, the general election between Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican Bob Dole.\n\"Neither of the two candidates electrified Maryland,\" Crenson said.\nThe 2024 election will be the first general election after the COVID-19 pandemic. For the last election, which took place at the onset of the pandemic, the Maryland State Board of Elections restricted poll voting and encouraged voters to request and complete mail-in ballots, which accounted for a majority of all Maryland ballots.\nThe results of the 2024 election will establish whether many Marylanders continue to vote by mail or return to the polls. Crenson predicts that mail-in ballots will likely continue to be the avenue for many voters. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Putin's obsession with Ukraine has deep roots\n\n October 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 979\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Vladimir Putin has held continuous positions as president or prime minister of the Russian Federation (Russia) since 1999. Russia's landmass is the largest in the world and has a population of 141.7 million. Putin has amassed a great fortune in these 25 years by robbing the Russian people of their wealth. Now he robs them of their sons, and potentially ours, in a mad military quest to emulate the glory of a Russian ruler who lived 300 years ago.Putin was born in St. Petersburg in 1952. He was a communist who spent 16 years as a KBG agent in former East Germany. When the Soviet Union collapsed, each member country became autonomous. Putin returned to St. Petersburg and was soon appointed the mayor's adviser on international affairs. The mayor lost his reelection in 1996, and Putin moved to Moscow and among other jobs organized the transfer of the former assets of the Soviet Union and Communist party to the Russian Federation.\nIn 1997 President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin deputy chief of the presidential staff. In 1998 Yeltsin appointed Putin head of the FSB (the successor organization to the KGB). In 1999 he was appointed acting prime minister of the Russian Federation.\nToday, Putin is obsessed with Ukraine, Russia's neighbor and the biggest country in Europe. Putin wants to be considered the new tsar of a greater Russia and become as famous as Peter the Great, as tsar Peter was called after defeating the Swedes and declaring himself the emperor of Russia.\nTsar Peter was ruler of Russia between 1696 and 1725. He wanted access to the Baltic Sea because Russia was landlocked. All the land around the Baltic belonged to the Swedish Empire. He won the battle of Narva in 1704 against the Swedes and occupied the Baltic province of Ingria (today part of Estonia) and Finnish provinces up the Neva River from the Gulf of Finland.\nOn these wetlands he decided to build a new city, which became St. Petersburg. The warrior/king Charles the XII of Sweden then attacked Russia from Poland where he had led a successful battle against the Polish king. As the Swedish army of 40,000 men pushed toward Moscow, it lost half the army in a year of battles between the two rulers. Tsar Peter won the final battle at Poltava in 1709. Notably Ukrainian Cossacks fought against him on the Swedish side. This was the end of the Great Northern War between the two empires. (Poltava is a small town located in the center of today's Ukraine).\nAn additional reason why Putin wants to take possession of today's Ukraine is the capital city of Kyiv. It was the first capital of the Rus, precursors to Russia in the ninth century. The city was later called \"the Mother of Russia\" and is where the Russians first converted to Orthodox Christianity. In comparison, Moscow became the capital of Muscovy in the 13th century, a Russian province. Peter the Great moved the capital from Moscow to St. Petersburg in the 1720s, but in 1918 Lenin moved the capital back to Moscow.\nPutin has commented that the Great Northern War ending in Poltava was a struggle over Ukraine between Russia and the West. He sees himself as the tsar of today's expanding Russian empire. Putin first attacked Ukraine in 2014 and slowly took the Donbas region, an industrial region with a large coal field backing onto the Dnieper River.\nIn addition, Putin sent in his black-shirted soldiers without insignia to take Crimea under false pretenses. Crimea is a tropical peninsula connected to Ukraine by a land bridge and the home of the important naval port, Sevastopol, on the Black Sea. In 2018 Russia built a long bridge across the Azov (inland) Sea in the other direction connecting this peninsula to the Russian mainland.\nIn 2022 he again attacked Ukraine, now from the north, thinking it would be an easy war, and that he would take Kyiv in weeks. The Ukrainians were able to withstand this attack and retake any land he had acquired in the north. South of the Donbas, Putin took the provinces along the Dnieper leading down to Crimea to allow Russia better access to this important peninsula.\nMany believe that if Putin takes Ukraine, he will not stop there. The three Baltic states and Poland are the next prime targets, and they are all members of NATO. If he attacks one of these states, all members of NATO including the U.S. will have to send young soldiers to fight him, and we may end up with another World War.\nDonald Trump and members of Congress seem to admire Vladimir Putin, this communist dictator whose power has gone to his head. According to what he says, Donald Trump does not seem to understand that it is better to send money and munitions made in the U.S. than our soldiers to protect our democracy. As George Will writes in his column in the Washington Post: \"U.S. credibility, the coin that purchases deterrence, depends on the success of Ukraine, which does the dying\".\nWe must also not forget that when Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, it held the third largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world. The U.S., Russia and European nations encouraged Ukraine to move these weapons to Russia for safekeeping and destruction, stripping Ukraine of the ultimate guarantee of their sovereignty. Ukraine agreed reluctantly and in 1994 joined the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear weapon state. In exchange the U.S. and Russia promised economic support and security assurances.\nRussia reneged, and the outcome of our presidential election will determine if the U.S. reneges on its promise.\nIf Donald Trump wins the November election, the result for Ukraine would be catastrophic. Trump has said that he can end the war in 24 hours, meaning that he will give Putin a free hand and no more help for Ukraine from the U.S. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Encounter with Jimmy Carter provides memories\n\n October 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LINDA EVANS | Section: Columns \n \n 724\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Editor's note: This column originally appeared in the Star Democrat on Oct. 17, 2021. It is repeated here after Jimmy Carter celebrated his 100th birthday this week.It was the mid-seventies and I was a young Washington, D.C., Republican staffer with the rare opportunity to work as a personal assistant for the Honorable and Mrs. George Romney (Mitt Romney's parents).\nPretty exciting for a farm girl from the Eastern Shore of Maryland. When the Romneys invited me out to formal occasions, as a member of their staff, I was occasionally mistaken for Mitt's sister, Lynn.\nIt was cherry blossom time, and a longtime friend who drove me to the Tidal Basin that day happened to be an employee of the Secret Service. As we walked around the Tidal Basin, a long, black limousine pulled up and my friend yelled, \"It's the president.\"\nI nonchalantly responded, \"The President of what? What company?\"\nHe repeated, \"It's President Carter! It's Carter!\nAs a government employee, he knew to position us near where the president's car door would open, with the idea of taking a photograph of the president, if possible. When President Carter emerged from the limousine, I was indeed one of the first in line, and even though I was a staunch Romney Republican, I did what any American would do, outstretched my hand and shook the hand of the president of the United States. Many would be lost for words at that point, but I somehow found the presence of mind to say sincerely, \"Thank you for being our president.\"\nPresident Carter, apparently touched by my sincerity, thanked me. My friend had his old Polaroid camera with him and asked the president if he would mind posing for a photo. The president quickly agreed, and then said to no one in particular: \"Isn't she beautiful?\"\nWhat a compliment for me. I smiled for my friend's camera and that was the end of the exchange; my friend and I were off to tour the cherry blossoms with hundreds, possibly thousands of others that evening.\nThe Polaroids turned out so-so, but my friend, being politically minded, said he had seen White House photographers there. In fact, since I had my new black velour jacket over my arm, he said he felt the Secret Servicemen were carefully watching me for the president's safety.\n\"Why don't you call the White House and see if any of them got you on film?\" he suggested. What an outlandish thought, but tempting. The next day, I looked up the White House switchboard number and hesitantly dialed 212-456-1414, and asked for the White House press secretary, as I had been instructed by my friend.\n\"Hello, this is Karl Schumaker,\" the voice on the phone answered with a German accent. Since I am also of German descent, we had something in common. I said, \"Sir, you won't believe it, but the president of the United States told me I was beautiful yesterday at the Tidal Basin. \"\nPause.\n\"What were you wearing?\" he asked.\n\"I was wearing a pink jumpsuit and pink scarf.\"\n\"You are beautiful,\" Karl said. \"I have three photographs of you. Would you like me to mail them to you or would you like to come to the White House and pick them up this week?\"\nI chose the date of Thursday that week because my sister would be in town, and we not only got autographed photos that day, but a tour of the Oval Office and presidential memorabilia. I showed the photos to our parents and then I filed them in my big, old file cabinet, with only one of the photos on my office wall, seen by almost no one. I'm still a Romney Republican and always will be, but also a Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter fan.\nAnd a fan of someone else in the White House, the Press Secretary Karl Schumaker, who would teach the importance of customer service and taking extra time out to make memories that have lasted over 40 years. It was President Carter's birthday on Oct. 1 (he turned 100), and he received the Nobel Peace Prize also on Oct. 11 (in 2002), which reminded me of this occasion.\n\"To this day, Jimmy Carter looks back on a life of faith and service, and ahead to a more peaceful world,\" Mark K. Updegrove wrote in an article titled \"Building a Better World,\" found in in Parade Magazine, Feb. 18, 2018. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In that regard, it was impressive.She opens the letter asking if anyone other than her thinks the White House is devoid of leadership. Clearly this a joke. She should have put \"LOL\" after the question. Tens of millions of Trump supporters agree with her. Fortunately for America, more tens of millions don't agree. Trump has never won the popular vote and won't in the election.\nMs. Wieland then goes on to cite a series of alternative facts that are mostly not true. Kamala never said defund the police, never said she wants to give \"illegals\" all they want, never said she does not like Israel, never said she's going to take away Ms. Wieland's sacred guns. Here's a joke. How do you label someone who writes untruths? A Republican. (LOL)\nHer closing wish is most ironic. She says she hopes Putin does not read her letter, so he does not learn what a mess America is in. Duh? This is like me saying, \"I hope no one reads this, but Trump has romantic feelings for Putin.\" LOL. That's a joke because he only wrote love letters to the dictator of North Korea.\nFinally, she calls for \"strong leadership.\" Trump only thinks dictators are strong. Recently he said Putin is \"at the top of his game.\" China is strong under a dictator Trump said he envies. The weak, according to Trump, are the United States military that are \"suckers and losers\" for defending America. All women are weak and liars, and they need him as a \"protector\" to make them happy. Jews are weak and may cost him the election. Immigrants are weak. People of color are weak and only work in \"Black jobs.\" Christians who promote the love of Christ are weak. (In contrast to Christian Nationalists who promote hate and power.)\n\"Hey, Putin, listen up,\" Trump also says America is weak.\nTrump is a coward. He is a bully, and bullies are cowards. His daddy got him out of service during Vietnam. All the sane military flag officers that served under him have written books about how stupid, reckless and cowardly he is.\nDon't vote for Trump for strong leadership. Vote for Trump if you want a stupid coward as our dictator.\nMICHAEL DAVIS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hogan and Alsobrooks face off in debate\n\n October 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JACK BOWMAN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1034\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OWINGS MILLS — The issue of Republican Senate hopeful Larry Hogan's party allegiance took center stage in his first, and perhaps only, debate with Democratic opponent Angela Alsobrooks on Thursday.As he has throughout his campaign, Hogan, who moderator Chuck Todd mentioned was recruited to run by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) spent much of the debate distancing himself from the GOP on several issues and attempting to establish himself as an independent.\n\"You're going to hear nothing but red versus blue,\" Hogan, the former Maryland governor, said early in the debate, which was televised on Maryland Public Television, WBAL in Baltimore and WRC in Washington Thursday at 7 p.m. \"I care a lot more about the red, white and blue.\"\nHogan also pointedly rejected the premise of being a party-line Republican, saying he has a \"proven track record\" of standing up to former President Donald Trump, McConnell and the Republican Party. He also said the country needs more \"mavericks\" in the Senate.\nAlsobrooks, for her part, took aim at those claims. Specifically, she asserted that Hogan's personal stance on abortion, and his promises to support the codification of Roe v. Wade, wouldn't matter if the Republicans gain control of the Senate.\n\"I believe the governor when he said that he would like to vote with Roe,\" said Alsobrooks, currently Prince George's County executive. \"But, you know what? The fact is, if the Republicans have a majority in the Senate, there will be no vote on Roe.\"\nForeign policyThe through line of partisanship continued as the debate shifted to foreign policy, and specifically the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nWhen questioned about her stance on the conflict, Alsbrooks echoed the position held by many national-level Democrats, emphasizing both her support for Israel and her concerns surrounding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the need for a two-state solution.\n\"I believe in this moment, we have an obligation to make sure that we're getting those hostages home to their families,\" Alsobrooks said, referring to hostages taken by Hamas during an attack on Israel on Oct. 7 last year, \"and that we get to a ceasefire, making sure that…we get aid into Gaza for the Palestinians who are suffering.\"\nHogan used his time expressing unequivocal support for Israel, a view he has repeated throughout the campaign. He noted he did not differ with the retiring Democrat whose seat he and Alsobrooks are campaigning for.\n\"I'm going to be a strong supporter of Israel, as I always have been,\" Hogan said, \"and I'm going to be more like a champion for Israel, like Ben Cardin.\"\nThe Supreme CourtAs the debate shifted to the topic of the Supreme Court, Alsobrooks pushed for reform of the nation's highest court, referencing term limits or expansion of the number of justices.\n\"I think we're going to have to do something to reform the Supreme Court,\" Alsobrooks said. \"Again, looking at the decisions they've made, everything from overturning Roe, I think there are ethical problems with the Supreme Court.\"\nAlsobrooks went on to say, \"this is another place where me and Mr. Hogan disagree.\"\nHogan did draw a contrast between his position and that of his opponent, saying that the pushes for reform are politically motivated.\n\"I think if there's one thing that we should not be politicizing, it's the Supreme Court,\" Hogan said, \"and yet it has been politicized by both sides. And I think trying to change the rules to jam things through on a party-line vote is not the right way to go about it.\"\nAbortionAs it has been throughout the campaign, abortion was a major issue in the debate.\nOne difference between the two candidates was their strategies for passing legislation to codify Roe v. Wade, the right to an abortion.\nAlsobrooks advocated abolishing the filibuster, a Senate procedure that allows debate on a measure to continue until 60 senators vote to stop it. Many critics of the Senate, including some senators, consider the filibuster an impediment to passing bills that have the support of a majority of lawmakers.\n\"We've seen the filibuster has been used in ways that have been very destructive, and it really has not been in the interest of the people,\" Alsobrooks said.\nHogan, in response, cited bipartisanship in his opposition to removing the filibuster.\n\"I like the idea of continuing to have to find people across the aisle, find that bipartisan compromise,\" Hogan said.\nHe also compared Alsobrooks' stance to that of Trump, saying that both of them want to change \"long standing rules that require bipartisan cooperation.\"\nGun control and crimeBoth candidates, in their general comments on gun control, said they supported \"common sense gun legislation.\"\nHogan, for his part, said he would support a \"bipartisan, commonsense assault weapons ban.\"\nHe also accused Alsobrooks of pulling safety officers out of schools, a point that Alsobrooks disputed.\nAlsobrooks said she would be in favor of \"eliminating assault weapons\" and \"removing ghost guns from our streets.\"\nShe said the former governor \"in fact, vetoed legislation that would have created a waiting period for long guns and outright refused to sign the ban on those guns.\"\nOn the issue of crime, Hogan trumpeted his \"refund the police initiative,\" while saying that Prince George's County has cut its police force under Alsobrooks' leadership. Hogan charged that \"crime is out of control\" in the county.\nAlsobrooks insisted otherwise, saying that she \"oversaw a 50% lowering in crime.\"\n\"I not only support law enforcement, I was law enforcement,\" Alsobrooks said.\nPersonal votingIn perhaps her most direct attack on Hogan's embrace of bipartisanship, Alsobrooks took aim at Hogan's write-in vote for Ronald Reagan in the 2020 election and his refusal to vote for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in the 2024 election despite the former governor's opposition to Trump.\n\"For a person who says he could see a bipartisan way forward,\" Alsobrooks said, \"but was unable to do the most bipartisan thing ever in an election where he says he despises (Trump), but cannot bring himself to even vote for Vice President Harris … will have forfeited the chance to vote in three different elections rather than stand up, do the right thing, choose a tough vote and vote for a Democrat.\"\nHogan explained his reasoning: \"I've never voted for someone I didn't believe in.\"\nHe went on to say, \"that's why we have the ability to write-in and take whatever decision you make.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "As governor, Hogan used veto dozens of times\n\n October 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LARRY PIFER | Section: Columns \n \n 506\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Larry Hogan ran for governor of Maryland in 2014, presenting himself as politically moderate and vowing fiscal responsibility.He defeated an opponent who ran a lackluster and halfhearted campaign. After becoming governor, Hogan used his veto power dozens of times to block legislation needed by Maryland. Fortunately, most, if not all, of those vetoes were overridden by the Maryland legislature.\nHogan vetoed legislation to gradually increase the minimum wage to $15 over several years. He also vetoed an earned sick leave bill that would require employers to give employees five paid sick leave days per year and establish a paid family and medical leave insurance program. The Maryland General Assembly overrode the veto with the hard work of a broad coalition of civic, labor, small business and faith groups, state legislative leaders and the public.\nOn the issue of reproductive rights and access to abortion, Hogan vetoed a bill that would increase the number of trained health providers and the availability of services including in the two-thirds of Maryland counties that have no abortion care providers. Hogan issued his veto just as the Supreme Court was preparing to overturn Roe vs. Wade, and Maryland was facing the imminent need for reproductive care for women arriving from neighboring states like West Virginia.\nAfter the Maryland legislature overrode his veto, Hogan denied a request from the state comptroller to release $3.5 million in appropriated funds for training new providers in quality and safe care\nOn education, Hogan vetoed the landmark legislation called \"Blueprint for Maryland's Future,\" which was developed by the Kirwan Commission after extensive input and careful study. The legislature overrode Hogan's veto and enacted a 10-year plan to expand pre-kindergarten programs, increase funding for schools with high concentrations of poverty, increase pay for teachers and create new pathways for high schoolers who don't plan to attend college.\nOn preventing gun violence, Hogan vetoed background checks on the sale and transfer of shotguns and rifles. Legislation was eventually enacted over his veto in response to the Capital Gazette mass shooting in Annapolis.\nOn voting rights, Hogan vetoed a bill that would have given voters an opportunity to sign their mail-in ballots if they forgot to do so.\nLarry Hogan, when he was governor, consistently championed Republican views and beliefs. Many of the above-mentioned vetoes by governor Hogan were overridden by the legislature because it was the will of voters in Maryland. Now Mr. Hogan wants to be our senator and is taking credit for the work done by the legislature by painting himself as a moderate Republican who will champion woman's reproductive rights, support family leave policy, voting rights and increase school funding.\nThis is just not true, and Hogan's record reflects that. If Larry Hogan is the senator from Maryland, he will support those ideas and directions that he has supported before.\nMost important, even if Larry Hogan were not misrepresenting his position on the issues and would vote as a moderate, his very presence in the Senate as a Republican may well determine which political party controls the Senate and its entire legislative agenda. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No chance of seeing through the blackened window. That's how I found the entrance to the Circulation Department of the Star Democrat one day last February.My heart sank, and not because I would have to get on the phone with them about my subscription. My heart sank at this symbol of an unfree press.\nWhat's wrong? I asked someone who would know. I got information on the hours when one could go to the front entrance and get to visit the newsroom, and mention of the attack on the Annapolis Gazette five years ago.\nSo, a question of security. But the memory of the locked door and the blackened window remained in my mind as a portent of things that could come.\nOne of the first items in a dictator's bag of tricks is to shut down the free press and retain one news outlet as the voice of the regime. Did you hear Donald Trump say, after his debate with Kamala Harris, that ABC should lose its license? Trump talks often about shutting down news outlets; he has sued 20 of them. Advisers such as Steve Bannon and Kash Patel have openly talked about plans to seek revenge against journalists.\nAnd here we are in Talbot County, Maryland, proudly celebrating 225 years of continuous news coverage of this community. Over those years the local press has risen from ashes a few times, had its equipment wrecked, and, during the Civil War, lost a Southern-sympathizing editor to exile.\nOur local newspaper keeps the community informed about itself, and we're damned lucky to have it. But what if — in a second Trump administration — somebody came over from Washington with the authority to shut down the Star Democrat? There is every reason to consider that possibility.\nMARGARET BARTON DRIGGS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "3 weeks before election, Alsobrooks visits Easton, brings U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz with\n\n October 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 571\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In a crowd of people in front of a parked green tour bus with her face on it, Angela Alsobrooks, the Democratic candidate for Maryland's open U.S. Senate seat, danced to \"Can You Feel It\" by The Jackson 5 in slacks and sneakers.The current Prince George's County executive stopped by the parking lot behind the Goodwill in Easton Wednesday morning to speak to a group of supporters. The event drew residents from Talbot and neighboring counties.\nBetween dancing and taking photos, Alsobrooks and a few others spoke at a podium in front of the green tour bus. Speakers included U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hi.), Talbot County Council members Pete Lesher and Keasha Haythe and Talbot County Democratic Central Committee Chair Patrick Firth.\nAlsobrooks talked about the importance of caring for others. She called the election an opportunity to ensure the \"right kind of future\" is being built, bringing up the importance of reproductive rights, economic opportunity and passing \"sensible laws\" to prevent gun violence.\n\"This race has become so critically important to what happens all across the country,\" she said.\nThroughout her campaign, Alsobrooks has talked about the importance of the Democratic party maintaining its Senate majority and how voting for her can help ensure that.\nAlsobrooks is running in the Nov. 5 general election to fill retiring Sen. Ben Cardin's (D-Md.) seat. She is running against former Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a rare two-term Republican governor in the state, which is widely considered to be a Democratic stronghold.\nHogan has positioned himself throughout his campaign as someone willing to work across the aisle.\nDuring an April visit to Easton, Hogan said, \"A lot of people are frustrated that nothing ever seems to get done in Washington, and so I think they think I got a lot done while I was governor.\"\nAccording to a poll from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County Institute of Politics released Oct. 9, Alsobrooks was found to be leading the senate race with 48% of the vote compared to Hogan's 39%. The poll found that 6% of Maryland's likely voters would vote for some other candidate and 5% are undecided.\nIn the poll — which surveyed 1,003 Maryland adults from Sept. 23 to Sept. 28 — 863 Marylanders were identified as likely voters. The poll had a 3.3% margin of error.\nSchatz said Alsobrooks would be an \"incredible\" addition to the U.S. Senate because \"she understands what the people of Maryland are going through.\"\n\"She's done economic development,\" he said. \"She's done public safety. She's fought for women. She's fought for human rights. She's fought for civil rights. And now the stage will be set for her to do that on a national level.\"\nHaythe said Alsobrooks will fight for economic development opportunities in Talbot County and across the Eastern Shore.\n\"We need her partnership,\" Haythe said.\nLesher talked about the importance of federal funding in local government. He said Alsobrooks understands the importance of getting federal assistance to local governments.\nEaston resident Tara Leeson said she is voting for Alsobrooks to keep a Democratic majority in the Senate. Leeson, who used to be a teacher, said she felt Hogan didn't properly support educators during his time as governor.\nCaroline County resident Susan Andrew — who said women's rights and sensible gun legislation are important issues to her — said she enjoyed the event Wednesday morning.\n\"Just the community and everybody being supportive of each other and wanting to see Democrats win,\" she said about what she liked. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Slush suddenly snaps to attention and solidifies. Sometimes verifiable facts coalesce in the same way.Gen. Barry McCaffrey, retired U.S. Army, with a visage like a human thunderhead, explained why it was obvious to him in 2020 that Donald Trump was setting the stage for a coup attempt.\n\"He had an acting secretary of Homeland Security, he had an acting attorney general, he had an acting secretary of defense,\" he said. \"He tried to fire the CIA director and put an acting director in there.\"\nFor those who didn't know — I didn't — he tells us what all those firings and tentative appointments meant. Gen. Mark Milley, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at that time, \"had no command authority over the armed forces at all ... and so when Secretary [of Defense] Mark Esper was fired, and a retired lieutenant colonel functionary of Trump appeared as the acting Sec Def — not confirmed by the Senate — the legal chain of command was Trump and this retired lieutenant colonel. So we've got to understand that there was a potential for censoring armed insurrection suppression of an election.\"\nFor a civilian, that last sentence is hard to parse. He meant that Trump had set up a power structure that would allow an armed insurrection to succeed. It didn't succeed. The credit for saving the country, Gen. McCaffrey said, goes to \"Gen. Mark Milley, the media and many Republican politicians.\" (Can't we mention some Democrats, too? Never mind.)\nWhat a clever thing Donald Trump did. He set up a takeover of the United States. All by himself? When he didn't — and doesn't — know squat about how the government works?\nBob Woodward fills in with more facts. Trump has continued to consult with Putin, his mentor in all things dictatorial, as he did plenty of times when he was in office — and wouldn't let anyone listen in. He has had as many as seven calls with Putin since leaving the White House. Trump doesn't deny it.\nThat's when the slushy facts coalesced. My heart froze, too. Didn't we really know it all along? All those calls between Trump and Putin during Trump's administration? Putin tutoring Trump on how to install yes men and cronies in his government so that he can become a dictator?\nWhat are they plotting now, Putin and Trump?\nMARGARET BARTON DRIGGS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "GOP-linked PACs give millions to Hogan campaign\n\n October 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SHAUN CHORNOBROFF Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 931\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Despite having \"Republican\" under his name on Maryland's ballots, former Gov. Larry Hogan has been running for the U.S. Senate on the notion that he's more of an independent, someone who can work on either side of the political aisle.That messaging hasn't stopped Hogan's campaign from receiving significant campaign support from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, as well as two Republican senators vying to replace him as the next GOP Senate leader: John Cornyn of Texas and John Thune of South Dakota.\nHogan, who was recruited to run in the election by McConnell, is pitted against Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks in what is likely to be one of the country's most pivotal elections. The Maryland seat is being vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin.\nThe Hogan campaign declined to respond to questions by phone and email about the contributions.\nHogan's campaign has received more than $235,000, including a $75,000 contribution on Sept. 25, from the Cornyn Victory Committee, according to Federal Election Committee reports filed on Tuesday.\nPolitico reported that Thune's super PAC, New Heights Action, has given $1 million to PACs to help Hogan's campaign.\nNew Heights Action has given $750,000 to Maryland's Future, a super PAC supporting Hogan, according to the FEC filings.\nA McConnell-linked super PAC, Senate Leadership Fund, gave $2 million to Maryland's Future in July.\nMaryland's Future has been behind a wave of advertising engulfing the state and had $16 million left to spend as of Sept. 30.\nAt the end of September, Axios reported that WinSenate, a Democratic PAC linked to Chuck Schumer, was launching $1.1 million worth of ads for Alsobrooks over the first two weeks of this month.\nWith the aid of four independent senators who caucus with them, Democrats hold a two-seat advantage in the Senate. Hogan swinging a seat in Maryland, a deeply Democratic state, would represent a major political coup for the Republicans.\n\"I think there's always one race that people aren't paying attention to that we end up picking up. I think that could be Maryland this time,\" Cornyn said in a Sept. 24 conversation with Capital News Service.\nBoth Cornyn and Thune have flexed their well-established fundraising muscles as they, along with Rick Scott, R-Florida, seek to succeed McConnell, who is relinquishing his leadership post at the end of the year.\nOn Sept. 24, Cornyn sent out a letter to donors detailing that he has raised more than $400 million since he joined the Senate in 2002.\nThe Cornyn Victory Committee has raised nearly $16 million in this election cycle, according to Open Secrets. The money has been spread out among a number of candidates, with Hogan being near the middle of the group in terms of total donations from the Texan's PAC.\nThe Hill reported last month that Thune announced at a political strategy meeting that he would transfer $4 million from his personal campaign to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in an effort to chip away at the large fundraising advantage held by Democrats. The donation was the largest ever by a Senate Republican, doubling the previous record, set by Thune in 2016.\nThe Alsobrooks campaign has held a fundraising advantage over Hogan's campaign in recent months.\nAlsobrooks' principal campaign committee raised more than $13.4 million in the last cycle from July 1 through Sept. 30, significantly more than Hogan, whose campaign committee raised $3.3 million in the same period, according to FEC filings.\nBoth Hogan and Alsobrooks have joint fundraising arrangements with party committees that provide their campaigns with cash and raise money for the parties.\nThe Alsobrooks Victory Fund, created by her campaign and the Democratic State Central Committee of Maryland, raised nearly $3.8 million during the reporting period. Similarly, the Hogan Victory Fund, set up between his campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Campaign, raised $5.4 million.\nAlsobrooks' principal campaign committee had almost $3.4 million in cash on hand at the end of last month, while Hogan's principal committee reported nearly $1.6 million in cash on hand.\nHogan is Maryland's first two-term Republican governor in over 60 years and remains popular.\nA University of Maryland Baltimore poll released on Oct. 9 said 53% of likely Maryland voters had a favorable opinion of Hogan, compared to 49% for Alsobrooks.\nHowever, the poll gave Alsobrooks a nine-point lead in a race that was neck-and-neck only a month ago.\nSome analysts believe a major reason for Alsobrooks' advantage could be Hogan's party allegiance: the former governor is sharing the ticket with former President Donald Trump. Even though Trump endorsed him, Hogan is not returning the favor, saying he will not vote for the GOP standard-bearer.\nHogan's party ties were a major focus in his Oct. 10 debate with Alsobrooks, with the Prince George's county executive repeatedly warning of the dangers of a Republican-controlled Senate.\nMore than 30% of those surveyed in the UMBC poll cited either support for Democratic control of the Senate or reproductive rights as their reason for voting for Alsobrooks.\n\"We are facing an election where the future of our country and our freedoms are at stake,\" Alsobrooks said during the debate. \"The Republican Party has declared war on women's reproductive freedoms, we recognize that this party of chaos and division led by Donald Trump can not lead this country and also has severe consequences for Marylanders.\"\nThroughout the debate, Hogan characterized himself as someone who could overcome partisan politics.\n\"I think what we need desperately in Washington are people that are willing, that have the courage to put country over party and to put people over politics, and to stand up to the leaders of their party,\" Hogan said. \"I don't think there's anyone in America who has done that more than me.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I spent over 53 years working in the defense industry holding a top secret clearance. I know about proper handling of classified information and documents which is something Trump apparently does not.The fact that Trump illegally removed and held onto classified documents, some of them marked top secret, for years after he left the White House is deeply troubling. He was given three chances to return those documents (a consideration I would never have been given) and the fact that he refused and tried to obstruct their return led to the search for and seizure of those documents at Mar-A-Lago. This alone should disqualify him from any position or job that involves the handling of classified information.\nBut that's not all. In addition to those classified documents he hoarded in South Florida, he also shared, over the objection of the intelligence community, highly classified images of the Iranian missile attack on one of our bases in the Mid East, images that may have revealed capabilities (and perhaps vulnerabilities) of our systems that should not have been shared.\nHe also gave son-in-law Jared Kushner a top secret clearance, over the objections of the intelligence community, who felt that he would be subject to foreign influence because of his foreign business dealings. How many millions of dollars did Jared receive from the Middle East during Trump's tenure in office?\nThen there was that infamous meeting in Helsinki with Vladimir Putin in 2018 – the meeting for which no recordings, transcripts, or other records were made (at Trump's direction). One has to wonder what was discussed; what Trump promised Putin that would be damaging if revealed.\nAll of this demonstrates that Trump should absolutely be denied access to national secrets. Fact is, if Trump was an ordinary citizen, he would have a hard time obtaining a confidential (the lowest level) security clearance. Who do you want to hold the code for the nuclear weapons — someone who has shown us their blatant disregard for national security processes or someone who does understand and adhere to these processes for the safety of all?\nSTEVE SHIMKO\nSt. Michaels \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Oceans of money: Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, Democrats and Republicans all have something in common. They all love raking in record amounts of campaign cash.\n\n October 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG National Enter | Section: National \n \n 1248\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A record amount of money is flooding into the 2024 U.S. elections with a projected $15.9 billion expected to be spent on federal contests — including the White House race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris as well as key and expensive U.S. Senate races.And that bipartisan tsunami of cash doesn't even include the millions of dollars flowing into state ballot measures on abortion rights, marijuana legalization and other issues in states such as Montana and Florida.\nThe Center for Responsive Politics expects federal campaign spending to hit $15.9 billion this cycle — up from $15.1 billion in 2020.\nFederal campaign spending this presidential cycle is up 145% from 2016 when Trump defeated former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, when spending totaled $6.5 billion, and 152% from 2012 ($6.3 billion) — the first election after the U.S. Supreme Court loosened restrictions on outside groups' campaign spending in its Citizens United decision in 2010.\nHarris and groups aligned with her presidential campaign have raised more than $1.25 billion in the race against Trump, whose camp has raised close to $940 million.\nCarly Urban, an economics professor with Montana State University, said it has become more difficult to track campaign money since the Citizens United decision and the wider advent of so-called 'dark money' being funneled into elections.\n\"Those are a little bit trickier to track than regular PACs (political actions committees) were pre-2010,\" Urban said, referring to more secretive and anonymous groups and financial flows.\nShe also said the nature of campaign spending is changing away from just hiring staff and buying media advertisements.\n\"Now, we are seeing all types of different payments,\" Urban said, referring to campaigns paying social media influencers to promote candidates and messages.\nUrban said it is difficult to know how much influencers are getting paid by campaigns and whether there are 'pay for play' deals related to candidate appearances on popular podcasts\n.\"I'm sure there are payments going out,\" she said.\n{strong style=\"font-size: 1em \"}THOSE ENDLESS TEXTS{/strong}\nThroughout the campaign, Harris and Trump have both attended high-priced fundraisers with deep-pocketed donors and business executives in affluent bastions such as Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Beverly Hills, Silicon Valley, Big Sky, Montana, Martha's Vineyard and the Hamptons.\nSome of America's wealthiest persons are also giving big in the presidential race and are serving as high-profile surrogates.\nFor Trump, that includes Elon Musk, Dallas Mavericks owner Miriam Adelson, aerospace scion Robert Bigelow and Mellon heir Timothy Mellon (who has given $175 million to GOP groups this cycle).\nBill Gates, media billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Fred Eyhchaner, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and \"Shark Tank\" co-host Mark Cuban are in Harris' financial and political corner. Gates has reportedly given $50 million to the Harris camp.\nMadison Schroder, a political researcher at the University of Oregon, said Trump has been unique in his ability to drive fundraising from both supporters and opponents.\nShe said Trump has been able to draw support from big-fish donors and ball cap wearing, grassroots conservatives.\n\"He's made himself into a marketable product and he knows his customer base very well,\" Schroder said, referring to Trump's marketing of bibles, trading cards and other products associated with his name and campaign.\nIn the other corner, Harris and Democrats routinely fundraise off of their opposition to Trump.\nHarris was installed at the top of the Democratic ticket in August after President Joe Biden was pressured by party leaders and donors to quit the race. She saw a groundswell of campaign money after Biden's pressured exit.\nSchroder said social media and smartphones have helped propel more targeted and continuous fundraising texts and emails and a significant number of grassroots voters see contributions as a way to be part of the political process.\nThe last two Trump-dominated campaigns have seen $31 billion raised for federal races.\nBut Schroder wonders when voters will reach their tipping point when it comes to fundraising solicitations and wonders how much campaign money is enough.\n\"How much money do elections really need,\" Schroder said.\n\"What does this money really go to and why is it important,\" she continued, noting the access big donors gain from big donations.\nSENATE RACESThe 2024 cycle has also seen very expensive U.S. Senate races that will likely determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress.\nIn Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy is looking to unseat three-term incumbent Democrat U.S. Sen. Jon Tester in a contest that has totaled $242 million with more than $140 million streaming into Montana, according to FEC and CRP data as of Oct. 21.\nBoth Sheehy, a former U.S. Navy SEAL and founder of aerial firefighting company Bridger Aerospace, and Tester, a farmer who touts his Montana roots, both accuse the other of being bankrolled and beholden to billionaires and other wealthy interests.\nThe Sheehy camp points to backing for Tester from lobbyists as well as groups tied to left-wing financier George Soros. Democrats counter that the GOP challenger is supported by private equity interests including hedge fund manager Ken Griffin and Blackstone chairman and CEO Stephen Schwarzman.\nThe Montana race is only surpassed in terms of money by the Ohio U.S. Senate race where incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown is being challenged by GOP businessman Bernie Moreno.\nThe Ohio contest has a price tag approaching $345 million.\nBrown and Tester have raised $83.5 million and $77.9 million, respectively, according to the Federal Election Commission.\nThat's the most of any congressional candidates. Sheehy and Moreno have also put $2.45 million and $4.5 million of their own money, respectively, in the form of loans, into the race.\nEven in races where incumbents are expected to breeze to victory, sitting senators from both parties have amassed overflowing war chests.\nThat includes Democrats Amy Kloubachar of Minnesota ($20.9 million raised) and Maria Cantwell of Washington ($12.8 million) and Republicans Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee ($16.8 million) and John Barrasso of Wyoming ($10.2 million), according to FEC filings.\nBALLOT MEASURESState ballot measures are also drawing significant money.\nThe most expensive ballot campaign is in Florida where Amendment 3 would legalize marijuana for recreational use if it can overcome the state's 60% benchmark for initiative approvals.\nThe race has surpassed the $101 million mark with $60 million coming from the marijuana industry in support of the measure and opposition financed by Griffin and GOP donor Tricia Duggan.\nThere are also state ballot measures in Montana, Florida, Missouri, Arizona, Colorado and Nebraska that look to enshrine abortion rights into state constitutions after the U.S Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and sent the issue back to the states. Those measures have generated $125.7 million in campaign money with more than 88% of the money in those races backing abortion rights via support from national groups such as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, according to CRP.\nSome wealthy Democratic donors — including benefactor Marsha Zlatin Laufer and Cargill heiress Gwendolyn Sontheim Meyer and groups financed by Soros — are also bankrolling the abortion rights measures.\nIn Montana, a ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights has garnered in $11.9 million in campaign money, according to CRP. Almost all of that — $11.8 million — is from abortion rights supporters including contributions of $1 million from Sontheim Meyer, $1 million from Soros' Open Society Fund, $1.3 million from Michael Bloomberg, according to CFP and state campaign finance records.\nUrban said wealthy donors have become important drivers for and against state ballot measures in the post-Citizens United landscape.\nSchroder notes the influx of out-of-state money — whether it's grassroots activists or access-seeking mega-donors — into state ballot measures, including this cycle's bevy of abortion rights initiatives.\n\"People are seeing national political platforms as being state by state agendas, too,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Republicans predict victories at annual Talbot County Lincoln Reagan Dinner\n\n October 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Business \n \n 709\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — Speeches delivered at the annual Talbot County Republican Central Committee's annual Lincoln Reagan Dinner Thursday evening featured optimistic outlooks and strong calls to action for Republican voters ahead of this year's general election.About 100 Talbot County Republicans gathered at the Miles River Yacht Club to eat a meal, connect over shared interests, and hear from speakers including Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) and keynote speaker Ivan Raiklin, a pro-Trump Republican activist.\n\"I think Donald Trump is going to win,\" Harris said to the crowd, which featured several local leaders and prominent community members. \"His lead may be too big to rig, but they will still try. … The U.S. Senate I am really excited about because we are going to win the majority of the Senate, no question about it.\"\nHarris, who was recently made the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, encouraged the voters in the room to vote early in the 2024 election, expressing concerns about safety at the polls on Election Day. Early voting in Maryland began Oct. 24 and runs through Oct. 31.\nLater in the evening, Harris engaged with Raiklin during a question-and-answer session, during which the representative voiced support for North Carolina legislators allocating the state's presidential electors to Donald Trump, even before the popular vote is complete. In a video of the interaction, which Raiklin posted to his X account following the event, Harris said such a move \"makes a lot of sense\" in the wake of Hurricane Helene, which devastated western parts of the state.\nHaving North Carolina's legislature assign the state's 16 Electoral College votes has been proposed by some as a potential measure to combat voting difficulties in storm-ravaged areas. Harris said the move made less sense in other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, like New Hampshire and Arizona, which were identified by Raiklin in his keynote speech.\n\"It looks like just a power play,\" Harris said. \"In North Carolina, it's legitimate. There are a lot of people that aren't going to get to vote and it may make the difference in that state.\"\nHarris said in a statement sent to media outlets Friday that \"every legal vote should be counted. I would hope everyone could agree that legal American voters whose lives were devastated by the recent storms should not be disenfranchised in the upcoming voting process.\"\nThe interaction has garnered a lot of buzz on the internet, as has Raiklin's keynote speech from the event, which was posted in full to his X account Thursday evening.\nRaiklin gave a multimedia talk at the event. He is a former Green Beret, has a constitutional law degree and has been an intelligence officer. He calls himself a \"deep state marauder.\" He has appeared on Tucker Carlson's blog and Alex Jones' InfoWars.\n\"Everybody here has courage,\" Raiklin said to the Republicans gathered in Talbot County. \"At some point in time, you decided enough was enough and it's time to stop the tyrannical federal government overreach.\"\nThe event stirred emotions. According to Talbot County Sheriff's Office report, Ferdinand Joseph Ricci, 58, of Alexandria, Virginia assaulted another attendee in front of Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble, a Republican who was attending the event. The Sheriff's Office said Ricci was charged with assault and taken to the Talbot County Central Booking facility after being removed from the dinner. It was unclear if he was an attendee of the event or there to protest it.\nBut this did not dampen the attitudes of the attendees of the dinner, many of whom expressed optimism about election outcomes in the final weeks of the 2024 election cycle.\nGordana Schifanelli, a lawyer who ran to be lieutenant governor with Dan Cox, said, \"I think the Republican Party is exceptionally energized and educated this time around… I am concerned the Democrats will be throwing a fit, burning and looting. I am concerned about the violence that could ensue if they don't get their way.\"\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) quoted Abraham Lincoln in his speech to the crowd, one of the annual dinner's namesakes, and said, \"We of the Republican Party have a special debt of gratitude to Abraham Lincoln. It was his sincere belief and unfailing devotion to a great principle which brought into being a new political pledge to make all men free and equal.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Consider the party platforms\n\n October 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 253\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Rather than deciding on one individual versus another, voters might instead consider party platforms and party methods of governing.One party tends to attract those engaged in commercial endeavors that must earn a profit. The other is dominated by those inside mostly non-profit entities whose funding is essentially unearned. These include university academics and their students, social cause activists, information technology groups and media providers. This party believes there are grand ideas for addressing real or imaginary problems.\nIn view of these distinctions, the two parties are motivated toward different ends. One party seeks a government that promotes free enterprise with only necessary regulations. The other is motivated to gain control of the government in order to implement grand ideas.\nIt seems that one party supports classical Constitutional freedom while the other seeks to impose a new system that circumvents Constitutional strictures. The 2024 Democratic Party platform states that \"America is an idea.\"\n\"We must right the wrongs in our democracy, redress the systemic injustices that have long plagued our society, throw open the doors of opportunity for all Americans, and reinvent our institutions at home and our leadership abroad.

She defined the problem with the Democrat party very well. She points with one finger and has three pointing back at her. Have any of those who are considering voting for Kamala listened to her stuttering and stammering during an interview. She and Joe have been in charge for nearly four years and darn near destroyed this country.Now she wants to fix what is broke, and she is the one who broke it. If it were something that Trump broke, she had 3½ years to fix it. Why didn't she? Even CNN and ABC are getting frustrated with her handling of simple questions. Every time she is asked a question about anything she blames Trump. It is way past time for people to vote with common sense not for the party that promises and does not deliver.\nTrump delivered on his promise for lower fuel and gas prices and was working on closing our borders, low inflation and putting more people to work (blacks had the lowest unemployment during his term). He wants this country to prosper.\nIf you have ever listened to Kamala speak, try to imagine her with any dignitary. It would be disastrous. All I ask is that you use your brain this time and vote for Donald J. Trump.\nJOHN GONDECK\nDenton \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I will strongly support and vote for Kamala Harris and Angela Alsobrooks. I believe they are the right choices for our country and for Maryland. I encourage all of you to do the same, even Republicans who may never vote for a Democrat again except now.For anyone who is considering voting for Donald Trump be very careful. Donald Trump is not who he was. He is not the person who ran in 2016. He is mentally challenged and very, very, radical. This is clear from his consistent, unclear and unintelligible statements at his rallies. If you want proof of that just go to one of them. The rallies are so bad that even Fox News has not shown them because Trump looks so bad.\nHe recently canceled several interviews because he was quote \"too tired.\" This is a man who has lost his way and tries to cover it by using foul language as he did at the recent Al Smith dinner in New York.\nDonald Trump is a great danger to our country and will do nothing but help his billionaire friends like Elon Musk; he will take revenge on anyone he thinks was or is against him. He has told us that — believe him. He will try very hard to become a dictator. He has told us that — believe him.\nDonald Trump has denigrated our military and called them \"losers and suckers.\" He has vilified John McCain, a patriot who spent years in a prisoner of war camp fighting for our country. Now he wants to be commander in chief. Gen. John Kelly, Trump's former chief of staff, courageously and at great personal peril if Trump is elected, said publicly this week that Trump meets the definition of \"fascist.\" When a four-star Marine general fears for our country, we should as well.\nAll of us must vote in the next several days. I appeal to you to think very, very, carefully about who gets your precious vote. I truly believe that we cannot let Donald Trump into the White House because if we do our American democracy will end. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Big surprise'?: Anti-war vote could be a wild card in razor-thin Trump-Harris race\n\n October 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Belgrade News | Section: News \n \n 1590\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Could anti-war voters (including Muslims and Arab-American Christians) upset with U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas potentially tip the 2024 election away from Vice President Kamala Harris in favor of former President Donald Trump?In 2020, President Joe Biden won 69% of the Muslim vote, compared to Trump's 17%, according to Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). Exit polls by the Associated Press in 2020 gave Biden 64% of the Muslim vote versus 35% for Trump.\nTimes have changed.\nThe Biden-Harris administration's military and diplomatic support for Israel's war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks and ongoing conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon have eroded Arab-American and Muslim support for Harris' White House bid.\nMore than 43,000 people have died in Gaza since the start of the war more than a year ago, when Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis and took more than 250 hostages. More than 100 of those Israeli hostages (including a handful with dual American citizenship) are still being held by Hamas and other Islamic militants.\nIsrael's continued siege and bombings inside Gaza have killed more than 20,000 women and children, according to the United Nations, citing Palestinian estimates.\nA worst-case scenario for Harris is that Muslim voters, Arab American Christians and other anti-war voters (including younger voters) back the Green Party's Jill Stein (who opposes the war and U.S. backing of Israel), Trump or sit out the election, which could potentially tilt the razor-thin election in battlegrounds including Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina.\nSEISMIC SHIFT?A national poll released last month by the Arab American Institute found Arab Americans shifting away from Democrats and Harris.\nThe group said in the past Arab Americans voted for Democrats by a roughly 2-to-1 margin.\nThe October poll found Trump leading Harris among Arab Americans 42% to 41%, with 12% backing a third-party candidate such as Stein or Cornel West, who also opposes the Gaza war.\nHarris is polling 18 percentage points below Biden's 2020 standing with Arab Americans, according to the poll.\n\"In our 30 years of polling Arab American voters, we have not witnessed anything like the role that the war on Gaza is having on voter behavior,\" said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, in a statement, pointing out 81% of Arab Americans view the Israel-Hamas war as a top issue.\nThere are more than 3.7 million Arab Americans in the U.S., according to AAI.\nClose to 393,000 Arab Americans live in Michigan (which Biden won by just over 154,100 votes in 2020). Another 126,500 live in Pennsylvania (which Biden won by more than 78,500 votes).\nAAI estimates two-thirds or more of Arab Americans are Christians, while one-quarter are Muslim.\nWhile Evangelical Christians are among the staunchest supporters of Israel, Orthodox, the Roman Catholic Church and more liberal Protestant denominations — which also have churches in the Holy Land — have pressed for an end to the war and criticized Israel's Gaza bombings and invasion as it seeks to eradicate Hamas.\nAnother poll released earlier this month by the Arab News and polling firm YouGov gives Trump a 45% to 43% lead over Harris among Arab American voters. Stein gets 4%.\n'BITTER PILL'\nLate August polls by the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) showed Harris getting 28% of the Muslim vote in six key Electoral College swing states, compared to 30% for Stein and 15% for Trump.\nThe CAIR poll gave Harris 12% of the Muslim vote in Michigan (a key swing state with a significant Arab-American population) versus 40% for Stein and 18% for Trump.\nRobert McCaw, government affairs director for CAIR, said Harris hurt her standing with Muslim voters with recent pronouncements that she wouldn't change anything about the Biden administration policies.\n\"She stands by the policy of providing Israel with U.S manufactured weapons,\" McCaw said.\n\"It's a bitter pill for Muslim voters to swallow,\" he continued.\nMcCaw said if margins are tight in the presidential race or key Senate contests, anti-war voters could tip the balance. He also said like any group, Muslim voters can look to other issues, including the economy and social matters. He warns candidates not to take them for granted with Gaza in the backdrop.\n\"They could be in for a big surprise,\" he said.\n'VITAL VOTES'\nOne leading anti-war group, Abandon Harris, has endorsed Stein.\nHudhayfah Ahmad, spokesman for the group, said the U.S. administration's \"disregard for Palestinian lives has deeply damaged Harris's credibility with a large bloc of voters, including Muslims, progressives and human rights advocates.\"\n\"Their votes are vital in this election, and with each bomb dropped in Gaza, Harris's candidacy suffers more,\" he said.\nHarris — who has been heckled by anti-war protesters at some campaign rallies and TV appearances — has tried to walk a political balance beam of supporting Israel's right to defend itself after the Hamas attacks and continued rockets from Hezbollah while calling for a ceasefire. She also snubbed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress in August, and did meet with him at the White House voicing concerns about war deaths.\nHarris told CBS News Saturday the U.S. would help defend Israel if Iran strikes back after Israel Defense Forces bombed installations in Iran on Friday.\nAhmad is frustrated with the year-long cycle of top U.S. administration officials, including Harris, calling for and talking up a ceasefire and occasionally criticizing Netanyahu, only to see truce talks falter, coupled with White House and Pentagon pronouncements of \"ironclad support for Israel\" and continued military support.\n\"This cycle of empty calls for a ceasefire, followed by a new round of munitions shipments, has become insulting to Muslim voters and others who care about ending the massacres. It's a hollow strategy that tries to pacify the public, while enabling the very acts they claim to denounce. People are tired of the hypocrisy,\" Ahmad said.\nNO FANS OF TRUMPHarris does enjoy backing from Emgage Action, a Muslim group advocacy group that backed Biden in 2020.\nEmgage CEO Wa'el Alzayat said \"Gaza has been completely destroyed, tens of thousands of civilians have been killed, including many children, and a population of two million has been destitute.\"\nBut Alzayat said voting for a third-party candidate will help Trump win the White House.\n\"Muslims do not need to be reminded of who Donald Trump is,\" Alzayat said, pointing to the travel bans he proposed from several Muslim countries, moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and backing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights.\nAlzayat said Trump also \"blessed Netanyahu's expansionism by recognizing Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights\" and has promised support for Netanyahu on the campaign trail. He sees more hope in Harris, despite her standing by Biden's war stance.\nAhmad is also no fan of Trump.\n\"Trump's record on Palestine is disastrous — he's championed Israeli expansion and disregarded Palestinian rights altogether. Muslim voters have every reason to distrust him on this issue,\" he said.\nA national poll by The Economist and YouGov shows 36% of Americans sympathize with Israel in the war, 17% back the Palestinians, 25% have equal allegiances and 22% aren't sure. More than two-thirds of conservatives and 45% of wealthy voters back Israel, according to the survey.\nThe same poll shows 32% of Americans believe Israel is committing genocide in in Gaza, while 35% say they aren't and 32% aren't sure.\n'PEACE, NOT WAR'Trump has promised strong support for Israel and is backed by pro-Israeli mega-donor Miriam Adelson and other pro-Israel advocates including billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Eighty two percent of white Evangelical Christians — who are among the strongest backers of Israel — support Trump.\nBut he has also vowed to end the Holy Land war, as well as the war between Russia and Ukraine.\nTrump had a group of Muslim leaders and imams — including Dearborn Heights, Michigan Mayor Bill Bazzi — on stage with him during a rally in Michigan on Saturday, welcoming their support.\n\"We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace, not war,\" said Imam Belal Alzuhairi. \"We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine. The bloodshed has to stop all over the world, and I think this man can make that happen. I personally believe that God saved his life twice for a reason.\"\nTrump has also promised global protections for Christians, promising support for Coptic Christians in the Middle East and pointing to the sectarian dispute between Orthodox Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis.\nThe U.S. provides $3.8 billion in military aid to Israel annually. The Biden-Harris administration backed a $14 billion war aid package and approved a $20 billion long-term weapons sale to Israel earlier this year, and has sent troops, weapons, fighter jets and naval assets during the war with Hamas and Hezbollah and skirmishes with Iran.\nThose efforts enjoy bipartisan support. Still, Republicans, including U.S. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, as well as Trump, argue Biden and Harris have not been supportive enough of Israel.\nTrump is also courting Jewish voters, another traditional Democratic voting bloc, and has touted his communications with Netanyahu. Jewish voters backed Biden over Trump by a 68% to 30% margin in 2020, according to the Jewish Virtual Library.\nA poll this month by academic research group CHIP50 found some slippage, with Harris holding a 54% to 36% lead over Trump among Jewish voters. A new poll by Channel 12 TV in Israel shows 66% of Israelis back Trump in the U.S. election versus 17% for Harris. More than 90% of Netanyahu backers prefer Trump over Harris, according to the Israeli poll.\nThis comes as Harris and Democrats press the case that Trump is a fascist who admires Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.\n\"I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite of a Nazi,\" Trump told a campaign rally Monday in Atlanta. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Election Day looms: How will the counts go and will voters trust the process - and the results?\n\n October 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Belgrade News | Section: News \n \n 1220\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Tuesday's election — which has already seen significant early voting across the country and could see record turnout spurred by the neck-and-neck White House race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris — will also be a serious test of how much trust the public has in the election system and the government agencies who run it.Right now, those trust levels skew along partisan lines.\nA Pew Research Center Poll released Oct. 24 found 42% of Trump voters are not confident the election will run smoothly compared to 90% of Harris voters who trust the system.\nAccording to a Pew survey, 38% of Trump voters have confidence in the counting of mail-in and absentee votes compared to 85% of Harris voters who trust government agencies and poll workers counting the votes.\nClose to three-quarters of Harris voters (72%) versus less than one-third of Trump backers (32%) are confident the election system is secure against being hacked.\nThere is also plenty of curiosity — and some concerns — over how and when ballots will be counted and when winners might be determined not only in the presidential race but also key congressional contests and state ballot measures.\nTrump has disputed his 2020 loss to President Joe Biden. Trump led in key battleground states on election night, but Biden overcame those deficits via ensuring counts of mail-in and absentee ballots in the election which occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA number of state and local election agencies have increased security protocols and added more transparency to how ballots are tabulated and secured.\nOthers are counting absentee, mail-in and other early ballots early this cycle to help get results quicker and avoid delays that could fuel worries about how votes are being counted and results. .\nStill, barring some unforeseen turnout trends and definitive exit polls, a winner in the presidential race and other key races are not expected on election night or early Wednesday morning.\nIn Maryland, polls will be open Tuesday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Key races include the U.S. Senate race between former Republican governor Larry Hogan and Democratic Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks. GOP U.S. Rep. Andy Harris is being challenged for his Eastern Shore congressional by Democrat Blane Miller.\n'COUNTING DOESN'T STOP'In Pitt County, North Carolina near the Atlantic coast, County Elections Director Dave Davis said approved absentee ballot envelopes are fed into voting machines weekly in the run-up to the election.\nHe said the county has sent out more than 4,100 absentee ballots this year. Close to 87,600 people voted in the 2020 presidential race.\nDavis wouldn't talk about election security measures but said \"counting doesn't stop\" until all ballots are tallied.\nNorth Carolina is one of the key Electoral College battlegrounds between Trump and Harris, and there is some consternation about how long it will take for all votes to be counted in places such as Maricopa County in Arizona. That county, which includes Phoenix and Scottsdale, has a two-page ballot which could add to its already cumbersome counting of early ballots.\nThe Wisconsin State Board of Elections says all ballots — including in-person and absentee votes — are counted on Election Day and matched to voter registration details in poll books.\n\"All ballots are counted on Election Day,\" the state agency says in an explainer on vote counts.\nPennsylvania also does not count absentee ballots until Election Day.\nAnother key battleground, Michigan, has expanded early voting efforts with early voting centers open and is allowing local clerks to count them ahead of time — though results will not be posted until election night.\nSTORED IN A VAULTIn Montana (where there is a key U.S. Senate race and ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution), Gallatin County — which includes Bozeman, Big Sky and Belgrade — will count some absentee votes on Monday as allowed by state law, according to Eric Semerad, who serves as county clerk and elections administrator.\n\"We will start counting ballots on Monday, Nov. 4. State law allows counties of our size to start counting the day before Election Day, but only until 5 p.m.,\" Semerad said. \"We will then start counting again the morning of Election Day and won't stop until we are finished. Likely this will be sometime late Wednesday.\"\nHe said 63,500 absentee ballots have been sent out for this election. Close to 71,000 people voted in Gallatin County in 2020.\nSemerad did outline some of the procedures and security measures for counting and securing ballots.\n\"We will begin opening the secrecy envelopes and removing the ballots on Thursday, October 31st,\" he said. \"All ballots that are opened are kept in large security bags by ballot style which are sealed every night with numbered seals that are logged every time they are sealed or unsealed. Ballots are stored in our office vault that is monitored by a security camera.\"\nState law requires localities to keep counting voting ballots election night.\nSemerad said the first set of unofficial results won't be posted online until all voters have finished voting. Voting could continue after polls close if there are long lines.\n'CHAIN OF CUSTODY'In Florida, there are ballot measures to legalize marijuana for recreational use and to codify abortion rights into the state constitution superseding state restrictions passed after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\nUnder state law, those measures have to get more than 60% of the vote.\nLeah Valenti, supervisor of elections in Charlotte County in southwest Florida, also ran through some of the processes and protocols for counting early mail-in ballots.\nCharlotte County — which includes Punta Gorda and Port Charlotte — has sent out more than 45,000 mall-in ballots, Valenti said. More than 116,500 voters cast ballots in the county in 2020.\nShe said mail-in ballots are date-stamped, voters' identities are confirmed and ballot envelopes are batched and counts are reconciled daily.\nThey are stored in a secured room.\n\"Unlike the other office doors which have key card access (RFID), the mail ballots are stored in a dual authenticated secure room, which is under video surveillance. The ballots are stored there until they are opened and counted during a public meeting of the Canvassing Board,\" Valenti said.\nShe said voting equipment goes through accuracy testing before ballots are tallied, a new auditing system is being deployed this year and there other \"election integrity protocols.\"\n\"For instance, any time election materials are transported, two election workers from opposing political parties are required to sign off on chain of custody forms. This ensures transparency and accountability from all sides,\" Valenti said.\nNOT CONNECTEDIn Oregon (where all ballots are submitted by mail), Rochelle Long, Klamath County Clerk in the southern part of the state, said counts are done daily leading up to the election with results posted starting election night.\nKlamath County has sent out more than 51,500 ballots for the general election. Just over 36,700 voters cast ballots in the 2020 presidential race in the more rural and conservative county, where Trump carried close to 69% of the vote.\nLong said the voting counting process is public and can be seen on livestream in a number of Oregon jurisdictions. There are also safeguards, including multi-party presence during vote counts and transparency for the machine that tallies votes.\n\"The tally machine is not connected to any outside network,\" she said. \"The vote tally machine is in a locked room on camera and can be viewed publicly via live stream.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Election Day looms: How will the counts go and will voters trust the process - and the results?\n\n October 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Belgrade News | Section: News \n \n 1169\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Tuesday's election — which is already seeing significant early voting across the country and could see record turnout spurred by the neck-and-neck White House race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris — will also be a serious test of how much trust the public has in the election system and the government agencies who run it.Right now, those trust levels skew along partisan lines.\nA Pew Research Center Poll released Oct. 24 found 42% of Trump voters are not confident the election will run smoothly compared to 90% of Harris voters who trust the system.\nAccording to a Pew survey, 38% of Trump voters have confidence in the counting of mail-in and absentee votes compared to 85% of Harris voters who trust government agencies and poll workers counting the votes.\nClose to three-quarters of Harris voters (72%) versus less than one-third of Trump backers (32%) are confident the election system is secure against being hacked.\nThere is also plenty of curiosity — and some concerns — over how and when ballots will be counted and when winners might be determined not only in the presidential race but also key congressional contests and state ballot measures.\nTrump has disputed his 2020 loss to President Joe Biden. Trump led in key battleground states on election night, but Biden overcame those deficits via ensuring counts of mail-in and absentee ballots in the election which occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA number of state and local election agencies have increased security protocols and added more transparency to how ballots are tabulated and secured.\nOthers are counting absentee, mail-in and other early ballots early this cycle to help get results quicker and avoid delays that could fuel worries about how votes are being counted and results. .\nStill, barring some unforeseen turnout trends and definitive exit polls, a winner in the presidential race and other key races are not expected on election night or early Wednesday morning.\n'COUNTING DOESN'T STOP'In Pitt County, North Carolina near the Atlantic coast, County Elections Director Dave Davis said approved absentee ballot envelopes are fed into voting machines weekly in the run-up to the election.\nHe said the county has sent out more than 4,100 absentee ballots this year. Close to 87,600 people voted in the 2020 presidential race.\nDavis wouldn't talk about election security measures but said \"counting doesn't stop\" until all ballots are tallied.\nNorth Carolina is one of the key Electoral College battlegrounds between Trump and Harris, and there is some consternation about how long it will take for all votes to be counted in places such as Maricopa County in Arizona. That county, which includes Phoenix and Scottsdale, has a two-page ballot which could add to its already cumbersome counting of early ballots.\nThe Wisconsin State Board of Elections says all ballots — including in-person and absentee votes — are counted on Election Day and matched to voter registration details in poll books.\n\"All ballots are counted on Election Day,\" the state agency says in an explainer on vote counts.\nPennsylvania also does not count absentee ballots until Election Day.\nAnother key battleground, Michigan, has expanded early voting efforts with early voting centers open and is allowing local clerks to count them ahead of time — though results will not be posted until election night.\nSTORED\nIN A VAULT\nIn Montana (where there is a key U.S. Senate race and ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution), Gallatin County — which includes Bozeman, Big Sky and Belgrade — will count some absentee votes on Monday as allowed by state law, according to Eric Semerad, who serves as county clerk and elections administrator.\n\"We will start counting ballots on Monday, Nov. 4. State law allows counties of our size to start counting the day before Election Day, but only until 5 p.m.,\" Semerad said. \"We will then start counting again the morning of Election Day and won't stop until we are finished.

Ballots are stored in our office vault that is monitored by a security camera.\"\nState law requires localities to keep counting voting ballots election night.\nSemerad said the first set of unofficial results won't be posted online until all voters have finished voting.

According to the speakers, Americans hate other Americans. They sought to set neighbor against neighbor. That seems to be the party line. Who are them and who are us? This just isn't the world that I was brought up or believe in. So what do I believe?My father fought in World War II against the Nazis. My parents brought us up to stand up for our country and to do what was right for other people. They taught us to try and live with honor and integrity. I do not recognize the Republican Party. They stand for nothing but to bow to Trump. As Tom Stoppard sings, \" You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything.\"\nI reject the idea that persons of color are inferior to white people, that persons who are not Christian are inferior or unacceptable, that women are inferior to men, or that other people are not free to love as they wish. This election is about personal freedom versus having personal decisions made by our government or someone else who paternalistically are sure that they know what is better for us than we do.\nTrump's rhetoric about vermin, the enemy within, the enemy of the people is straight out of the Nazi playbook. If you vote for him you are giving up your power to him. He has talked about suspending the Constitution. I sense that some people think that what he is going to do won't affect them. A famous quote from a German citizen who was eventually placed in a concentration camp basically says that when they came for the trade unionists and then for the Jews he didn't speak up and when they came for him there was no one to speak for him. That's what will happen.\nOne will not be able to freely express his opinion because there will be someone who will overhear and \"turn them in.\" Think it can't happen here? History tells us differently. Wake up. Trump wants to take away your power.\nFrom a registered Republican. Listen, think and vote for democracy. Otherwise you will no longer have a voice to complain about our government or vote again.\nLINDA BLYTHE\nBozman \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Chief Judge Shawn Howeth said it had been busy at the fire department since 7 a.m. He said there were a lot of new voters.\n\"People are passionate about this election, I guess,\" Howeth said.\nGoing into election night, at the national level, Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris faced Republican candidate former President Donald Trump.\nAt the state level, Democratic candidate and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks vied with former Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan for retiring Sen. Ben Cardin's (D-Md.) seat.\nOn the Eastern Shore, incumbent Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md. 1st) faced Democratic candidate Blane Miller III and Libertarian candidate Joshua O'Brien for the Congressional District 1 seat.\nDepending on the county, some Mid-Shore ballots also had board of education races on them.\nAt some polling locations, local Democratic and Republican committees had tables and tents set up, ready to talk to voters.\nTalbot County Republican Central Committee member Shari Wilcoxon said she had been outside the Easton Volunteer Fire Department for hours talking with voters.\n\"I'm feeling extremely positive,\" she said. \"Because I'm getting so many thumbs up. And I'm also getting so many fully-educated voters that know what's on the ballot.\"\nCaroline County Republican Central Committee Chairman Julie Quick said people had been coming over to their tent at the Denton Volunteer Fire Company to take pictures with a cardboard cutout of Trump.\n\"I have (heard) lots about the direction of our country and how important this election is,\" she said. \"That is why we are here.\"\nOutside the Talbot County Community Center, Judy Wixted handed out voter guides with the Talbot County Democratic Central Committee. Wixted said she was feeling good about the Talbot County elections and was feeling \"cautiously optimistic\" about the national elections.\n\"What I know is a truth is, in close elections, ground game wins,\" Wixted said. \"And I really believe that the Harris Walz campaign has the best ground game I have seen since Barack Obama.\"\nTalbot County voter Donna Young said she considers this one of the most important elections she's voted in.\n\"Because women's rights are being taken away from them left and right, and nobody seems to care,\" she said.\nMultiple voters talked about the importance of the single state-wide question on the ballot, which asks voters whether the Declaration of Rights in the Maryland Constitution should be amended to add a new section that guarantees a right to \"reproductive freedom.\"\nTalbot County voter Alecia Weaver said her \"main thing\" is voting against adding this section.\n\"Because I don't believe in abortion,\" she said. \"I don't believe in killing babies.\"\nDorchester County voter Beverly Mundorf said inflation, crime and borders were the most important issues to her going into the election. She said she is excited for Trump. Mundorf also said she is excited for Andy Harris, who she said does a lot for the Eastern Shore, an area that can often get overlooked.\nAaron Woolford, a Dorchester County voter, said he is worried about how the world could change if Trump is elected. He said he thinks it could make life harder for himself and other Black Americans.\nEd Weaver, who is registered as an independent, voted for Trump. He said he sees Trump as \"the better of two evils.\"\n\"Candidates, they really don't talk about the issues,\" he said. \"All you hear is just a smear campaign.\" Weaver said this has made it more challenging when it comes to making voting decisions.\nTalbot County voter Brendan Wazniak — who considers himself an independent — said he voted blue in the presidential, senate and congressional races but said he didn't think there were any \"perfect\" candidates.\n\"I think a lot of the people probably feel that way as well,\" he said. \"So, yeah, it does make it a little bit difficult.\"\nFor updated results in local and state races, visit stardem.com.

    "content": "Dorchester Republicans, eager for change, rally behind Trump as results come in\n\n November 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 660\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — As Sen. Johnny Mautz said his goodbyes just before 9 p.m. at a Tuesday night Dorchester Republican Central Committee watch party, he left saying the three words that became a rallying cry this election cycle for Donald Trump's presidential campaign — \"fight, fight, fight.\"Attendees cheered and carried on that optimism before calling it a night, just hours before the former president claimed victory over Democratic opponent Kamala Harris. While some sighed in disappointment when Democrat Angela Alsobrooks clinched the U.S. Senate seat over Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan, the hopes for a Donald Trump victory remained high.\nEarlier Tuesday evening, Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) implored around 30 Republicans gathered for the watch party in a Bay Country Security garage to carry on the values and messages of the Republican Party — no matter the eventual results.\n\"That message has got to carry on, whether it's one house, two houses, all three, or God forbid, none,\" Mautz said. \"We've got to be prepared for whatever is coming to us, because there is no walking away. There's no ignoring the reality of the division that's in our country right now.\"\n\"Make sure we just keep pounding home the priorities and the principles of what our country is founded on, and we're going to succeed,\" he continued. \"And we'll do it because of you guys.\"\nBill Travers, from East New Market, voted for Trump and felt optimistic while watching the race. He paid close attention to the swing states as numbers came in, standing up to celebrate when he saw Trump hold leads in Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, three states the Republican candidate later won.\nTravers said his support for the former president was never in doubt. He wants to see change in office, disappointed with the country's trajectory under President Joe Biden.\n\"It's a no-brainer,\" Travers said. \"We need new leadership.\"\nWhile Travers thinks Trump \"needs to be a little more humble,\" he said the president-elect aligns with his stance against abortion as well as alleviating his concerns regarding gas prices and interest rates.\nTyler Sears, a 17-year-old from Dorchester County, watched closely, with future college endeavors and worries about paying bills among the practical issues on his mind. When asked if he felt the national election would impact his immediate future, Sears said \"without a doubt.\"\nThe high school senior saw Trump as the candidate who would most benefit him moving forward, saying he likely would've voted Trump if he was 18.\n\"I'm praying it's Trump,\" Sears said.\nMany hoped Tuesday's election would bring not just a second Trump presidency, but a calming in political division.\nCambridge resident Sandra Potter, 79, was rooting for Trump. She said she's \"never seen an election like this,\" noting the divisiveness it's created and the relationships with friends and family it's splintered.\nTwo of her children, one a Democrat and one a Republican, disagreed with one another this cycle but still remained on friendly terms. That's something Potter wants to see on a larger scale.\n\"It's time we pick ourselves up by the bootstraps and move forward,\" Potter said. \" … I hope we never see this discord again. I hope we learn from this election.\"\nThough the watch party's focus was largely directed at the presidential battle, Mautz said in an interview that he noticed a \"super high level of attention\" on local and national races on Election Day.\n\"I think the intensity of the national election has intensified all of the candidacies,\" Mautz said.\nAs the night grew older, members of the Dorchester County Republican Central Committee and local Republicans celebrated Trump's win in Texas, with one attendee shouting, \"God bless Texas.\" It gave Trump a 178-113 lead in the electoral college, an advantage he never relinquished.\nAdorned in a camo 'Ultra MAGA' cap, Potter vowed that despite what she views as tiring political rhetoric from both sides of the aisle, Trump was her preferred choice to assume the role as the country's next commander-in-chief.\n\"I think he does absolutely take care of our country,\" Potter said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Many election results known by Wednesday, some races still awaiting final counts\n\n November 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WENDY WEITZEL wweitzel@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 652\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Election night produced some decisive victories on the Mid-Shore, in Maryland and throughout the nation. Despite predictions that it may take several days before results were known, by Wednesday morning, many races had been called, though some ballots remained to be counted.Donald Trump secured his presidential victory when Wisconsin was called in the early hours of Wednesday, culminating the former president's comeback campaign that outperformed expectations.\nGoing into election night, many predicted it might take days for the results of the presidential election to be tallied. Trump performed better than he did during the 2020 election against President Joe Biden. His Democratic opponent for the seat, Kamala Harris, was unable to carry the necessary votes in swing states to secure her victory.\n\"I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president,\" Trump told cheering supporters in Mar a Lago, Florida, Tuesday night before his victory was confirmed.\nIn the closely watched race to replace outgoing U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Democrat Angela Alsobrooks faced Republican Larry Hogan, a former Maryland governor. The race was expected to be close going into election night, but the Associated Press called the race for Alsobrooks just hours after polls closed in the state.\nAlsobrooks, the current Prince George's County executive, took the lead as precincts began reporting results Tuesday night. With nearly all precincts reporting, as of Wednesday she had collected about 52% of votes to Hogan's 45%, a wide enough margin that the remaining mail-in and provisional ballots to be tallied will not change the outcome.\nAlsobrooks' victory marked a historic moment for the state — the election of its first Black female senator. She, along with Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, will join only a handful of Black women who have served in the office when she takes her oath of office in January.\n\"Now, it's remarkable to think that in two years, America will celebrate its 250th birthday, and in all those years, there have been more than 2,000 people who have served in the United States Senate, and only three have looked like me,\" Alsobrooks said on stage at her watch party in College Park Tuesday night.\nU.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) secured his reelection to Maryland's 1st District Congressional seat, a position he has held since 2010.\nHarris, who represents the Eastern Shore, had secured 62.8% of the vote in his race as of Wednesday morning, defeating Democratic challenger Blane Miller. About 82% of ballots in the district had been counted at that time.\nBut while some victories were able to be called, others need to wait until more ballots have been canvassed. In Maryland, election judges will tally remaining mail-in and provisional ballots over the next few weeks.\nAmong the races still too close to definitively call are all three Talbot County Board of Education races. Cynthia Marrah Jurrius led the District 6 race by just 46 votes as of Wednesday morning. The county's other Board of Education races had only a few hundred votes separating the candidates.\nAfter polls closed at 8 p.m. Tuesday, unofficial votes from the day were made available on the state board of elections website. Those results included early voting totals, mail-in ballots canvassed prior to Election Day and vote tallies from Tuesday.\nProvisional ballots will be canvassed on Wednesday, Nov. 13. Counting of mail-in ballots ends on Friday, Nov. 15.\nThere were more than 6,000 mail-in ballots requested in Talbot County, of which 3,273 had been accepted as of Tuesday. In Caroline County, more than 2,400 mail-in ballots were requested and 880 had been accepted. More than 3,300 mail-in ballots were sent to Dorchester County voters. Dorchester County will not begin canvassing mail-in votes until Thursday.\nOfficial verification of the vote count and certification of Maryland's election is scheduled for Nov. 15. Statewide certification is expected by Dec. 5, within 30 days of the election, as required by law.\nJesse Yeatman contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'I felt like everything was better': What drove voters explains why Trump won the day\n\n November 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG Media | Section: National \n \n 1080\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Across the country — in battlegrounds and partisan bastions — the motivators for voters were clear and distinct on Election Day.For supporters of now President-elect Donald Trump, economic concerns, especially inflation, were the driving factors along with worries about illegal immigration.\nFor backers of Vice President Kamala Harris, who would have been the first female U.S. president, support for abortion rights and views that Trump is a \"threat to democracy\" topped their motivations.\nIn the end, bread and butter worries helped Trump win the day, according to exit polls and interviews with voters across the country. Two-thirds of voters in pre-election and Election Day surveys gave the current economy poor marks, with prices more than 21% higher since President Joe Biden and Harris took office and 23% since COVID.\nTrump won the lion's share of those votes fueling his return to the White House.\nEstee Felsch said she voted for Trump on Tuesday after waiting in line for 90 minutes in Logan, Utah, because she felt the economy was better and prices were lower during his term in office.\n\"I don't really love either candidate for president, to be honest,\" she said. \"But I did vote for Trump because I felt like everything was better when he was in office.\"\nThat was a common refrain from Trump voters. They felt the economy was better and prices were lower during his term compared to the current Biden-Harris administration.\n\"I liked it the first go around,\" said Jon Anderson, a Trump voter on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\nExit polls showed as many as 70% of voters think the country is headed in the wrong direction, with many voters beleaguered by post-pandemic inflation and longer-term decline in wages and careers for working-class households.\nKathy Bronson, who is retired and living in southwest Florida, voted for Trump, saying he would be the best outcome for the country.\n\"The economy is not great and it won't be if Harris gets into office,\" Bronson said. \"I believe he will fix it.\"\nAnother Florida voter, Tom Florea, agreed. \"I voted for Trump just because I want to pay less taxes and the biggest tax return I ever got was when he was in office.\"\nOther Trump voters across the country pointed to worries about illegal immigration and post-pandemic migration waves. Trump has promised mass deportations of those illegally in the U.S., especially those with criminal records.\nABORTIONAbortion was front and center for Harris voters and several states had abortion rights measures on the ballot (including Montana, Missouri, Arizona and Florida).\n\"Abortion is the biggest issue. We do need to have a voice on it. Men don't always understand what a woman goes through,\" said Nancy Conter, a retiree from Laurel, Montana.\nTrump carried Montana but an abortion rights measure also passed there.\n\"This is about protecting all the ideals of democracy involving fair elections, women's reproductive rights and not demonizing people,\" said Marc Beaudin, a poet and co-owner of Elk River Books in Livingston, Montana, who voted for Harris and Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester. Tester lost his seat to Trump-backed GOP challenger Tim Sheehy.\nAngela Paniagu, a local house cleaner in Florida who voted for Harris, said abortion rights were also her top priority.\n\"I really wanted to vote on Amendment 4 to help save abortions,\" Paniagu said. \"Women need that.\"\nThe Florida measure — which had big financial backing — failed to get the 60% required for passage, garnering 57%. Trump carried the state over Harris 56% to 43%. President Joe Biden lost to Trump 51% to 48% in 2020.\nThere were also conservative voters who said they turned out to oppose abortion rights measures and liked Trump's promises to show more support for Christians in the U.S. and globally.\n'STOP THE BARBARISM'Other Harris voters were motivated by opposition to Trump and concerns about how he will govern in a second stint as U.S. president.\nRick \"The Catman\" Kingston runs a cat hospice and the Pop Culture Antique Museum in Englewood, Florida.\n\"Without the Constitution, America is nothing,\" Kingston said. \"It's not about party, it's about upholding the Constitution.\"\nKingston also trusts the election system. \"I really do believe in the election process, and I trust it,\" he said. \"The proof is in the pudding.\"\nHe also alluded to Trump.\n\"We had the Bill of Rights and Constitution to stop the barbarism before that,\" he said. \"It's really dangerous to have somebody that does not believe in the Constitution in office.\"\nBut there were voters who noted that Harris was installed at the top of the Democratic ticket in August after Biden was pressured to the quit the race by party chieftains and that the lack of an earlier, competitive primary process might have been a disadvantage.\nIn the other political corner, Olivia Bair, of Chester, Maryland, cast her ballot for Trump, liking his style. \"I want him to win, he does what he says and he listens the best,\" she said.\n'PEOPLE NEED HELP'Voters at an elementary school in the southern part of Maryland knew just how crucial the election was.\n\"Today is very important. Actually it's very emotional because who knows? This is one of the scariest elections I've been a part of and now I'm scared because who knows what's going on in the world?\" said Kenyatta Goodman of Leonardtown, Maryland, who had tears in her eyes.\n\"People need to be there for everyone. Just don't pick out and pinpoint who you're going to help. People have been coming to this country for years, help them. You've been helping them, help them, but those of us who live here need help too,\" she said.\nLaura Wathen was a first-time voter after having been granted American citizenship a few weeks ago. She was focused on local education races.\n\"I feel pretty excited,\" said Wathen, who came to the U.S. from Colombia. As a student at the University of Maryland Global Campus she did research on the local board of education candidates and said that she hopes \"that my decision will hopefully make a change.\"\nAcross the country, Aly Holwege, of Ellensburg, Washington, is an art education major at Central Washington University. She's is also concerned about the future landscape.\n\"I'm worried about rights getting taken away, and about what will become of the education system,\" Holwege said.\nSome voters voiced concerns about the war in the Middle East. Others wanted to hear more specifics from the candidates, including from Harris, beyond her focus on abortion rights and opposing Trump.\n\"My biggest issue is the candidates need to say what they are going to do, instead of just bashing the other person,\" said Britney Landis, a stay-at-home mom from Laurel, Montana. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'I learned to not judge': Veterans Day's origins and contemporary commemorations across the country\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff reports | Section: National \n \n 1571\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The origins of Veterans Day in the U.S. date back to 1921 with the burial of an unknown World War I American soldier on a hillside overlooking the Potomac River in Arlington National Cemetery.Britain and France had already memorialized the end of WWI with burials of unknown soldiers and ceremonies on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, the day the war came to an official close.\nWorld War I — or the Great War — saw more 17 million people killed across Europe.\nIt was violent sea change for Europe and the world.\nIt sparked the Russian Revolution, the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Ottoman Empire and the downfall of monarchies across Europe including those countries and Germany. The age of kings, queens and emperors ruling Europe had come to an end.\nThe U.S. entered the war in 1917.\nThe Spanish Flu pandemic, which killed as many as 50 million people.\nThe war was the development of new and deadlier warfare and its aftermath set the stage for the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazis in Germany and horrors of World War II.\nThe war saw the development of tanks, military aircraft, chemical weapons and flamethrowers and the advent of zippers, sanitary pads and napkins, blood banks and trench coats.\nAn annual commemoration of the formal cease fire was first known as Armistice Day.\nA Congressional resolution in 1926 officially named Armistice Day, and it became a national holiday 12 years later.\nBut according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, in 1947 in Birmingham, Alabama, the first celebration under the name Veterans Day was held with parades and other festivities to honor all veterans.\nCommunities throughout the nation, continue the tradition of holding Veterans Day ceremonies.\nThat includes some events at schools and colleges.\nIn Washington state, Big Lake Elementary School's Veterans Day celebration Thursday included a flag retirement ceremony by members of the Naval Air Station Whidbey Island Search and Rescue unit.\nSHARING EXPERIENCESVeterans enrolled in colleges in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, shared their experiences Thursday at a Veterans Day observance event.\nDuring the event, veterans attending the College of The Albrmarle, Mid-Atlantic Christian University, and Elizabeth City State University talked about their military experiences and how their decision to serve their country had affected their lives and career choices.\nBobby Martin, a student at MACU, joined the U.S. Navy after high school in 1977. His dad, a Vietnam era veteran and minister, was his role model, he said. When his dad's colleagues visited their home to enjoy meals and football games, Martin said he heard first-hand accounts about what it meant to serve in the military.\n\"These men were inspirations to me,\" Martin said. \"I have been to the North Pole, Europe, Middle East and East Africa while in the Navy. I'm 66 years old, put my wife and child through school, and now I'm working on my ministry degree at Mid-Atlantic Christian University. \"\nWendra Costly, a U.S. Army veteran now enrolled at COA, recalled how she left the U.S. Army in 2018 wondering what she would do. While her job in the military was in information technology, and there are promising job opportunities in that field, Costly wasn't persuaded IT would provide her with the long-term career she was seeking.\nAnd as a wife and mother of four, Costly said she knew it was important to have a rewarding career with good pay.\n\"I called the aviation department (at COA) and got some information about their program. I finally decided that aviation was the way to go for (me in) our area,\" she said.\nCostly also talked about some of the challenges veterans face when they go back to school.\n\"We are older, and we have had some experiences that a good amount of college adults will not be able to relate to,\" she said.\nBut overcoming challenges is something you learn to do in the military, Costly said.\n\"Just like all the hard things you accomplished in the military like training, running in the rain, heat and cold — we can do them,\" she said.\nMichelle Barnes, who is enrolled at ECSU, spent eight years working as an aviation electronics technician in the U.S. Navy. Barnes said the fear of traveling to unfamiliar places and the potential of having to face danger nearly delayed her decision to enlist.\nBut she's glad she did enlist. Barnes said her job in the Navy was challenging and provided steady pay.\nToday, she's glad she accepted the challenges the military offered. She met her husband, who is currently enlisted, while she was in service. Serving in the military also has helped her pay for her college expenses.\n\"Joining the military was the best decision that I could have ever made at the age of 25,\" Barnes said. \"I decided to embrace all that the Navy had to offer me in honor of those who fought and died for this country's freedom. \"\nBarnes said she will graduate in 2026 with a bachelor of science degree in aviation science with a concentration in professional aeronautics and a minor in unmanned aerial systems.\nCatherine Edmonds, ECSU's interim chancellor, applauded her colleagues at MACU and COA for helping area veterans return to school to learn new skills. She also thanked the veterans who attended the event.\n\"Although we work every day to assist and honor our veterans, today is set aside specifically to recognize all of our veterans for their service and sacrifices,\" she said. \"We are a military-friendly university, proud to continue a tradition of excellence serving military members, veterans, and their families.\"\nBane Angles, vice president of student services at MACU and also a veteran, said he was impressed by the student veterans' stories. He also was glad, he said, that the city's three institutions of higher education could come together and offer an event like Thursday's.\n\"There are many important lessons I learned from serving in the military,\" Angles said. \"Not least of these is the importance of unity. No matter where a person is from, what accent they have, what race they are, or creed they follow, all are part of something bigger.\n\"In a society that is too divided for many reasons, we can learn from our armed forces that a higher purpose brings us together in unity. I pray for the day when our country is not divided but is united,\" Angles said.\nCOA President Jack Bagwell said the community college was proud to host Thursday's event. He also applauded the veterans in the audience for their service and urged them to help the college serve them better.\n\"We believe we can get better everyday,\" he said. \"With you helping us there are things we have not thought of yet that will serve you better. Please share those. We are always open to your feedback. We're certainly open to how we can be more military friendly.\"\nBAND OF BROTHERSIn Ohio, Athens High School held a special assembly for its students to talk and hear from local veterans.\nMelissa Myers, student council advisor and a French teacher at Athens High, said the event is important.\nMyers recounted when she volunteered at an assisted living home while in high school and formed a bond with a Belgian woman who'd lived through the World Wars and how it changed her perspective.\n\"You can study history and read books and watch movies, but you never truly get an understanding of what people have gone through,\" Myers said. \"It's (about) making those stories come to life and having a better appreciation.\"\nMyers' perspective is also shaped by her father, who served in the Army National Guard.\n\"Hopefully for our high school students it helps our young people understand, no matter what your positions are on various things, everyone who serves, they're serving their country. It's one single vision,\" she said.\nThe main event at the Veterans Day assembly was a speech from Chad Springer, associate superintendent at the local school district and a former U.S. Army sergeant.\nSpringer felt it was important to share his experience with the students, even if he personally prefers to celebrate Veterans Day quietly.\n\"Some veterans like to go to the public events and things like that,\" Springer said. \"Generally, I don't, because service is very personal to me, because all of us had our own reasons for serving.\"\nSpringer told the story of his uncles, Bob and Howard. Howard was a United States Army Ranger during the Second World War, while Bob served in the Army during the Korean War. Bob was able to rise to the rank of sergeant first class in three years, an impressive feat that would've taken years to achieve during peacetime, but he carried the scars of Korea with him for the rest of his life.\n\"Most of the family saw him as a larger than life man with a short fuse, a quick temper and a love of the drink,\" Springer explained.\nSpringer said that serving in the military and experiencing the challenges of military service gave him a different perspective on his Uncle Bob than the rest of his family had and that had he not served, he would've remembered his uncles very differently.\n\"I learned to not judge lest ye be judged, because when it came down to it, we were all needed by each other. I became a brother to those around me,\" Springer said, recounting his time in the Army. \"When someone needed me, their needs were met. When I needed something, others were always there for me. It instilled in myself a sense of community and belonging that I have never felt before nor since.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "World War II veteran looks back on his life\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 401\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Ninety-nine-year-old World War II veteran Reese Hurley doesn't remember a whole lot from his days in the war.\"It's been too long,\" he said on a Tuesday afternoon last month.\nThe Cambridge native remembers having to eat spam — of which he is not fond. \"Spam, oh God!\" he said, remembering his distaste for it. \"Don't want to see it.\"\nHe remembers that he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1942 and served as an aviation electrician. In that role, Hurley was a crew member on \"PBM planes,\" or Martin PBM Mariner planes.\nThe aircraft, designed in 1937, was created by the Martin Company, according to the National Museum of the U.S. Navy. It's initials stand for Patrol Bomber, Martin. According to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, the Martin PBM Mariner is one of the least known patrol aircrafts of World War II, but is considered \"one of the most successful.\"\nThe war is where Hurley learned the trade that would become his career.\n\"That's where I learned,\" he said about becoming an electrician.\nIn his career, Hurley became a chief electrician. He owned a small business in Cambridge at one time.\n\"I was trained in electronics and circuitry,\" he said.\nSometimes, Hurley would get called to factories to help fix machines.\nHurley and his wife, Agnes, had one son, Luther. Agnes has since passed, and Luther lives in North Carolina.\nFor Hurley, the war stories have faded over the years, becoming more distant in his memory. The stories he remembers most are those of his days as a missionary and minister. He said he is most proud of his ministry work.\n\"I was more active probably as a missionary than I was in the Navy,\" Hurley said.\nAlthough Hurley didn't have a close relationship with God when he was in the war, he did later on in life. As a missionary, he traveled more than 33,000 miles, he said. He's been all over the world, including Central America, South America and Asia.\nHurley said he's seen a lot of hunger and suffering.\n\"I've been in three war zones,\" he said. \"They were fighting when I went there, fighting when I left.\"\nHurley said one mission trip he especially enjoyed going on was to India. He recalled a mother coming to him and handing him her unresponsive baby, asking him for help.\nHurley said he took the child, held him up, spoke to God and, lo and behold, the baby started to cry. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There were even some abortion rights ballot measures that passed in states carried by Trump.\nHarris' celebrity backers included Taylor Swift, LeBron James, Beyonce, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Robert De Niro, Jon Bon Jovi, Lady Gaga, James Taylor, Tyler Perry, Oprah Winfrey, Jimmy Kimmel and Bruce Springsteen.\nThe list of celebrities opposing Trump and backing Harris — who was installed at the top of ticket after President Joe Biden was pressured to quit by Democratic donors and power brokers — was lengthy.\nSome Hispanic musicians, rappers and actors were upset with comedian Tony Hinchcliffe calling Puerto Rico \"a floating island of garbage.\"\nMeanwhile, Trump's campaign kept focusing on voters' concerns about inflation — with prices up more than 20% since Harris and Biden took office in 2021.\nFor many voters, Harris and Democrats are viewed as the party of elites. The celebrity endorsements might have fed into that narrative.\nTrump carried majorities of Hispanic men and white women and made gains with first-time voters and Hispanic women.\nTrump ended up carrying Electoral College battlegrounds and won the popular votes. Harris' also lost some voters on either side of the war in the Middle East between Israel and Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah.\nSupporters of Israel don't trust Harris after she snubbed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress in August.\nArab American, Muslim and antiwar voters are upset with Harris and Biden over U.S. military support for Israel and the number of deaths in Gaza in the war that sparked after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attacks.\nTrump did enjoy some celebrity backers including Danica Patrick, Brett Favre, Hulk Hogan, Kid Rock, James Woods, Joe Rogan, Dana White and 'Dr. Phil' McGraw. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "U.S. to keep up war aid to Israel after pre-election concern over Gaza: U.S. has approved $17.9B for Israel during Oct. 7 war\n\n November 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: World \n \n 1270\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. won't curtail military shipments to Israel after the Biden-Harris administration said before the presidential election it could curb weapons aid over dire conditions in the Gaza war zone.The election is over with now President-elect Donald Trump defeating Vice President Kamala Harris.\nIn October, the Biden-Harris administration cited a federal law related to restrictions on military aid to countries that block U.S. humanitarian aid. Israel was given 30 days to improve the humanitarian and relief situation in Gaza or potentially see weapons and munition aid restricted under the U.S. law.\nThe U.S. State Department said Tuesday (a week after the election) the U.S. would not be cutting off military aid to Israel after the administration sent the Israeli government a notice before the election that the humanitarian situation needed to improve.\nThe U.S. has spent $22.8 billion supporting Israel in the war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon after the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks, according to Brown University.\nThat includes $17.9 billion in weapons aid to Israel approved by Congress and the Biden-Harris administration since the start of the war. The U.S. typically allocates Israel $3.8 billion in military aid annually.\nHamas and Hezbollah are both Islamist Iranian proxies.\nThe Biden-Harris administration had considered — but is now opting against — restricting U.S. military aid to Israel over dire humanitarian situations and civilian deaths in Gaza in the continued Middle East War.\n\"The intent was to inject a sense of urgency with Israel to take necessary steps to address the dire humanitarian situation of children, women, and men in Gaza. The effect has been that of the 15 steps that we urged action on, Israel has taken action either in implementing or being in the process of implementing 12 of the 15 steps,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in remarks to reporters Wednesday.\nBlinken said the U.S. wants to see more prolonged pauses in fighting to allow for more aid to get in and that Israel still needs to go better in notifying Palestinian civilians regarding the issuing and lifting of evacuation orders. The U.S. also wants to see more commercial trucks allowed in and out of Gaza to bring in aid and supplies.\n\"The challenge there in terms of restoring commercial trucking has been a huge problem of lawlessness and looting inside of Gaza that needs to be addressed and that we're working on finding a solution to,\" Blinken continued.\nThe move came before the 2024 election in which Harris faced criticism from anti-war voters (including Muslims and Arab-Americans) opposed to U.S. military support for Israel.\nMore than 43,700 Palestinians have died in the war in Gaza, according to numbers cited by the United Nations and Palestinian groups. Those numbers include civilians and Hamas and other Islamist fighters. There are dire conditions in Gaza for Palestinian civilians.\nIsrael Defense Forces contend Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon purposely embed their fighters and weapons with civilians and civilian assets.\nThere have been more than 1,800 Israeli deaths in the war including those killed on Oct. 7, 2023 and IDF soldiers killed in combat. Approximately 100 Israeli hostages (a handful of them with dual American citizenship) are still be held by Hamas in Gaza.\nThe U.S. administration has failed to get a ceasefire in the Israel war with the Iranian proxies.\nSome voters and interests who support Israel were also distrustful that Harris would keep with the pro-Israel policies of President Joe Biden and previous administrations.\nExit polls from the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) found Harris finished third in the presidential race, nationally, behind the Green Party's Jill Stein (53%) and Trump (who promised to end the Middle East War) (21%). Stein opposes U.S. support for Israel and the war in Gaza.\nHarris got 21% of the Muslim vote nationally. There are close to 4.5 million Muslims in the U.S.\nIn Michigan, Stein received 59% of the Muslim vote versus 22% for Trump and 14% for Harris, according to CAIR.\nTrump carried the key Electoral College battleground over Harris by 80,600 votes He won Dearborn and Dearborn Heights —which have the country's highest percentage of Arab-American population — after those jurisdictions went for Biden in 2020.\nHarris was installed by party leaders at the top of Democratic ticket after they pressured Biden, 81, to quit over age concerns. Biden got 8 million more votes nationally in 2020 than Harris did in 2024. That's a 10% difference.\nRoughly two-thirds of Arab Americans are Christians, according to the Arab American Institute. Trump reached out Christians and Muslims in Michigan promising to end the war.\nIn Michigan, Harris got 80,000 fewer votes in 2024 than Biden did in 2020.\n\"Our final exit poll of American Muslim voters confirms that opposition to the Biden administration's support for the war on Gaza played a crucial role, leading to a sharp drop in support for Vice President Harris compared to the support President Biden received from Muslim voters in 2020, and a sharp rise in support for third party candidate Jill Stein. President-Elect Trump also managed to make in-roads with Muslim voters,\" said CAIR National Government Affairs Director Robert McCaw.\nThe Arab American Institute, American Friends Service Committee (the Quakers), Global Ministries (United Church of Christ and Disciples of Christ) and Progressive Democrats of America continue to push Congress to impose an arms embargo on Israel over the Gaza war.\nIn the other corner the American Israel Political Action Committee (AIPAC and Christians United for Israel — two of the top pro-Israel groups — oppose an arms embargo against Israel pushes from the left. They also welcomed U.S. Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, being elected Senate Majority Leader Wednesday citing his pro-Israel record.\nTrump won two counties — Passaic County, New Jersey and Rockland County, New York— with high percentages of more conservative Jewish voters that were carried by Biden in 2020.\nA pre-election poll by the Manhattan Institute found Harris leading Trump among Jewish voters by a 67% to 31% margin.\nBiden carried 68% of the 2020 presidential vote compared to 30% for Trump, according to the Jewish Virtual Library.\nExit polls from Edison Research showed Jewish voters in 10 key states voted for Harris by a 79% to 21% margin over Trump.\nThat is in contrast to a pre-election poll in Israel showing 66% of Israelis backed Trump versus 17% for Harris.\nThere are close to 7.5 million Jews in the U.S. They make up 2.2% of the U.S. population and 44.5% of the world's Jewish population, according to the Jewish Virtual Library.\nThere are more Jewish people living in the U.S. than Israel (7.4 million people, accounting for 44.3% of the world's Jewish population, according to JVL.\nTrump announced Tuesday to appointment of Mike Huckabee — an Evangelical leader and pro-Israel advocate who was the former governor of Arkansas — as his pick for the ambassador to Israel.\n\"He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!,\" Trump said of Huckabee.\nTrump continues to name appointees and met with Biden at the White House Wednesday\nEvangelical Christians are among some of the most ardent supporters of Israel.\nCUFI supports Huckabee's appointment.\n\"There is no better person to represent the American people in Jerusalem at this time. Governor Mike Huckabee believes in Israel's right to self-determination and defense, not because it is politically convenient to do so but because these are immutable tenets of his core beliefs. Whether serving his congregation as a Pastor or his constituents as Governor, Huckabee has both the heart and mind for this Ambassadorship, and we know he will work tirelessly to ensure the relationship between America and Israel remains stronger than ever,\" said CUFI Action Fund Chairwoman Sandra Parker. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Voter turnout: 13M more nonvoters than Trump backers; Harris got 10% fewer votes than Biden\n\n November 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: News \n \n 1205\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n More than 89 million voting eligible Americans didn't vote in the 2024 elections, according to the latest tallies collected by the University of Florida's Election Lab.That accounts for more than 36.4% of the U.S. total electorate of 244.7 million people (voters and nonvoters).\nThere are still some votes being counted in California and Arizona.\nBut as it stands as of Thursday, Nov. 14, there were 13.2 million more nonvoters than supporters of now President-elect Donald Trump in the 2024 White House race.\nTrump — who defeated Vice President Kamala Harris — has received close to 75.9 million votes, according to tallies Thursday from The Associated Press.\nThat accounts for just over 50% of the popular vote. But if nonvoters are included Trump got 31% of the electorate (voting and nonvoting).\nHarris, the sitting U.S. vice president, has received close to 72.9 million votes, as of Thursday's counts.\nThat is more than 16.2 million fewer votes than the number of non-voters. As it stands, Harris got 29.7% of the total U.S. electorate.\nHarris was installed at the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden was pressured by Democratic Party leaders and donors to quit the race in late July over concerns about his advanced age. There were some polls showing U.S. voters viewing that installation as 'undemocratic.'\nBiden got close to 81.3 million in 2020 when he defeated Trump. That is more than 8.3 million more votes than Harris got in 2024. There were also more than 4.1 million fewer voters overall in 2024 compared to 2020.\nAni Ruhil, associate dean for research and planning and professor at Ohio University's Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Service, said ongoing vote counts could impact final turnout figures.\nBut Ruhil sees lower turnout as a key trend line in the 2024 race that saw Trump return to the White House.\n\"Only seven states exceeded their 2020 turnout rate — Georgia, Michigan, North Dakota, Vermont and Wisconsin,\" Ruhil said. \"Washington, D.C., had an especially poor showing compared to 2020. So did Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Alaska, Illinois, and Utah.\"\nThe number of voters casting ballots in 2024 was down 11.6% in New Jersey, 11.2% in Illinois, 8.9% in Oregon and 4.6% in Washington state compared to 2020.\nNationally, turnout stands at 63.6%, according to the University of Florida. Ruhil said turnout in 2020 — which totaled 66.6% nationally — was a political aberration.\nThe Biden-Trump 2020 race occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw more than 1.1 million deaths in the U.S., millions of workers facing job cuts and reduced hours, mask mandates and closures of schools, business and social events.\n\"Turnout was fanned by fear and anger,\" he said.\n\"In comes President Biden, with the singular charge of steering the country through the pandemic, and of making sure the economy did not fall to pieces. But by 2023, as we came out of the pandemic, inflation had taken its toll. Now was not the fear of a virus, but rather of gaping holes in the pocketbook. But there was no comforting plan being put forth by the White House,\" Ruhil continued.\nHe sees some voter fatigue with continued efforts by federal and state prosecutors to go after Trump.\nSeventy percent of voters said the U.S. is headed in the wrong direction, with two-thirds stressed about inflation and the economy. Prices are up more than 20% since the pandemic and from when Biden and Harris took office in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nVoters worried about the economy and high prices favored Trump in the 2024 race, according to exit polls.\nThe war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks also challenged Harris.\nAnti-war voters (including Muslims and Arab Americans) are upset with U.S. military support for Israel. In the other corner, supporters of Israel (including more conservative Jewish voters) didn't trust Harris to continue U.S. support for Israel . The U.S. has allocated $17.9 billion war aid to Israel since Hamas's 2023 attacks, according to Brown University.\nHarris got just over 80,000 fewer votes in Michigan, where the Israel-Hamas war is an issue for Arab-American and Muslim voters, than Biden 2020.\nShe lost to Trump by just over 80,600 votes in Michigan.\nRuhil said the enthusiasm was let out of the turnout balloon for many Democratic voters.\n\"The late switch, fevered fundraising, and a hastily assembled campaign did nothing to instill confidence,\" he said, stressing the lack of a convincing economic message from Harris.\nHarris' campaign raised more than $1 billion and had another $649 million in backing from outside groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Trump raised $381.5 million and was aided by $711 million in outside spending, according to CRP.\nHarris' campaign focused heavily on support for abortion rights, casting Trump as a fascist threat to democracy and procuring celebrity endorsements including Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, Willie Nelson and Bruce Springsteen.\nThe effort fell short with Harris underperforming Biden by 8.4 million votes (or 10.3%) nationally. She saw lower turnout or flat support levels in key Electoral College battlegrounds that Trump won.\nHarris got 6.6% fewer votes than Biden in Arizona.\nThere was also the dynamic of Trump carrying states such as Montana, Missouri, Arizona and Florida, where there were abortion rights measures also on the ballot.\nThose measures all passed and in Florida an abortion rights measure got 57% of the vote (failing to meet the state's 60% threshold). Trump got 56% of the vote.\nIn Montana, Trump carried the state with 58%. An abortion rights measure got the same percentage.\nTrump favors allowing states to decide the abortion issue versus Harris, who backs nationally enshrining abortion rights.\nAbortion rights groups were among the top backers of Harris.\n\"This result is devastating. There has been no greater champion for reproductive freedom than Vice President Kamala Harris,\" said Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, a leading abortion rights advocacy group.\n\"We know the American people are with us, and they showed us that when they passed ballot measures and elected candidates in key states to protect their rights, said Timmaraju, who worries about Trump and the GOP in charge of the White House and Congress.\nHarris and Democrats had hoped for a wave of women voters supporting abortion rights in the race against Trump.\nBut exit polls showed Trump carrying a majority of white women who voted, and voters were more evenly split on which presidential candidate they trusted on the abortion issue than in pre-election polls.\nAbortion rights opponents argue Harris' focus on expansive abortion rights turned off some voters.\n\"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz support abortion anytime, anywhere, and under any circumstances. Supported by the abortion industry and its allies, Harris and Walz campaigned with fanatical fervor on abortion — and the voters rejected them,\" said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life.\nTrump carried 58% of the Catholic vote versus 40% for Harris, according to NBC News exit polls. In 2020, Biden and Trump were evenly split with Catholics (49% to 50%), according to the Associated Press.\nTrump won 63% of the votes from white working class women, made inroads with Hispanics (especially Hispanic men) and edged Harris with working class households, according to NBC News exit polls.\nAccording to the University of Florida, there were 15.5 million fewer early votes in 2024 compared to 2020 (85.9 million versus 101.45 million).\nThat's a 15% drop. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lessons learned in the presidential election\n\n November 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 775\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Even before he is sworn into office in January, Donald Trump has firmly secured a prominent place in American history books.He is only the second president in U.S. history elected to two nonconsecutive terms.\nThe road to that Outcome was a long and winding one.\nIt was a road where Trump repeatedly challenged conventional wisdom and proved it to be wrong at every step of the way.\nBelow is a recap of conventional wisdom from the 2024 presidential election with conventional wisdom being defined as a widely accepted assumption and prediction.\nBelow each conventional wisdom is a recap of actual Outcomes relative to conventional wisdom.\nConvential Wisdom: Donald Trump was finished in politics due to being impeached twice in the U.S. House of Representatives during his first presidential term, federal criminal indictments (still pending), and state felony convictions (still being appealed).\nOutcome: With a combination of resilience, determination and perseverance, Trump triumphed over 15 Republicans for the Republican Party's 2024 presidential nomination.\nConvential Wisdom: In a June debate between Biden and Trump, both would deliver solid performances.\nOutcome: Biden's debate performance was arguably the worst in history.\nConvential Wisdom: Despite his debate performance, Biden would stay in a reelection grudge match with Trump.\nOutcome: In July, Biden abruptly withdrew his bid for reelection and immediately endorsed Kamala Harris, a move that led to her being the Democratic Party's standard bearer.\nConvential Wisdom: Harris would not do well in her only debate with Trump.\nOutcome: Harris exceeded expectations which gave her campaign a much-needed boost.\nConvential Wisdom: There would be at least one \"October surprise\" from the Biden administration.\nOutcome: An \"October surprise\" came early but not from the Biden administration. It came in July when Trump narrowly escaped death from an assassination attempt.\nConvential Wisdom: Harris could mobilize support from women voters with two campaign messages. One was a message used very effectively by Democratic candidates in the 2022 midterm elections — vote against Republicans as they are not pro-choice on abortion. The second message was now women voters had another opportunity to elect a woman as president of the United States.\nOutcome: More women than the Harris campaign expected concluded that the state of the economy and high levels of inflation were their top concerns. Concurrently, they also concluded that despite electing a woman for president of the United States was a long-awaited opportunity, Kamala Harris was not that woman.\nConvential Wisdom: Trump would experience the same lack of support from working class voters, urban voters, Black voters, young voters, Asian voters and Jewish voters that Republican presidential candidates have historically experienced.\nOutcome: Trump's support from all these groups exceeded all expectations. He won the \"blue wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin as well as four other \"swing states.\"\nConvential Wisdom: Despite being fiercely loyal to President Biden and all of his progressive policies for almost four years, Kamala Harris could tell voters she would be a very different president than Biden.\nOutcome: Voters rejected that messaging after Harris answered a question on what she would do differently from President Biden with: \"Nothing that I can think of.\" U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders also cast aspersions on her integrity when he said publicly Harris was a progressive who would say whatever she needed to say to get elected.\nConvential Wisdom: Kamala Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, could help offset Trump campaign messages that Harris has been and is a radical San Francisco California progressive. Walz could be branded as a quintessential American \"everyman\" — a former high school teacher, former high school football coach, military veteran, former member of Congress and now governor of Minnesota.\nOutcome: Walz was quickly and negatively viewed by voters as not ready for prime time due to frequent verbal gaffes and his answers (misleading at best) to questions about his background, especially his military service record.\nConvential Wisdom: The November election popular vote outcome was expected to be a tossup that could result in a narrow popular vote win for either candidate.\nOutcome: Trump won with 50.38% of the popular vote compared to 47.96% of the popular vote for Harris.\nConvential Wisdom: The November election Electoral College vote outcome was expected to be a tossup that could result in a narrow Electoral College win for either candidate.\nOutcome: With 270 Electoral College votes needed to win, Trump received 312 Electoral College votes compared to Harris' 226 Electoral College votes. Trump was the first Republican president elected since 2004 to win both the popular vote and the Electoral College vote.\nGoing forward, the 2024 presidential election confirmed two absolute truths about conventional wisdom for political candidates, campaigns, pundits, voters and others.\nNever assume anything will happen at any until the polls close on Election Day.\nAnything may happen at any time until the polls close on Election Day. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-11-16",
    "author": "Staff Writer",
    "content": "What lessons did we learn from the election?\n\n November 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Columns \n \n 669\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n What did we learn from the majority of America's voters on Nov. 5?We learned that the majority of America's voters want border security. Americans are tired of millions of undocumented people from any place in the world flooding into America. We want them to come legally. The reports of gangs growing in our cities, apartment buildings taken over, murders and rampant stabbings have been an emotional weight from which Americans want relief.\nAmericans are tired of spending more money at the grocery store and coming home with fewer products. Every week brings price increases, and Americans pay checks are not keeping up. Employers have been suffering to keep employees who are desperate for higher wages.\nEmployers can no longer get by with $10 or $12 an hour as the new expected minimum wage has become at least $15. To keep a good employee though will take $20 an hour if you want them to stay. This has put a strain on small businesses in America who are struggling to produce enough income to pay workers and keep the lights on. The cost of goods must decrease and wages have to stabilize.\nAmericans want lower interest rates. A 6% house loan is still making in tough on America's homebuyers. A 30-year mortgage on a $450,000 house is $2,158.38 if you have $90,000 to put down. A six-year car payment on a $45,000 car is $596.62 if you put $9,000 down. Most Americans need a house and car. So you see the reason why people are desperate to make more money. Add on to this a $1,200 a month grocery bill for a family of four.\nAmericans have grown weary hearing about male athletes in women's sports. We are also tired of hearing about men in women's bathrooms.\nAmericans also displayed their disdain for legacy media. I personally thought it would be tough for Trump to overcome all the major networks. I didn't see how anyone could beat NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN and MSNBC, the New York Times, The Washington Post and almost every other major media entity in the nation, but he did. He beat them good.\nOne network supported Trump throughout the entire election, and it was Fox News. On election night they had the highest ratings of all the networks. The majority of America's voters no longer believe much of what they hear on America's major media networks, which is sad since we all pay so much in subscriptions to access these stations.\nTrump spent three hours with Joe Rogan on a podcast that reached millions of Rogan's viewers. Harris didn't have time for Rogan. Look for many more podcasters to grow in influence in the days ahead.\nWe learned that women did go to polls to vote, and many of them voted for Trump.\nKamala Harris had over $1 billion to spend on her election The networks were flooded with political ads, and it still wasn't enough. Sadly, it's reported that her campaign is $20 million in debt with no way in sight to cover outstanding costs. The big parties and celebrity gatherings were massively expensive. No cost was curbed. A billion dollars was spent without concern or limitation. Can you imagine how she would have handled the nation's finances and run our country?\nWe also learned that national celebrities don't impress America's voters all that much. They will pay thousands to hear Taylor Swift sing, but her support of Kamala Harris was overall ignored. Many of Swift's followers aren't old enough to vote. Oprah Winfrey, Beyonce, George Clooney, Bruce Springsteen, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Julia Roberts, etc., etc. are all-star entertainers, but the average person in America just wasn't swayed by them when it came time to vote.\nThe election is over. Let's pray that Congress will work together to end the wars in the world, lower inflation, make medical care available for all people on all levels of their need. Let's pray for a safe and peaceful America where people are entering our country legally and safely and for four years of prosperity and peace. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Voter turnout: 13M more nonvoters than Trump backers; Harris got 10% fewer votes than Biden;\n\n November 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: News \n \n 1204\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n More than 89 million voting eligible Americans didn't vote in the 2024 elections, according to the latest tallies collected by the University of Florida's Election Lab.That accounts for more than 36.4% of the U.S. total electorate of 244.7 million people (voters and nonvoters).\nThere are still some votes being counted in California and Arizona.\nBut as it stands as of Thursday, Nov. 14, there were 13.2 million more nonvoters than supporters of now President-elect Donald Trump in the 2024 White House race.\nTrump — who defeated Vice President Kamala Harris — has received close to 75.9 million votes, according to tallies Thursday from The Associated Press.\nThat accounts for just over 50% of the popular vote. But if nonvoters are included Trump got 31% of the electorate (voting and nonvoting).\nHarris, the sitting U.S. vice president, has received close to 72.9 million votes, as of Thursday's counts.\nThat is more than 16.2 million fewer votes than the number of non-voters. As it stands, Harris got 29.7% of the total U.S. electorate.\nHarris was installed at the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden was pressured by Democratic Party leaders and donors to quit the race in late July over concerns about his advanced age. There were some polls showing U.S. voters viewing that installation as 'undemocratic.'\nBiden got close to 81.3 million in 2020 when he defeated Trump. That is more than 8.3 million more votes than Harris got in 2024. There were also more than 4.1 million fewer voters overall in 2024 compared to 2020.\nAni Ruhil, associate dean for research and planning and professor at Ohio University's Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Service, said ongoing vote counts could impact final turnout figures.\nBut Ruhil sees lower turnout as a key trend line in the 2024 race that saw Trump return to the White House.\n\"Only seven states exceeded their 2020 turnout rate – Georgia, Michigan, North Dakota, Vermont and Wisconsin,\" Ruhil said. \"Washington, D.C., had an especially poor showing compared to 2020. So did Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Alaska, Illinois, and Utah.\"\nThe number of voters casting ballots in 2024 was down 11.6% in New Jersey, 11.2% in Illinois, 8.9% in Oregon and 4.6% in Washington state compared to 2020.\nNationally, turnout stands at 63.6%, according to the University of Florida. Ruhil said turnout in 2020 — which totaled 66.6% nationally — was a political aberration.\nThe Biden-Trump 2020 race occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw more than 1.1 million deaths in the U.S., millions of workers facing job cuts and reduced hours, mask mandates and closures of schools, business and social events.\n\"Turnout was fanned by fear and anger,\" he said.\n\"In comes President Biden, with the singular charge of steering the country through the pandemic, and of making sure the economy did not fall to pieces. But by 2023, as we came out of the pandemic, inflation had taken its toll. Now was not the fear of a virus, but rather of gaping holes in the pocketbook. But there was no comforting plan being put forth by the White House,\" Ruhil continued.\nHe sees some voter fatigue with continued efforts by federal and state prosecutors to go after Trump.\nSeventy percent of voters said the U.S. is headed in the wrong direction, with two-thirds stressed about inflation and the economy. Prices are up more than 20% since the pandemic and from when Biden and Harris took office in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nVoters worried about the economy and high prices favored Trump in the 2024 race, according to exit polls.\nThe war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks also challenged Harris.\nAnti-war voters (including Muslims and Arab Americans) are upset with U.S. military support for Israel. In the other corner, supporters of Israel (including more conservative Jewish voters) didn't trust Harris to continue U.S. support for Israel. The U.S. has allocated $17.9 billion war aid to Israel since Hamas' 2023 attacks, according to Brown University.\nHarris got just over 80,000 fewer votes in Michigan, where the Israel-Hamas war is an issue for Arab-American and Muslim voters, than Biden 2020.\nShe lost to Trump by just over 80,600 votes in Michigan.\nRuhil said the enthusiasm was let out of the turnout balloon for many Democratic voters.\n\"The late switch, fevered fundraising, and a hastily assembled campaign did nothing to instill confidence,\" he said, stressing the lack of a convincing economic message from Harris.\nHarris' campaign raised more than $1 billion and had another $649 million in backing from outside groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

World history provides examples of national leaders who appointed outrageous and patently unqualified nominees to important positions of power, as a deliberate strategy to aggregate and demonstrate their own power.If this is Trump's objective, the question is, can he carry it off?\nThe Roman emperor Caligula (37-41 AD) sought to diminish respect for the Roman Senate and its administrative authority, thereby enhancing the emperor's power. He reportedly planned to name his favorite horse, Incitatus, as a consul to preside over the Senate and serve as the chief magistrate of the state. This would humiliate the Roman Senate and imply that their role was merely ceremonial. In the past week, the horse was Matt Gaetz.\nTrump's nomination of Matt Gaetz for attorney general was a means of demonstrating Trump's raw political power. The more outrageous the candidate, the greater the demonstration of Trump's absolute control, if Congress acceded. (It would also fulfill his campaign to disrupt the \"deep state.\" Trump's recent nominees are the epitome of disruption.)\nThe problem was not Gaetz's positions on policy, which we can only infer, but the absurdity of even imagining Gaetz as attorney general because of his lack of experience, expertise and his questionable character. Republican senators were expected to abandon their Constitutional role of advice and consent, fall in line with Trump's wishes, and vote for the nominee, or face future primary challengers.\nSuffering another dishonor, senators would have had to vote blindly to confirm Gaetz because Trump seems unwilling to subject his nominees to the normal vetting process. In the House, the speaker chose to protect Trump's nominee by quashing publication of a House Ethics Committee report on Gaetz's sexual transgressions with minors.\nIf the Senate had voted to confirm Gaetz under these circumstances, then the Senate's Constitutional role of advice and consent is a rubber stamp. This would humiliate Congress and transfer perceived power from them to the White House.\nSecond, Gaetz' nomination, if he were confirmed, would have belittled and diminished the Justice Department as an institution in the eyes of the public. If stooges run the Justice Department, then obviously the Justice Department has lost its cherished independence, and the real locus of power is the White House. (The first objective of autocrats is to create chaos and seize the wheels of justice.) On Thursday, enough senators had indicated displeasure with Trump's nominee that Gaetz withdrew.\nHowever, there are other horses in Trump's stable, such as Tulsi Gabbard, who is nominated to lead all our intelligence services. She is not just unqualified, but antagonistic to our national interests. Moscow must have broken out the vodka after her nomination. She has no relevant experience in intelligence and even parrots Putin's talking points. This makes her nomination especially odious, which, of course, serves Trump's purposes of demonstrating his power, undermining respect for our intelligence services, which he detests and weakening their ability to contradict the president.\nThere are other equine-like nominees such as Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense and Robert Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services. They all have in common no apparent experience or qualifications for the job, serious questions about their fitness for the office, absolute fealty to Trump, and nomination to agencies about which Trump is contemptuous.\nThe coming power struggle between Congress and Trump over nominees will provide an initial indication of whether Congress will stand up to Trump and protect their Constitutional authorities, if Trump clearly overreaches and unwisely flaunts his new political power.\nIf Congress cannot protect its Constitutional prerogatives, then there is another example from history to consider. French King Louis XIV, intentionally appointed sycophants, and weak, incompetent or corrupt persons to high office to undermine powerful institutions in France and to centralize power in himself. In the end, attributed to the French King was his famous claim, \"L'etat, c'est moi! — \"the state, it is me!\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Protecting kids online or social media censorship?: The year-end push for and against the Kids Online Safety Act\n\n November 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: News \n \n 934\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Attorneys general from 30 states (and from both political parties) are pressing Congress to pass a measure aimed at protecting kids from harmful content online.But free speech advocates worry the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) will lead to censorship, including restricting controversial and unpopular speech that should enjoy First Amendment protections.\nOn Nov. 18, the 30 attorneys general — including Republicans Austin Knudsen of Montana, Ashley Moody of Florida, Sean Reyes of Utah and Bridget Hill of Wyoming, and Democrats Letitia James of New York, Anthony Brown of Maryland, Kathleen Jennings of Delaware and Keith Ellison of Minnesota — wrote congressional leaders advocating for KOSA's full passage before the end of the year.\nThe bill passed the U.S. Senate in July but has faced some roadblocks in the U.S. House of Representatives. Congress is currently in a lame-duck period after the Nov. 5 election but before President-elect Donald Trump and a new GOP-controlled Congress take office.\nThe latest version of the bill requires social media and online companies to install \"mandatory default safety settings\" related to minors under the age of 16, and requires social media and online platforms to restrict sexual content aimed at minors, online bullying, and content that promotes self harm, illegal drug use or substance abuse.\nThe measure also looks to further restrict sexual predators and sex traffickers online.\n\"Many social media platforms target minors, resulting in a national youth mental health catastrophe. These platforms make their products addictive to minor users, and then profit from selling minor user data to advertisers. These platforms fail to disclose the addicting nature of their products, nor the harms associated with increased social media use. Instead, minor users receive endless tailored and toxic content,\" the attorneys general wrote in their letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other congressional leaders.\nThey want KOSA passed and approved by President Joe Biden before the end of the year and before a new Congress and Trump take office in January and the legislative process starts over.\nAn amended bill before the House better partners with state-level social media pushes, the attorneys general contend, allows users to disable or block some social media content and looks to restrict online content that is detrimental to kids' mental health.\nBut the latter aim and some of KOSA's other provisions worry free speech advocates. They say the bill — with its laudable title — could be used to censor content that should be protected by First Amendment free speech guarantees.\nGreg Gonzalez, legislative counsel for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), said the federal bill \"presents some very serious free speech and First Amendment concerns.\"\nFIRE and other free speech groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, oppose the bill and argue it will step on kids' First Amendment rights.\n\"Even if it is speech people don't like, it's speech that deserves First Amendment protections,\" Gonzalez said.\nGonzalez sees scenarios where social media platforms will use KOSA to restrict content that is unpopular or controversial under the guise of protecting children and teens and their mental health.\n\"At some point, platforms are going to be overly inclusive,\" he said of the content that could be restricted.\nLarge social media and online companies restricted, blocked and prohibited some users and content that challenged the results of the 2020 U.S. elections and questioned COVID-19 vaccines. Other groups and users with controversial or extreme political or social views have also been banned by social media sites and de-platformed by online companies.\nSome technology companies, including Microsoft, as well as the American Federation of Teachers and parents' groups such as Common Sense Media, back KOSA.\nOther tech groups oppose the federal measure. The Electronic Freedom Foundation said the House version of KOSA \"is still a dangerous online censorship bill\" that \"will coerce the largest social media platforms into blocking or filtering a variety of entirely legal content, and subject a large portion of users to privacy-invasive age verification.\"\nGonzalez also sees age verification efforts — which several states, including Montana, have imposed on pornography sites — raising privacy concerns for minors and adults.\nFIRE also does not like the Federal Trade Commission's potential role in KOSA's implementation.\nGonzalez said he hopes the clock runs out on the measure at the end of the year, and free speech groups promise to challenge KOSA in court if it becomes law.\nThe measure passed the Senate by a 91-3 margin, with support from both sides of the partisan aisle.\n\"Children and teens have been subjected to online harassment, bullying, and other harms for far too long. The Kids Online Safety Act will require social media companies to design their products with the safety of kids and teens in mind, provide parents tools to protect their kids, and give families more options for managing and disconnecting from these platforms,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who backed the bill along with conservative Republicans such as Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee (a top sponsor of the bill along with U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.), Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Steve Daines of Montana.\nU.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., voted against the bill, along with conservative Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky.\nWyden said earlier this year he worries about KOSA eroding online privacy for kids and teens, and an incoming Trump administration using the law to censor political and social voices it does not like.\n\"I fear KOSA could be used to sue services that offer privacy technologies like encryption or anonymity features that kids rely on to communicate securely and privately without being spied on by predators online,\" said Wyden, explaining his opposition in a social media statement earlier this year. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-11-30",
    "author": "DAVID REEL",
    "content": "Race was model for civil discourse in politics\n\n November 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 741\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I, along with countless others, closely followed a recent U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania.The stakes in this election were extremely high. The outcome was expected to help decide if Republican senators or Democratic senators would have a majority in and control of the Senate for at least the next two years.\nIn this election, voters had a clear choice between two candidates with sharply differing views on President Biden's performance record over the past four years.\nBoth candidates raised and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising to share their differing views with voters. As a result, voters had numerous opportunities to reach informed decisions on which candidate's views resonated best with their own views.\nPrior to the election, conventional wisdom was incumbent Democratic Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. would win reelection.\nSenator Casey's father, Robert P. Casey Sr., was a popular and still widely revered former governor of Pennsylvania. Casey Jr. was elected to the U.S. Senate three times after being elected once for state treasurer and twice for state auditor general.\nConsistent with many other expected election outcomes this year, conventional wisdom proved to be wrong.\nIt was wrong, in part because Donald Trump's better than expected support in Pennsylvania generated votes (aka coattails) that helped Dave McCormick, Casey's Republican opponent. At the same time, Kamala Harris' lower than expected support in Pennsylvania did not generate enough votes (aka coattails) to help Casey.\nIn any event, the outcome of the election was incredibly close.\nBefore the results were certified, McCormick had 48.8 % of the vote and Casey had 48.6% of the vote. The close results triggered a state law mandating an automatic government-funded recount since the margin of difference was less than 0.5%. The law allows the projected \"losing\" candidate to decline a recount. Not surprisingly, Casey chose not to do so.\nWhile the recount was underway lawyers for both campaigns engaged in aggressive attempts to seek a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling to determine if state law allowed incorrectly dated, undated, incorrectly signed, or unsigned provisional ballots to be counted.\nA majority of the seven-member court ruled in a 4-3 vote that state law was clear that these provisional ballots could not be counted. This majority opinion included two Democratic justices voting no and two Republican justices voting no.\nFollowing the Supreme Court ruling but before a recount was finished, Casey conceded.\nIn his concession speech, Casey thanked the people of Pennsylvania for the privilege of serving them and for placing their trust in him. He said it has been the honor of his lifetime.\nIn his speech, Casey never expressed bitterness or anger over the election outcome, nor did he assign blame for his loss. He did not complain about an aggressive and ultimately successful effort by attorneys with the McCormick campaign to secure the court ruling prohibiting the counting of certain provisional ballots. Casey noted that he followed a long-standing protocol in politics by calling McCormick to congratulate him on his win.\nIn response to Casey's concession call, McCormick released a statement that included the following — \"Senator Bob Casey dedicated his career to bettering our Commonwealth. Dina and I want to extend our sincere gratitude to Senator Casey, Teresa, and their family for their decades of service, hard work, and sacrifice.\"\nIn McCormick's statement, there was no gloating or disparaging remarks about his opponent. He did not complain about an aggressive, extended and ultimately unsuccessful effort by attorneys with the Casey campaign to secure a court ruling allowing the counting of certain provisional ballots.\nSome may say both candidates' post-election remarks were carefully scripted by campaign staff and were insincere at best and at worse masked the candidate's true feelings.\nMaybe so, but I disagree. I believe both candidates' remarks were sincere and from the heart.\nTheir remarks reflected the character of two opposing candidates who ran issue-based campaigns, focused on telling voters about significant differences of their positions on critical issues of the day.\nWhen the election results were finally confirmed almost two weeks after Election Day, both candidates accepted a court ruling (the rule of law), accepted the election results and displayed respect for each other.\nI suggest their actions reflect a small, but long overdue missing commitment to civil discourse in today's contentious and increasingly polarized world.\nThe actions of soon-to-be former Sen. Casey and now Sen.-elect McCormick are a model for civil discourse in the political arena.\nGoing forward, that model should be embraced by every candidate and the supporters of every candidate in every election at every level in America. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "The 2024 election was no Republican landslide\n\n November 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 542\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The election was no landslide and certainly no mandate for Donald F. Trump to create the total upheaval of the government represented by the president-elect's choices for his cabinet.A landslide was when Lyndon B. Johnson won by 16 million votes in 1964, while Donald Trump won by 2.5 million votes in 2024. For Lyndon B. Johnson it represented more than 60% of the popular vote. For Donald F. Trump it represents 50% of the popular vote while Kamala Harris won 48.4%. (A few races are being recounted, as is required if they are very close, so these numbers are not final.)\nFive presidents from the out-of-power party have won with a larger share of the popular vote than Donald Trump did. They are Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Ronald Reagan in 1980, Barack Obama in 2008 and Biden in 2020.\nLyndon Johnson is not listed here, as his party was in power when he was reelected in 1964 as mentioned above.\nTrump's win at the top of the ticket did not help down-ballot candidates much in some swing states and elsewhere. In Arizona, Democrat Rep. Ruben Gallego was elected to the Senate; in Michigan, Democrat Rep. Elissa Slotkin was elected to the Senate. In Nevada, incumbent Sen. Jacky Rosen was reelected. In Wisconsin incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin was reelected.\nThe Republicans won the Senate by three seats. The Republicans won the House narrowly by 220 seats versus 215 for the Democrats. This may not be the final tally as Trump may choose more congressmen or women for his cabinet and all races are not yet finalized.\nCloser to home in Maryland, Kamala Harris won with 63% of the votes. Donald Trump received 34.4% of the votes. Democrat Angela Alsobrooks was elected to the Senate by 528,659 votes as compared to Republican Larry Hogan's 433,416 votes. She is one of two new senators who is Black and female. The other is the new senator from Delaware, Lisa Blunt Rochester (D).\nIn Talbot County, the latest tally (dated Nov. 11) was Trump 11,125 votes and Harris 11,119 votes. This difference of six votes does not a landslide make. Three districts in Talbot County voted for members of the Board of Education. Ann C. O'Connor in District 2 received 1,678 votes. Karla Wieland-Cherry in District 5 received 1,590 votes and Cynthia Marrah Jurrius in District 6 received 1,523 votes.\nThe reason, I include these results is that Ms. Jurrius was the only one recommended by the teachers. Voters may not have been aware that Ms. O'Connor and Ms. Wieland-Cherry apparently belong to a conservative national group called Moms for Liberty. They advocate for changes in curriculum and policies. The meetings of the Board of Education in Talbot County may become very interesting.\nThe fact that Donald Trump did not win by a landslide does not negate that he won a trifecta of power — the presidency, the Senate and the House. Like many presidents before him, he will have two years to make the changes with which he has threatened. If the voters do not approve of his plans to arrest the undocumented and putting them in concentration camps or tariffs on friendly countries such as Canada and Mexico, the midterm elections may stop Trump in his tracks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "What happened? Professor explains Trump's victory to local Dems\n\n December 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 843\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n What went wrong this November? What happened? Democrats, have been asking that question since President-elect Donald Trump won the White House seat against Vice President Kamala Harris.For Kent County Democrats, last month, they looked to Dan Nataf, professor of political science history, political science and philosophy at Anne Arundel Community College, for the answers.\nSince 1995, Nataf has directed the Center for the Study of Local Issues, which conducts surveys of Anne Arundel County residents and students. He's been \"passionate how material interests, institutional frameworks and ideology interact to shape political outcomes.\"\nHis background makes him a good candidate, pun intended, to explain what happened, lending his expertise to the Zoom meeting attended by members of the Democratic Club of Kent County and the Kent County Democratic Central Committee.\nTrump won, Nataf said, but how?\nHe said because despite what their political opponents claim, it was within a small margin of victory...not by a landslide.\nNataf added, seven million people who voted for Biden in 2020, stayed home this time; that made the difference.\nSeven million disappeared, and he explained why, looking into the past.\nIn 1980, Nataf stated, a democratic model of governance shifted to a more economic model. A newfound emphasis was placed on free trade, low taxes and small government, he noted.\nNataf listed off a multitude of reasons for this shift.\nThe dependency for the working class waned because of automation. The fear of being attacked after the Cold War was gone, and so the working class were not as valued in some influential circles as they once were.\nCompanies moved out and found low-cost labor, avoiding unions, Nataf explained.\nA gender divide was created too, Nataf said, because there was a new focus on white collar jobs, not blue collar jobs, and so women could compete with men. This also created a college/blue collar divide as well.\nIn this mode of thinking, Nataf noted, the rich got richer, and America gets split into winners and losers.\nNataf said the thinking was winners went to college and found white collar jobs.\nThis philosophy affected everyone.\nOn the Republican side they became neoconservatives; Democrats became neoliberals, Nataf said. And this philosophy drove the parties for years, the professor added.\nHe illustrated that through those years, neoliberals like former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama unified their party. The Democrats did not break from that leadership.\nBut within the Republican camp, there arose a mistrust for neoconservative leadership, Natal said. Under former President George W. Bush, after 9/11, many conservatives were discontent by what they viewed as their leaders' endless wars.\nNataf painted a picture the conditions were ripe for a charismatic leader to move in. With many Democrats attached to the universities, and blue collar Republicans disillusioned, angry, many years later — 2014, enter Trump.\nAccording to Nataf, Trump won using a zero-sum model.\nHe preached America first and that the country should not be the world's savior. That was different from the Republican leadership, Natal said.\nTrump talked about immigration in the negative which goes along with his list of the undeserving, Nataf said. The professor said Trump listed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ukrainians and immigrants especially as undeserving, Nataf said.\nNataf said with this rebellion from traditional leadership, Trump used the zero-sum model to ultimately take over the Republican Party, taking advantage of the lower class.\nThere were many other reasons Nataf gave for Trump's victory as well.\nHe said that President Joe Biden should have exited the race sooner. He called those who voted for Trump ill-informed, and at times, \"couch potatoes,\" in their research.\nHe said that after Covid-19, and the economical instability, it would have been challenging for the incumbent party to win anyway.\nNataf then took some time in his lecture for questions. There were a few. One woman made more of a statement, when she said America was not willing to vote for a \"woman of color.\" She also said that Trump divided men and women as a strategy.\nNataf thought the latter was a good point, claiming that Trump, when faced with Harris, put on the alpha male persona. He said that an angry populace took to Trump's \"macho behavior,\" and Harris' \"joy\" was not relatable.\nNataf repeated, it was a narrow margin of victory.\nHe said most of the country already decided on who they were voting for. The votes were already \"baked in,\" he mentioned, therefore it just took a small amount of voters to stay home to make a big change.\nOverall, though, Nataf's message was that Trump won the blue collar workers, those who were forgotten about by Democrats since the 80's.\nAnd so the question was what can Democrats do to win them going forward?\nWould the Democrats have to move more to the center, Nataf asked his audience.\nOr, he said, perhaps Trump will be so bad the Democrats would not have to move at all. They will naturally come back to the party after seeing who they voted for.\n\"It is going to take some self-reflecting,\" Nataf acknowledged referring to the Democrat party.\nThe Democratic Club of Kent County meets most months in Chestertown, on the third Thursday of the month.

Key, a preeminent scholar on American elections and voting behavior.\nKey's criteria for a realignment election includes shifts in party attachment that extends over several presidential elections and appear to be independent of the peculiar factors that influenced the vote at individual elections.\nUsing Key's criteria, a determination if the 2024 presidential election marks the start of a political realignment cannot be made yet. It may be eventually but only if the results of future consecutive elections replicate the results of the 2024 presidential cycle elections.\nFor now, we know the 2024 presidential election was a performance evaluation decision on President Joe Biden's policies and priorities. After Vice President Kamala Harris replaced Biden on the ballot, the election became an opportunity to gauge voter approval on their expectations on policies and priorities in a Harris administration.\nWe also now know the Harris campaign failed to convince a majority of voters that her administration would be different from the Biden administration. Nothing more, nothing less.\n2024 also provided voters with performance evaluation decisions for three long-term incumbent Democratic U.S. senators from Ohio, Pennsylvania and Montana. All three lost in their reelection bids. In West Virginia, a Republican candidate was elected to replace a Democratic incumbent senator who retired in anticipation of losing reelection.\nEventually, the 2024 presidential and U.S. Senate elections may become viewed as the first in a series of elections that taken together, are true realignment elections. The next election cycles that will help answer the realignment question will be the 2026 Congressional mid-term elections and the 2028 presidential election (one unlikely to have an incumbent candidate).\nWhich party will do well going forward will be determined in large part to who responds best to key unanswered questions as well as to lessons learned from the 2024 presidential election.\nFor the Republican Party, key unanswered questions from 2024 include:\nCan they maintain support from the influential and demanding MAGA wing of the party? Some MAGA Republicans are already angry over reports that four Republican senators opposed Matt Gaetz's nomination for attorney general (now withdrawn at Gaetz's request). More importantly, can the Republican Party retain blocs of historically Democratic voters who gave higher levels of support to Trump in 2024 than he received from them in 2016 and 2020. That largely unexpected outcome included to varying degrees, more support for Donald Trump and other down ballot Republican candidates from young Black male voters, Hispanic/Latino voters, young male voters, working class voters and urban voters.\nFor the Democratic Party, key unanswered questions from 2024 include:\nCan they maintain support from the influential and demanding progressive wing of the party? Already, some progressive Democrats are resisting any effort to pivot to more centrist positions on issues such as immigration restrictions, immigration deportations, deficit spending and aid to Israel. More importantly, can the Democratic Party regain blocs of historically Democratic voters who gave lower than anticipated support for Kamala Harris?\nAll things considered, I suggest the most important avenues to future election success for both parties, are candidates who do the best job of executing the following campaign strategies.\nListen intently to the voters. Remember that listening is more than waiting for your turn to talk. Remember to seek first to understand, then seek to be understood.\nRespect what voters are saying, whether or not you agree with them. Meet them where they are, not where you think they should be.\nAccept voter message development counsel from media guru Frank Lunz. \"It's not what you say or write, it is what people hear or read. You can have the best message in the world, but the person on the receiving end will always understand it through the prism of their own emotions, preconceptions, prejudices and preexisting beliefs. Get your audience to visualize … imagine. Only when people can see a better future will they consider a change.\"\nHave confidence your party can deliver measurable results on campaign promises. There is always another election cycle when voters can exercise their right to vote against candidates they perceive to be unresponsive to their views on what matters most to them.\nWith regard to the question of whether the 2024 presidential election was the first in a series of elections that will result in a political realignment that bodes well for Republican presidential candidates as well as other Republican candidates long term, the answers are:\nTo be determined.\nTime will tell. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Delaware woman among 39 people pardoned by Biden\n\n December 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff and wire reports | Section: News \n \n 541\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A woman from Bear, Delaware is among the 39 people pardoned by U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday.Patrice Chante Sellers, now 49, pleaded guilty to distribution of cocaine in 2003, according to court records. She was sentenced to six months house arrest and three years of probation.\nA Biden spokesperson said that under current law and sentencing practice, Sellers likely would not have been prosecuted federally.\n\"Since her conviction, Ms. Sellers enrolled in school, earning multiple certifications and licenses,\" the White House statement said in a statement. \"She gives back to her community by donating clothing and toiletries to a transitional housing program and offering encouragement to its residents. Community members describe Ms. Sellers as someone who goes above and beyond for others.\"\nSellers' pardon is part of the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history. In addition to the 39 pardons, Biden also commuted the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe commutations announced Thursday are for people who have served out home confinement sentences for at least one year after they were released. Prisons were uniquely bad for spreading the virus and some inmates were released in part to stop the spread. At one point, 1 in 5 prisoners had COVID-19, according to a tally kept by The Associated Press.\nBiden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions. The second largest single-day act of clemency was by Barack Obama, with 330, shortly before leaving office in 2017.\n\"America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances,\" Biden said in a statement. \"As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses.\"\nThe clemency follows a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for gun and tax crimes. Biden is under pressure from advocacy groups to pardon broad swaths of people, including those on federal death row, before the Trump administration takes over in January. He's also weighing whether to issue preemptive pardons to those who investigated Trump's effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and are facing possible retribution when he takes office.\nClemency is the term for the power the president has to pardon, in which a person is relieved of guilt and punishment, or to commute a sentence, which reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesn't exonerate the wrongdoing. It's customary for a president to grant mercy at the end of his term, using the power of the office to wipe away records or end prison terms.\nThose pardoned Thursday range in age from 36 to 75. About half are men and half are women, and they had been convicted of nonviolent crimes such as drug offenses, fraud or theft and turned their lives around, White House lawyers said. They include a woman who led emergency response teams during natural disasters; a church deacon who has worked as an addiction counselor and youth counselor; a doctoral student in molecular biosciences; and a decorated military veteran. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trump moving with urgency through transition\n\n December 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 793\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As President-elect Donald Trump moves forward on a transition to his second term, he is affirming his oft-stated objective to be a disrupter to business as usual in Washington, D.C.He is doing so in several ways.\nFirst and foremost, Trump has been moving quickly on choosing individuals for his cabinet, sub-cabinet positions and senior staff positions.\nNot surprisingly, this has generated criticism from media outlets, individuals in academia and not-for-profit organizations like the Partnership for Public Service, a group that identifies itself as a nonpartisan advocate focused on building a better government and stronger democracy.\nWith regard to the media, the headline for a recent Associated Press article was — \"Trump sets records with pace of appointments, but that doesn't mean the transition is going smoothly.\"\nIn the article, the reporter mixed news with opinion, when he wrote, \"In the two weeks since Election Day, President-elect Donald Trump has been setting records with the pace of appointments for his incoming administration. But speed shouldn't be confused with organization.\"\nWith regard to academia, David Marchick, dean of the Kogod School of Business at American University and co-author of a book on presidential transitions, has said, \"Last time they were slow and disorganized, this time they're fast and disorganized.\"\nWith regard to the Partnership for Public Service, Max Stier, their president and CEO, has said that Trump's team is missing a critical component of the process. Stier noted Trump is moving at least four times as quickly at rolling out his cabinet as his modern predecessors, but added: \"They're moving with speed, but they're making new mistakes.\"\nStier identified one of the biggest mistakes is a lack of proper vetting saying, \"He's going at breakneck, reckless speed because there's no vetting. Moving fast isn't a very good strategy if you don't move well — and they're not moving well.\"\nStier also has said, \"It's being done quickly, but it's being done without the kind of due diligence that ordinarily takes place and ensures that mistakes are not made.\"\nWith regard to Stier's observation on due diligence, I suggest that recruiting individuals for serving at high levels in government is a most challenging process. As a result, there are never foolproof ways to ensure that mistakes are not made.\nStier's criticism on vetting and due diligence is a moot issue now as Trump's transition team recently signed an agreement with the Justice Department to conduct FBI background checks despite them not being required by law.\nA quick review of the Trump transition efforts to date reflects that he has announced choices for 31 cabinet secretaries and sub cabinet positions that require Senate approval, and 28 senior staff positions that do not require Senate approval.\nTo date, only two announced choices are no longer under consideration: former Congressman Matt Gaetz for attorney general and Hillsborough County Florida Sherriff Chad Chronister to head the federal Drug Enforcement Agency. Gaetz has said his withdrawal from further consideration was voluntary, Trump has said the Chronister withdrawal from further consideration was not voluntary, despite earlier comments from Chronister that it was.\nTrump is not the first president-elect to experience challenges with candidate vetting.\nPrevious President-elects whose announced choices withdrew from consideration before Senate consideration include Clinton (four times), George W. Bush (three times), Obama (two times) and Biden (one time). The Senate also rejected George W. Bush's secretary of defense choice which was unexpected since his nominee was a former three-term U.S. senator.\nDonald Trump is proceeding with an acute awareness (reinforced in last month's congressional election results) that control in Congress is subject to change at any time. This is the case especially after midterm elections, but also by members leaving Congress due to a debilitating illness, death, early retirement and resignations to accept other opportunities.\nTrump knows that despite their current minority status in Congress, Democratic members of Congress are preparing strategies and tactics to aggressively challenge, modify or stop the plans of the Trump administration over the next four years. These strategies and tactics are more likely to succeed if members of the Democratic party flip control of one or both houses of Congress anytime during Trump's four-year term.\nAccordingly, Donald Trump and his advisors are proceeding on a transition and a governing philosophy in a manner consistent with an observation of Harvard Professor John Kotter in his book \"A Sense of Urgency.\"\nKotter writes: \"The single most crucial factor in achieving permanent and meaningful change is a continuous sense of urgency. A true sense of urgency occurs when you acknowledge action on critical issues is needed now, not eventually, not when it fits easily into your schedule. Now means making real progress every single day. Urgent behavior is not driven by a belief that all is well or that everything is a mess but, instead, that the world contains great opportunities and great hazards.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Who cares.This has been going on with presidents for the last 200 years, both Republican and Democrat. The only difference is they usually wait until hours before their final departure on the last day. It's small potatoes pertaining to this country's much needed, work at hand. This country is broken.\nThe Justice Department is at the top of the list. It's weaponized, pure and simple. All the cases against President Trump were all far-reaching garbage. Proof does exist that a Biden White House line of communication did exist with the prosecutors in all five cases. Are we to believe that White House lawyers were needed to facilitate these cases? State lawyers just weren't capable? Tell that to Alvin Bragg's office who prevailed in a sham case where federal prosecutors all passed. This one's sure to be overturned on appeal.\nWe're supposed to swallow that Biden is not accountable for mishandling of classified material but President Trump is? What about the Clinton sock drawer president? A federal judge has already ruled on this issue. Even if Jack Smith did prevail in a D.C. courtroom, it was always going to be thrown out on appeal.\nAnd why if Trump was not convicted of any criminal violation in the E. Jean Carrol case, should a N.Y. Leftist court award her even one dime? She first brought this allegation in 2019 during Trump's first presidency and more than 24 years after its alleged occurrence in 1995. An $83 million judgement. More lawfare.\nFinally, the shame of the century, the N.Y. fraud lawsuit conviction, where there were no victims, and only industry-accepted accounting practices used to precure business loans. This N.Y. hack judge erroneously attributes a value on the Mar-a-Lago property, under valuing it by more than $50 million and upon Trump's easily overturn able conviction, awards New York a whopping $364 million judgment. More lawfare.\nWell there's a new sheriff in town, and he learned plenty in his first term. The country has spoken, and it's time to return America to what it once was, a government of law, not men.\nBondi, Patel and Ratcliffe and Homan are just the right people to allow President Trump to govern while they start the long arduous task of overhauling this corrupt mess of a county. The louder the machine protest, the more we know we're on the right track.\nCRAIG WILLIS\nSt. Michaels \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Zion United Methodist Church in Mechanicsville participated in the event for the fourth year.\n\"It's a busy time of the year; I know people are off doing other things,\" said Larry Hill, who is a member of the United Methodist Men's Group that coordinates and sponsors the event for the church, \"but this is an opportunity to recognize the veterans at Christmas.\"\nThe event at the Mechanicsville church featured guest speaker Rear Adm. John Lemmon. A bugler played Taps\" while Hill read the names of the 75 veterans interred in the cemetery, which go \"all the way back to the Civil War, both sides of the Civil War,\" Hill said.\nIn Pomfret, St. Joseph Catholic Church held a mas, followed by the event. Duncan S. Moore will play the national anthem on the bagpipes, parishioner Karen Kleyle will read \"A Soldier's Poem\" and guest speakers will be the Rev. Harry Stokes and La Plata American Legion Post 82 Commander and retired Chief Master Sgt. Jamie Zayas, who had a 37-year military career.\n\"Women parishioners were saying prayers during November, which the Catholic Church reserves that month for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, and that's when we noticed how many veterans were buried there,\" St. Joseph Catholic Church Wreaths Across America Coordinator Tammy Hilburn said of the approximately 100 veterans. \"And we felt that it had to be addressed, so that set the whole event in motion.\"\nAll Saints Episcopal Church is Sunderland held its third Wreaths Across America event.\nBugler Eric Pfeiffer played \"Taps,\" Malinda Markland sang the anthem and a moment of silence was held across the church's Sunderland campus before the laying of 38 wreaths.\n\"I just think it's a very spiritual ceremony as well and it's a way to not only reflect on the veterans and express gratitude for those that are buried in our cemetery, but also express gratitude to those veterans that are still living and serving,\" said All Saints Wreaths Across America Coordinator Martha Hyde, who added she has a couple of generations of relatives interred in the cemetery.\nAlso attending was Hyde's 99-year-old father, Gordon Grahame, who was drafted as an 18-year-old and served as a SeaBee in Okinawa, Japan.\nCaron said 4,909 participating locations nationwide will be holding Wreaths Across America events, an increase of 740 over last year, with about a million volunteers.\nAccording to the Wreaths Across America website, Merrill Worcester donated surplus wreaths from his Maine-based Worcester Wreath Company to Arlington National Cemetery beginning in 1992 as a way of saying thanks to veterans. In 2005, a photo of wreaths on tombstones after a snowfall at the cemetery went viral and Wreaths Across America began as a nonprofit in 2007.\n\"As a veteran I think we owe it to those who served before us,\" said Hill, who was drafted in 1972 and spent three years in the Army, including 15 months in Germany.\nFor more information on Wreaths Across America, go to www.wreathsacrossamerica.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This is it. We take care of our community, we take care of our veterans. American people taking care of American people.\"\nThe Legion continually collaborates with the community, especially schools as it is important to teach children the values of what it means to be an American and respecting freedoms made possible by sacrifices made along the way, Randolph said.\nWith fundraisers throughout the year and tremendous community support, American Legion 278 is on a mission to put a wreath on every veteran grave in Queen Anne's County. Thus far, American Legion 278 has raised money for over 900 local veteran grave wreaths.\nAccording to Randolph, through its help to Wreaths Across America, Post 278 has been recognized for setting the bar of service, not just in Maryland, but across the country.\n\"Its pretty cool that this tiny little island has such an impact on Wreaths Across America,\" she said.\nDeparting Kent Island, the convoy joined ceremonies throughout Washington for National Wreaths Across America Day 2024.\nMembers of the American Legion wished the convoy, now become an extended family over the years, a safe trip as they continued their mission to ensure those who have served are never forgotten.\n\"Our hearts ride with you,\" Randolph said.\nDonations to support local American Legion wreaths, as well as more information about how to continually remember, honor, and teach can be found at wreathsacrossamerica.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "NASA says ‘High risk’ Goddard project had unrealistic launch schedule\n\n December 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Shaun Chornobroff and James Matheson Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 610\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — NASA described a plan to launch a multi-billion dollar spacecraft in 2026 as \"overly optimistic and not credible\" in a September letter to Maryland lawmakers that Capital News Service obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.On Sept. 4, NASA informed Congress it was ending the $2 billion OSAM-1 project, which was expected to service existing satellites and expand their lifespans in space, among other capabilities.\nTwelve days after the announcement, nine Maryland lawmakers demanded that NASA explain why it cancelled the project, which was based at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt.\nIn its response, dated Sept. 25, NASA cited numerous risks, an overly ambitious plan and a low return on investment as rationales for ending the project.\n\"The majority of NASA technology demonstrations are less complex and have orders of magnitude lower project lifecycle costs (in the $10 million-$100 million range) than OSAM-1,\" said the letter signed by Alicia Brown, NASA's associate administrator for the office of legislative and intergovernmental affairs. \"Therefore, NASA is willing to take more risk in managing these technology demonstration projects. … OSAM-1 is considered by NASA to be a high cost and highly complex project.\"\nMultiple parts of NASA's response were redacted in the copy of the letter CNS obtained.\nSince its start in 2015, the OSAM-1 project has been subjected to sizable cost increases and delays, leading to NASA first announcing the mission's shutdown on March 1. The agency has stood firm on its decision despite urging from the Congress, especially members of the Maryland delegation.\nThe NASA website for the project says the OSAM-1 mission \"is developing an unprecedented capability for a robust, cost-effective space infrastructure.\"\nDespite NASA's insistence on cancelling the mission, Maryland lawmakers continually have advocated for OSAM-1 to proceed, citing the importance of the project and the efforts of the workers at Goddard. As of Aug. 31, OSAM-1 had 249 contractors and 76 civil servants associated with the project, the letter said.\nIn a statement, Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Maryland Reps. Steny Hoyer and Glenn Ivey, maintained their criticism of NASA for ending the mission. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger separately told CNS he concurred with the sentiments of his fellow Democrats.\n\"This critical program provided NASA a distinct solution to a difficult challenge: maintaining our satellites in space,\" the lawmakers said.\n\"With the capabilities being developed by OSAM-1, NASA had the opportunity to both service satellites while still in orbit and extend the useful lives of these valuable assets,\" they said. \"In its shortsighted decision to cancel this mission, NASA has put these important long-term benefits aside, while also undermining the tireless efforts of our Goddard workforce.\"\nAn OSAM-1 independent review estimated development of the mission would cost $1.6 billion, a 200 percent increase since its inception. Originally targeted to launch in 2020, OSAM-1 was years behind schedule.\nCongress provided $227 million for OSAM-1 in the 2024 fiscal year budget and had a 2026 target launch for the spacecraft.\nIn the letter, NASA said any plan for a 2026 launch would involve risks not normally taken for a project this expensive. To execute the mission, NASA would have had to treat OSAM-1 as a Class D mission according to the letter, which normally represents a \"lower priority mission with medium to low complexity.\"\nThe cost to launch the proposed mission would be $353 million as of Oct. 1, while the shut down costs are $29 million, according to the letter.\nOne of the major dangers of the 2026 plan, according to the letter, was a reduction in testing. With the new plan, there would be less testing on the overall system, on the launch site and on some of the systems within the spacecraft. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "World of Warcraft: There is a new arms race driven by AI, surveillance, drones & robots\n\n December 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: News \n \n 1188\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Pentagon recently issued the first draft of a sweeping $15 billion artificial intelligence contract.The military contract would be the largest U.S. government AI contract ever.\nAnd it's just the tip of the spear.\nThe U.S. military and intelligence agencies — which have a combined budget approaching $1 trillion — are charging into the new and uncertain world of AI, robotics and drones.\nIrina Tsukerman, an attorney specializing in national security and president of consulting firm Scarab Rising Inc., said the U.S. Defense Department is integrating AI into command and operational systems. The agency's innovation units like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) are developing autonomous and AI-driven weaponry, she said.\n\"There are a whole range of weapons that use AI technology,\" she said.\nOn Dec. 11, the Pentagon announced the formation of the AI Rapid Capabilities Cell \"focused on accelerating DoD adoption of next-generation artificial intelligence,\" according to a statement.\n\"We need an all-hands-on-deck approach to accelerate development and deployment of these tools for the Department of Defense to responsibly harness the tremendous promise of AI in everything from financial management to logistics to operations planning to autonomous systems,\" said Radha Plumb, DoD chief digital and AI officer.\nThe Pentagon has already been undertaking a large $11 billion AI infrastructure build-out, according to Yashin Manraj, CEO of Oregon-based Pvotal Technologies.\n\"They have their own data centers,\" he said of U.S. military and intelligence agencies' technical infrastructure to help process and secure all the data and AI they are and will be using.\nThe Pentagon also is building, testing and implementing large language models and hiring its own internal technology staff rather than contracting out some of those functions, Manraj said.\n\"They are recruiting heavily,\" he said.\nStill, Manraj says the Defense Department has increased its AI-related contracts as it embarks on a new age of warfare.\nDeputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen H. Hicks told attendees of an industry conference in August that the U.S. military was forging ahead with autonomous systems including robotic, un-crewed vehicles, naval vessels and drones via the Replicator program that aims to fast-track and take to scale battlefield and logistical innovations.\nThe U.S. isn't alone, with militaries in countries such as Israel and China coupling AI with surveillance. And the Ukraine-Russia war is seeing both sides use drones on the battlefield.\nDRONESDrones are fast becoming the new infantry, the new preferred frontline weapons with varying degrees of automation, cost and technological sophistication.\nManraj said drones and AI are getting real-time experiences and use in the war between Russia and Ukraine and in other conflict zones.\nThey have been used by Iranian proxy groups fighting Israel and looking to disrupt cargo ships in the Red Sea. Israel Defense Forces have used drones for surveillance, intelligence and reconnaissance in the current Middle East war. Israel also pulled off a high-tech feat of sabotaging and simultaneously blowing up pagers and walk-talkies used by Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria.\nConcern also is high in East Coast states such as New Jersey, New York and Maryland over unidentified objects, assumed to be drones, flying in the night skies.\nUnmanned systems are also increasingly linked to AI and automation.\n\"Drones are a primary way in which AI is being used in modern warfare today. Drones are becoming significantly more popular and useful, because they allow for military surveillance and action with minimized risk of danger for military personnel since they allow those controlling the drones to be in a separate location,\" said Edward Tian, CEO of GPTZero, a New York-based AI detection software company.\n\"AI technology is now helping to improve the effectiveness of drones, solving a lot of the common problems of manually controlled drones, like avoiding obstacles and allowing for better, more accurate monitoring,\" Tian said.\nROBOTICSAnders Indset, a technology author who focuses on its ethical intersections, said the next big steps with AI and automation are with \"groundbreaking advancements in autonomous humanoid robots.\"\n\"In 2024, the development of robots surged, with innovations that once seemed far-off now becoming imminent. The long-anticipated release of fully autonomous humanoids — previously confined to industrial settings — is approaching,\" said Indset, who has penned best-selling books on technology and business.\nHe points to robotic advancements from Boston Dynamics, Hanson Robotics, BMW and Tesla and a projected $250 billion in investment money in the segment.\nTsukerman sees uses for AI and autonomous systems with military logistics and supply chains.\n\"It can be used to manage inventory,\" she said.\nStill, military and intelligence agencies' aggressive moves into AI and autonomous realms bring up images and worst-case scenarios from dystopian science fiction movies such as \"The Terminator\" and \"2001 Space Odyssey.\"\nWhen will the robots and machines turn against us?\nKristian Humble, an international law professor and AI expert at the University of Greenwich in London, compares the AI military race to the nuclear arms race during the Cold War.\n\"The escalating weaponization of AI parallels the nuclear arms race of the Cold War, with nuclear weapons being replaced with automated weapons systems,\" he wrote in an analysis for Georgetown University earlier this year. \"However, the international community, the United Nations and international law have been struggling to adapt to and regulate the use of automated weapons, which are rapidly changing the landscape of modern warfare.\"\nTsukerman cautioned against overreliance on AI and automated systems, pointing to the potential high-tech security lapses that resulted in the slow Israeli response to the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that ignited the current Middle East war.\n\"There was no human element to detect the threat. I think there has to be some level of human support,\" she said, noting that some kind of hacking or cyber attack could have delayed Israeli detection or response.\nSURVEILLANCEAI has already been transforming the world of surveillance.\nChina's Skynet system (which shares the name of the mythical high-tech military system in The Terminator movies) has a network of 600 million security surveillance cameras that is tied to a social credit system that rewards behaviors deemed \"good\" and sanctions those with undesirable behaviors, including government opposition.\nSkynet and its Orwellian social credit system have increasingly been linked to AI.\nIn the U.S., surveillance — including facial recognition technology — is being rolled out at airports by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and is used by police agencies.\nThat creates privacy and \"Big Brother\" worries.\nA cadre of U.S. senators — including Democrats Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republicans such as Steve Daines of Montana and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming — have voiced concerns about the use of facial recognition technology at airports.\nA U.S. Transportation Security Administration spokesperson said the security checkpoint face scans are voluntary and images are not retained except for quality control checks.\nArunkumar Thirunagalingam, senior manager for data and technology operations at McKesson Corp., expects to see more surveillance technology deployed worldwide for various purposes, including \"to monitor and control populations.\"\nHe sees growth avenues in the U.S.\n\"Concerns about national security and crime prevention could lead to expanded use, especially in critical areas like border control, public spaces, and cybersecurity,\" Thirunagalingam said.\nManraj said governmental and military players along with private companies are all part of ever-growing data collection and global sales of that information for various purposes.\n\"We have access to so much data. They are just a credit card away,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Trump Defense pick worries some Maryland veterans\n\n December 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ROBERT STEWART Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1178\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For veteran Jennifer Hunt, the recent rehashing of women's ability to serve in combat has been a distraction from the profound issues the Department of Defense has to deal with.\"It's research, development, acquisition, the strategy of countering China and the pivot towards Asia,\" Hunt, a resident of Clarksburg, said. \"It does a disservice to how important this job is to talk about this one narrow role.\"\nAn Army sergeant first class and decorated veteran, Hunt said the debate harkens back to old and outdated ideas. As a member of the Individual Ready Reserve, Hunt said her views are her own and do not reflect those of the DOD.\n\"It's just kind of surreal,\" she said, to be \"talking about 'women in combat, can they do it?' when, really, women have served in combat in like every war that America has had going back to the Revolutionary War.\"\nLately, the subject of gender and the military is taking on new life.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's appointee to head the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, has questioned the wisdom of women in combat. In addition, the conservative Project 2025 plan on presidential transition raises the idea that people with \"gender dysphoria\" should not serve in the military.\nThe debate has lit up the network of women veterans, in Maryland and elsewhere. Maryland is home to roughly 348,000 veterans, about 15% of whom are women, according to 2023 Veterans Affairs data.\nAnthony Woods, Maryland's secretary of the Department of Veterans and Military Families, responded to the current debate by praising the contributions women have made in war.\n\"During both of my deployments to Iraq,\" Woods told Capital News Service in an email, \"I had the honor of serving alongside courageous women who navigated the same dangerous streets and undertook equally challenging missions, despite restrictions on their roles in combat.\"\nBut that debate is likely only just beginning, as Trump moves toward putting his own mark on the Pentagon and every other federal agency. CNS interviewed several women veterans who worry about the fallout.\nLori Reynolds, a Baltimore native who spent three and a half decades in the Marine Corps before retiring at the rank of lieutenant general, said the question should be about the value women bring to the service.\nWhile leading hundreds of Marines in Iraq and thousands in Afghanistan, Reynolds said, she saw women make contributions in battle only they could make.\nDuring her tour in southwest Afghanistan, Reynolds said, she saw well-trained, capable women riding in convoys and attaching to combat units to go all across the battlefield.\n\"They were able to do what men in particular couldn't do,\" Reynolds said. \"They were allowed to talk to the Afghan women.\"\nThat brought valuable intelligence to commanders in the U.S. military, she said.\nBut at that time women were still excluded from combat, as a 1994 Pentagon policy did not allow women in combat zones. The lines were blurred in the theaters of war, she said.\nAlso, combat is not just about using lethal force. Lethality, she said, you can find in any prison yard or in the streets of Baltimore. It's also about values.\nReynolds said good, ethical military leadership is based on rules and trust, and it unites people to fight for the values of the American flag.\n\"Every time I put my uniform on,\" Reynolds said, \"I'm representing everyone who fought for this, and it has to matter. It has to mean something. If it doesn't, it's only about winning and losing.\"\nThese values are particularly important to unify the country's all-volunteer force, she said.\n\"Warfare is changing,\" Reynolds said, \"and you know what you really need representing all of America at the tactical level in time of need is all of America. You need what all of us bring to the fight.\"\nIn 2013 the DOD released regulations that allowed qualified women to go to combat zones and even eventually enter combat roles.\nNow that the roles seem to be up for discussion again, Reynolds argues it's important to be specific about what exactly is under consideration.\nThere are all kinds of roles in combat. Currently, women can serve in the infantry at the very front lines and even in special forces, if they meet the standards.\nReynolds would like to see any DOD nominees explain exactly what they would like to see changed.\n\"I hope,\" Reynolds said of Hegseth, \"that his nomination hearings would draw this out of him in a very clear way.\"\nWomen being able to serve in combat didn't happen overnight. That's evident at the Military Women's Memorial in Arlington, Va.\nThe site is rich with evidence that highlights women's contributions to the military from the Revolutionary War to today, including their participation in combat.\nThe memorial has built a database to register and tell the stories of women who served. They've registered about 308,500 so far, according to their website.\nA senior advisor there, Marilla Cushman, ascribes the slow expansion of women participating in combat to the armed services needing women to help win wars.\n\"Why did women deploy to Europe in World War I,\" she asked. \"Because Pershing needed operators. During World War II, why did we bring women in? Because we needed that resource. We needed that talent, and kind of the same thing with Vietnam.\"\nCushman said that with each war the U.S. fought in the 20th century, the need for women's service led to new opportunities for them. The same happened during the first two decades of the 21st century because of the need for women in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nThe Pentagon finally expanding combat options to women is part of Jennifer Hunt's story.\nDuring her time in Iraq, Hunt sustained shrapnel wounds to her face, neck and back after a vehicle she was riding in was struck by a roadside bomb. She said she was subsequently awarded a Purple Heart, an award given to those wounded or killed serving in battle. Her service and award were detailed in a lawsuit filed against the DOD in 2012 seeking to rescind a combat exclusion directive.\nBut the lawsuit didn't go far.\nIn 2013, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta signed a memorandum that rescinded the exclusion policy and directed the forces to integrate women into newly opened positions by 2016. If forces wanted women to be excluded from particular roles, they would have to be narrowly tailored and based in evidence.\nToday, Hunt said that during her free time, while she waits for nomination hearings, she's pumping up her fellow women veterans who are talking about the issue.\nThe real issue for her is making sure whoever leads the DOD is the best person to lead the people who have served in uniform and the thousands of DOD civilians in Maryland.\nShe also said that Maryland residents have an important role to play here, because the DOD is a civilian-led institution. It's up to them to write to their senators, she said.\n\"Anybody who thinks that because they're a civilian, that they have no part in this, they have no voice,\" she said, \"no, you do.\"\n\"You are a citizen of this country. You can have an opinion and a voice on it,\" she said, \"because it is also an opinion of what we want our society to be.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘Hello Girl’ from Maryland may soon win a medal for her WWI service\n\n December 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ROBERT STEWART Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 955\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Marie Edmee LeRoux has been buried at the Fort Lincoln Cemetery here for 79 years, but she may soon win a gold medal for her service in World War I.LeRoux was one of 223 bilingual women deployed to France as telephone operators, often under combat conditions, as part of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. They were the country's first women soldiers, popularly known as the \"Hello Girls.\"\nThey've been long overlooked for their service. But now the U.S. Congress has approved a special congressional gold medal as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for the coming year. The measure now goes to President Joe Biden for consideration.\n\"It's a story that's been forgotten and needs to be told,\" LeRoux's granddaughter, Catherine Bourgin of McLean, Va., said. \"With the passage of the Congressional gold medal, that's what I want.\"\nWomen like LeRoux braved German submarines on the transport to the war front and disease and bombardment to serve in the signal corps under the American Expeditionary Forces. Their service helped set a precedent for women's service in the U.S. military and influenced support for the 19th amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote.\nGen. John Pershing requested that bilingual women operators deploy to France. They were more skilled and experienced at operating the new telephone systems of the time, and the AEF needed bilingual people to communicate with the French forces.\nLeRoux had those skills. She was born in Montreal and grew up speaking French and English before moving to the U.S. at age 10, according to Bourgin. She was a passionate singer but, according to Bourgin, LeRoux abandoned her music career to answer the call.\nLeRoux traveled to France in 1918, operating the switchboards that connected military commanders with the front lines and their French counterparts. She stayed in France after the war to restart her music studies. When war threatened France again in 1939, LeRoux fled the country with her 4-year-old daughter in tow. She eventually came to live near family in Prince George's County.\nShe passed away in 1945 and was interred in an unmarked grave here, according to her granddaughter. She did not receive a military headstone because she was not considered a veteran.\nMany women who served in the U.S. Army signal corps found out they weren't considered \"soldiers\" when they applied for benefits after the war. They received no veteran medical care and no federally funded rehabilitation training.\nThis was only remedied in 1977 when Congress acknowledged them as veterans, following decades of petitioning by Hello Girls like Merle Egan Anderson. Most had already passed away by then.\nWhile Bourgin was researching her grandmother's history, she discovered LeRoux was a member of the Hello Girls. She also learned that a congressional commission had recommended these female veterans receive a Congressional Gold Medal collectively.\nSo, in 2023, Bourgin began working with others to help her grandmother and the other Hello Girls get that medal.\nBourgin refers to the advocacy group as the \"Hello Girls Family,\" and she joined them to bring their story to Capitol Hill. Elizabeth Cobbs' 2017 book also helped reintroduce the women operators' war contribution into the mainstream.\n\"The telephone,\" Cobbs said, \"was the only way that they could rapidly communicate with troops who were facing mechanized onslaughts of the most destructive machinery ever devised by humans.\"\nWomen could operate the war switchboards faster than their male counterparts, she said. They couldn't even vote at the time, nor serve on juries in most states.\nChris Christopher led the advocacy charge.\nAs a former staffer on the World War I Centennial Commission that recommended in 2018 that the Hello Girls receive the award as part of the country's formal efforts to commemorate the war, Christopher thought getting the award across the finish line was important. In 2023, with no bill passed, Christopher decided to tackle the issue head-on.\n\"I sat down,\" Christopher said, \"and wrote a letter to every single senator who was not already a co-sponsor.\"\nIf a senator was not a co-sponsor, Christopher said, he researched and included World War I registration documents of a relative or ancestor of that senator to personalize the letters. He then made sure those were hand-delivered to the senators.\nVolunteering in his free time, he also coordinated the network of history buffs and Hello Girl descendants and supporters for virtual meetings and lobbying on the Hill.\nCatherine Bourgin had just discovered her grandmother's unmarked grave in Fort Lincoln Cemetery, in a plot next to her great-grandmother's. She also connected with Christopher at the same time.\nBourgin said her grandmother's grave was symbolic of what happened to the Hello Girls. LeRoux was in an unmarked grave, Bourgin said, just miles from the nation's capital but nevertheless lost to history.\nWhile lobbying on Capitol Hill a few months later, Bourgin said, she told other advocates about the unmarked grave. The group got fired up, she said, and decided to change that.\nThey procured the grave marker and arranged for a military honors ceremony at the cemetery.\n\"The folks that did what they did for my grandmother,\" Bourgin said, \"they truly made an indelible mark on my family's history.\"\nBourgin thinks the ceremony drew attention to the gold-medal cause. They made sure members of Congress were invited.\nNow it seems the advocacy may have worked. Senators are expected to take up the defense act in the coming days.\nBoth Bourgin and Christopher hope that the award will bring attention to the untold stories of the country's first female soldiers, and ensure that all of them have veteran's grave markers.\n\"There are so many stories out there like this,\" Bourgin said, \"and we just have to discover them.\"\n\"Hopefully once we get past all this, this is going to be something that will generate an ongoing effort,\" Christopher said. He wants \"to get all of the Hello Girls their appropriate grave marker.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Record homelessness in U.S., up 18% in one year, 36% since pandemic with spikes among families, kids\n\n December 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: National \n \n 419\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n More than 771,000 people are homeless in the U.S, according to the results of a 2024 one-night count conducted by the federal government and housing groups.That's up more than 18% from 2023 and the number of homeless families is up 39.4% from 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nThe HUD point-in-time count in January 2024 showed 771,480 homeless persons in the U.S. — a record high.\nThat is 118,376 more persons than in 2023 (up 18.1%) and 191,014 more persons than in 2020 (up 32.9%).\nHomelessness in the U.S. is up 35.9% from 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic, its job losses, social upheavals and ensuing inflation wave that brought 40 years highs in prices for food, transportation and housing as well as higher interest rates.\nThere were 567,715 homeless persons in 2019, according to HUD.\nThe number of homeless children in 2024 is close to 150,000 — up 33% from 2023, according to HUD's point-in-time count.\nMen and boys currently make up 59.2% of the overall homeless population in the U.S. including 67.4% of those living on the streets, according to HUD.\nWomen and girls comprise 39.2% of the overall homeless population and 44% of those in shelters, according to the January 2024 count.\nHomelessness is up 37.6% among women and 33.9% among men since the pandemic.\nIn Maryland, HUD counted 6,069 homeless persons statewide in its January 2024 tally. In January 2020 (just before the pandemic), Maryland's homeless county totaled 4,430 persons. That's a 37% increase since 2020.\nIn Delaware, there were 1,358 homeless persons counted statewide in HUD's 2024 report. In 2020, there were 1,165 homeless persons counted in Delaware. That translates into a 16.6 % increase since 2020\nPost-pandemic waves of migrants into the U.S. along with higher costs and behavioral and mental health crises during and since COVID have also contributed to the rise.\nIn 2019, HUD estimated New York's homeless population at 42,113. In 2024, that figure is 158,019. The Empire State's homeless population grew by 115,906 since before COVID and 54,819 since 2023.\nThe record counts alarm advocates and groups looking to address homelessness in the U.S.\n\"The answer to ending homelessness is ensuring everyone has access to safe, stable, and affordable housing. Our leaders must immediately expand the resources to rehouse people without homes and assist the rapidly growing number of people who cannot afford skyrocketing rents,\" said Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. \"This record-setting increase in homelessness should sound the alarm for federal, state, and local lawmakers to advance evidence-based solutions to this crisis.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This U.S. investment has strategic implications for U.S.-China economic competition.\nAnother example is the sale of excess border wall materials that was required by Congress in 2023 (The Texas Tribune, Dec. 20, 2024). Most of that material was given to the Customs and Border Protection and to the states of Texas and California. The material that is being auctioned off is mostly junk and not worth the cost of shipping, according to a Texas official.\nThen there's Ukraine where Russia launched an invasion in 2022 to try to claim the land. Russia, under Putin, is a bad actor, and it seems clearly in U.S. interests to prevent Russia from gaining international influence.\nAnd the suggestion that no money for our citizens who lost everything due to a hurricane appears contrary to real experience. My good friend in St. Petersburg, Florida, lost part of the roof on his house, and he reports that \"FEMA was surprisingly polite and efficient and came through with $5,000 of the $9,000 we needed.\"\nAmerica is great partly because the federal government — as imperfect as it is — is trying to do the right things and has produced better economic results than any other country in the world (The Economist, Oct. 19, 2024). This track record suggests that we should try to improve the government we have rather than start all over.\nRALPH MEYER\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Why empathy? Because it is obvious to me that Mr. Gondeck unwittingly obtained all his political information from unreliable, non-verified sources.Yes, Mr Gondeck, if our country were \"devastated\" by the current administration, if there really was an \"onslaught on the American taxpayer,\" if, in fact, victims of Hurricane Helene only received $750, if Mr Biden were \"selling the southern border wall for 5 cents on the dollar\" — if any of that were remotely true, I would be upset, too.\nI have good news for you. There are independent organizations, meaning no political affiliation whatsoever, readily available for you to fact check your sources. I'll try to put your mind at ease:\nJob growth in Biden's first three years was greater than any of his four predecessors, currently plus-15 million.

One week after the hurricane's landfall, FEMA distributed more than $45 million to those in need. (verify.com)Leftover materials from the southern border were auctioned off, as per a bill introduced by a Republican lawmaker that required the sale, transfer, or donation of all excess building material. (snopes.com)There has been a steady decline in violent crime, dropping 14.5% under Biden. \"Trump's claim that violent crime is up 45% is verifiably false.\" (factcheck.org)\nHere's one other resource for you.

    "content": "Our moral compass is broken ... that is worrisome\n\n January 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 800\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A dictionary definition of a moral compass is a set of beliefs or values that help guide ethical decisions, judgments and behavior, an internal sense of what is right and wrong.A dictionary definition of broken is something that is no longer whole or working correctly.\nAs has been reported regularly and with great public interest since early December, Brian Thompson, the CEO of United American Healthcare Insurance Company was ambushed, shot and killed while attending a business meeting in New York City.\nAfter reading a recent commentary authored by Adam Panucco and posted on Montgomery Perspective on the aftermath of that assassination, I suggest we are experiencing an emerging crisis due to a broken moral compass in American society.\nCase in point are recaps in Panucco's commentary of widespread reactions to the formal accusation of and trial for Luigi Mangione, on his alleged involvement in the assassination of Brian Thompson. Panucco wrote in part:\n\"Celebrations of the murder broke out on social media almost as soon as the killing was reported. The then unknown assailant had provided a public service by taking out a leader in a predatory and heartless industry, the killer's fans asserted. The jubilation grew in fervor as each newly released surveillance video confirmed the original impression that the killer, still at large, was young and handsome. Once an arrest was made, the lionization of the suspect, reached a frenzy. Luigi —always Luigi—was the 'hot assassin.' Merchandise featuring his image and phrases from a handwritten manifesto he had carried with him sprung up on Amazon. A video projection of Mangione's face was cheered at a rock concert in Boston. A crowdsourced defense fund quickly swelled with donations. Wanted posters appeared in Manhattan with pictures of other corporate CEOs. The names and salaries of health care executives were posted online. Private citizens who had helped with the manhunt were vilified as snitches, police officers involved in arresting alleged killer Mangione received threats.\"\nWhile these may be relatively isolated incidents, even more distressing was Panucco's recap of public polling results on this matter.\n\"Over 41 percent of respondents supported the Thompson assassination, or were at best ambivalent about it. Nearly 16 percent of respondents were 'unsure' or 'neutral' about whether the killer's actions were 'acceptable or unacceptable.' A little over 8 percent of respondents found Mangione's actions 'completely acceptable.' Another 8.4 percent found those actions 'somewhat acceptable,' and 9 percent found them 'somewhat unacceptable.' It is not clear how 'somewhat acceptable' differs from 'somewhat unacceptable.' Four of every 10 Americans, in other words, will not unequivocally condemn the killing. The younger the voter, the greater the level of support for political killings. Sixty-seven percent of voters aged 18 to 29 were ambivalent about or supportive of Mangione's actions, with only 33 percent finding those actions completely unacceptable. Fifty-seven percent of voters aged 30 to 39 were unwilling to condemn the killing unequivocally, with only 43 percent finding it 'completely unacceptable.' Democrats were nearly twice as likely as Republicans to find it either somewhat or completely acceptable.\"\nIn closing remarks in his thought-provoking commentary, Panucco asks:\n\"What has gone wrong with Americans' moral compass that so many could cheer the extrajudicial killing of an innocent man? That question has not been deemed worthy of exploring.\"\nI suggest what is wrong with America's moral compass is simple.\nOur moral compass is broken.\nTo the best of my knowledge this brokenness has not been deemed worthy of exploring.\nIt is imperative that we individually and collectively embrace the timeless principles contained in the United States Constitution, especially with regard to due process and the rule of law in America.\nWhile every American has a right to hold and express their opinion, every American has a right and an obligation to point out and challenge misguided and hypocritical opinions that reflect a broken moral compass.\nIt is indefensible that anyone would support, celebrate or glorify any accused killer who already has constitutional rights to:\nAn assumption of innocence until proven guilty.\nA properly processed an indictment, i.e., formal charge or accusation of a serious crime.\nAccess to legal counsel and representation.\nOpportunities during a trial for cross examinations.\nVerdicts on guilt or innocence on all charges.\nOpportunities to appeal all verdicts.\nThat person does not have any right to act alone as the judge, jury and executioner, thereby denying a murder victim the same rights, regardless of who he is or his occupation.\nIn his book, \"Democracy in America,\" Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, \"America is great because America is good. If America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.\"\nIf America does not take proper immediate steps to address the consequences of a broken moral compass going forward, our society will not only cease to be good and cease to be great, but will also ultimately cease to exist. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Donald Trump: 'I like thinking big, I always have'\n\n January 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 944\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In 1987, well before entering the political arena as a candidate for president the first time in 2016, Donald Trump wrote a bestselling book — \"The Art of the Deal.\"In promoting his book, Trump said, \"I like thinking big, I always have. To me it's very simple. If you're going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.\"\nDuring his third presidential campaign in 2024, Trump's campaign slogan and platform — \"Make America Great Again\" — was most certainly thinking big.\nTrump's proposed big ideas included new federal government policies and actions on immigration, energy, foreign affairs, taxes, government reorganization and government spending.\nHis big idea messaging resonated so well with voters, Trump was elected in 2024 winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College vote.\nHe was the first Republican presidential candidate to do that since George W. Bush in 2004.\nBranding his win as a mandate, Trump announced he wanted Congress to enact legislation implementing a wide range of his big ideas no later than May of this year.\nTo be seen: If he can convert his election success into governing success.\nIt will not be easy.\nIn 1513, political observer, philosopher and historian Nicolai Machiavelli wrote the following in his classic book, \"The Prince\":\n\"It must be remembered that that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies, all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.\"\nThis timeless advice is especially relevant when Trump will be dealing with Congress, a legislative body often characterized by a lot of talk and little meaningful action on significant changes to the status quo.\nEven with Republican majorities in both houses of Congress, expected to be the case for at least the next two years, Trump's efforts to secure approval of big ideas in Congress will be like herding cats.\nCase in point was recently warring factions within the Republican majority in the U.S. House deciding whether or not to retain or replace Speaker of the House Mike Johnson.\nIt brought back memories of another divisive speaker election where Republicans needed 16 rounds of voting to elect a new speaker after incumbent Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted from that position.\nThat experience was hardly a branding moment for House Republicans. It has been suggested that was one reason some Republican House candidates lost in November, losses that reduced their already slim majority in the House to two seats.\nThe final outcome on this most recent speaker election was a huge win for President-elect Trump.\nWithout a speaker, the House could not certify his election, which could have delayed his swearing in.\nOnly after Trump and Elon Musk pivoted from a largely hands-off position on Johnson being reelected to a strong endorsement of Johnson by both Trump and Musk, Johnson was reelected as speaker.\nNo doubt they were aided by Congressman Andy Harris, a loyal Trump supporter who now chairs the House Freedom Caucus. Several caucus members have long been critical of Speaker Johnson.\nHarris, also pivoted from announcing his uncertainty on supporting Johnson. Harris cast a vote for him near the end of the lengthy vote count where Johnson received just enough votes to win.\nPerhaps Andy remembered or was reminded that former Congressman and former Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good lost in a Republican primary to an opponent endorsed by Trump.\nFresh off a big win in the House speaker election, Trump's next steps are more challenging.\nSome Republican House members are already considering opposing using reconciliation legislation to consider and approve some of Trump's big thinking ideas.\nIn the Senate, Trump currently faces uncertainty on his nominations requiring Senate approval.\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune has said he does not know if all of Trump's choices for cabinet and sub-cabinet appointments will be supported by all the Republican senators. He has said candidly and bluntly — \"Some of them will make it, but I don't know if all of them will.\"\nThe largest looming challenge facing Trump is voter reaction to what legislation Congress approves and what they do not approve over the next two years.\nThe voters who elected Trump and Republican majorities in Congress know that if Trump's MAGA big idea agenda is not enacted by Congress with those majorities they will have opportunities to vent their frustration and displeasure as soon as the 2026 mid-term elections.\nIt is also possible if the historical pattern of mid-term elections could happen, a pattern where candidates of the President's party lose congressional races. Either way, Republican majorities in Congress could go away like melting snow on a warm winter day.\nThose election results could result in Democratic majorities in one or both house of Congress majorities that would never advance Trump's big ideas agenda.\nSuch results could challenge the notion that Republican wins in 2024 will be followed by a measurable realignment in American politics that favors Republicans going forward.\nI suggest the ultimate verdict on Trump's success on his big ideas will not depend on his thinking big ideas. It will depend on his success in delivering on the big ideas that meet the high expectations of the voters who elected Trump him and other Republicans in 2024.\nVoting against candidates (especially incumbent members of Congress) who fail to deliver on campaign promises made is how they may see the art of the deal. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The same point could have been made regarding the violent rioters who broke into the capitol four years ago and those who now applaud them.As a frequent contributor to the Star, Mr. Reel owes us more than the obvious conclusion that something is morally wrong. He needs to offer insights on how this compass is going to be fixed in light of the fact that the national leader we just elected fails a morality test by any reasonable standard (e.g., the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, or state and federal laws).\nRALPH MEYER\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The funeral included previously written eulogies by former President Gerald Ford and Carter's former Vice President Walter Mondale, read by their sons, Steven Ford and Ted Mondale.\nPresident Biden, who was the first Democratic senator to endorse Carter's bid for presidency in 1976, also gave a speech in honor of Carter.\n\"Throughout his life, he showed us what it means to be a practitioner of good works, a good and faithful servant of God and people today,\" he said. \"Many think he was from a bygone era, but in reality, he saw well into the future.\"\nGrandsons Joshua, Jason and James Carter spoke at the service. In an emotional tribute, Jason emphasized the love his grandfather brought to the world.\n\"He waged peace with love and respect,\" he said. \"He led this nation with love and respect. For me, this life was a love story from the moment that he woke up until he laid his head.\"\nCarter, the longest-lived president in U.S. history, died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. His work of making global public health and humanitarian rights central to his agenda drew praise and admiration from people of all political angles. His death marked the end of an era.\nOutside of the cathedral, through the sound of church bells, the beat of drums and brisk winds, onlookers remembered Carter for his love of the people.\nThi Le, a Washington resident, stepped out onto his porch to watch the funeral procession despite the biting cold.\n\"I was impressed by his relatively young age in the presidency and then his accomplishments after his presidency,\" Le said.\n\"I just turned 42, so I'm kind of comparing, what have I done with myself to this point?\" Le said. \"He was president in his 50s and obviously accomplished quite a bit. That was just the halfway point for him through his life.\"\nHsin-Fu Wu traveled from Tucson, Arizona, for the funeral. He recounted how Carter had stopped to speak with him on the submarine named after the president in the early 2000s. Carter's legacy is grounded in \"his persistence in bringing peace and to live in integrity despite the opposition of the politics,\" Wu said.\nHe proudly wore a navy blue baseball cap with \"USS Jimmy Carter\" embroidered across the front.\nNancy Edson shared her admiration for Carter's dedication, praising his post-presidency efforts to combat diseases and his work with Habitat for Humanity.\nStanding in the cold to witness the funeral procession, Edson told Capital News Service it was \"the least she could do for everything that he and his family did in the world.\"\n\"[I] hope that some of it can rub off on me, and I can do more to help the world in my own way,\" Edson said. \"I don't think I can do as much as he did, but you gotta start somewhere.\"\nMembers of the Maryland General Assembly also paid tribute to the late president.\n\"His presidency may have been marked by significant challenges, rising energy costs, inflation and international crises, but Carter consistently approached these issues with honesty, humility … and a deep commitment to doing what was right, not just what was politically convenient,\" said Sen. Benjamin Brooks Sr., a Democrat representing Baltimore County, speaking to the Maryland Senate on Thursday.\nHouse Speaker Adrienne Jones, a Democrat from Baltimore County, reflected on how Carter's policies shaped her life on the House floor in advance of the funeral.\n\"During his administration, he greatly expanded a federal program called the Comprehensive Employee and Training Act,\" Jones said. \"Thanks to him, I got my first job in public service. I had just graduated from UMBC and didn't know what my next step would be, but CETA was the answer.\"\nJones also praised Carter for demonstrating how government programs can empower individuals and communities.\n\"When I think about public service, I think of the late President Jimmy Carter,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Jimmy Carter: lifelong goal of service to others\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 638\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Jimmy Carter was both a nuclear engineer educated at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis and a strong supporter of nuclear disarmament in the world. He was a white, poor peanut farmer's son from Plains, Georgia, where only 20% of the population was white. He understood what it meant to be in the minority and told the Academy he was happy to share a room with a black midshipman.President Carter's main diplomatic achievement during his presidency was the Camp David Accords in 1978 between Israel and Egypt. Carter was hosting the two heads of state with staff in different cottages at Camp David in Maryland. These two countries had been at war since 1948, and Carter persuaded them to recognize each other and to cease the on and off wars that nobody won.\nJimmy Carter's one-term presidency ended when he could not persuade the young Iranian protesters to free the U.S. embassy staff they had taken hostage. But his diplomacy won in the end, as the embassy staffers were sent home shortly after President Reagan was inaugurated. They all came through that year alive. One small group of staffers absconded to the Canadian Embassy in Teheran from the outset and were smuggled out earlier by the Canadians. (See the movie Argo.) Carter's presidency also suffered from higher prices in the grocery stores and long lines of cars waiting to gas up.\nIt was after his presidency when Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn really blossomed. They established the Carter Center in Atlanta and joined Habitat for Humanity building affordable housing. For more than 30 years they worked with over 100,000 volunteers in 14 countries building, renovating or repairing more than 4,000 homes for the needy. We have a local Choptank Habitat for Humanity with many homes still built in Talbot and Dorchester counties by volunteers. When I first came out to the Shore, I worked on a Habitat home built by women volunteers.\nPresident Carter was very critical of apartheid in South Africa. He became a close friend of Nelson Mandela, who after 30 years of political imprisonment on Robins Island was freed and eventually was elected president of South Africa.\nIn the Carters' travels around Africa, they saw the blind beggars that I also have seen in Africa. Their blindness is caused by a disease called River Blindness. It is a tropical disease caused by a parasitic worm found in rivers and streams where people swim. The medication Ivermectin can treat the disease. Jimmy Carter saw to it through the Carter Center's employees and volunteers in Africa that this medication was given out free to villages around Africa, as it was very cheap to make.\nAfrica went from having hundreds of thousands of infections every year to 14 last year. This was Jimmy Carter's greatest success in saving lives now and in the future.\nIn 2002, Jimmy Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace prize for his dedication to humanitarian efforts around the world and trying to end international conflicts. The award is given by the Norwegian Nobel Committee to somebody whose work has benefited mankind and world peace. (The Swedish Nobel Committee gives out all the Nobel prizes in science and literature.) Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist and inventor of dynamite, made a lot of money from dynamite but believed in peace between countries.\nThe eulogies to Jimmy Carter given by dignitaries and relatives during his funeral celebration in the Washington National Cathedral portrayed a president and life thereafter with a lifelong goal of service to others. His grandson said, \"… in my 49 years I never perceived a difference between his public face and his private one. He was the same person no matter who he was with, or where he was, and for me that's the definition of integrity.\"\nHe was a president the likes of which we may never see again. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Crack forms in 'blue wall' of resistance to Trump\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 754\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n One of the many surprises in the last presidential election was Donald Trump winning in three \"blue wall\" battleground states — Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.Now that the reality of a second Trump term is sinking in, some Democratic members of Congress, Democratic governors, Democratic state attorney generals, and a large group of issue advocacy groups are working diligently to put up a new \"blue wall\" in Congress to delay or derail President-elect Trump's congressional agenda.\nThat proposed \"blue wall\" currently has an unexpected crack in an unexpected place — the United States Senate with John Fetterman, the Democratic U.S. senator from Pennsylvania.\nElected to the Senate in in 2022, Fetterman is the most unpredictable and unconventional member of the Senate since Arlen Specter, a former senator who was also from Pennsylvania.\nOnce elected, Fetterman was widely expected to be a conventional partisan progressive and a reliable supporter for progressive public policy positions.\nSince his election, he has demonstrated a level of independence that has surprised and disappointed progressives, and surprised and pleased conservatives.\nFetterman has regularly and forcefully expressed staunch support for Israel in their ongoing war with Hamas.\nOn immigration, Fetterman has said, \"I support a secure border.\" He also supports the deportation of undocumented immigrants arrested for crimes committed in America. He has said he doesn't know why anyone finds it controversial, that people illegally in the U.S. who commit crimes \"need to go.\"\nNow Fetterman is publicly challenging Democratic members of Congress who are developing strategies to resist and derail Trump's agenda in Congress.\nIn a recent interview with Jonathan Carl on ABC News \"This Week\", Fetterman said he hopes Trump is successful in his second term and he's not \"rooting against him.\" This follows Fetterman's pre-election endorsement of Kamala Harris for president and endorsing former long-term fellow Democratic U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania Bob Casey.\nHe also said, \"If you're rooting against the president, you are rooting against the nation. So, country first. I know that's become maybe like a cliche, but it happens to be true.\"\nThat observation is consistent with Fetterman's thought that in moving forward, Democrats can't get wrapped up in \"freaking out\" over every move that Trump makes.\nMost recently Fetterman further affirmed his independent nature by accepting an invitation to meet with President-elect Trump in Florida.\nFetterman announced his acceptance decision with his usual candor and bluntness, \"President Trump invited me to meet, and I accepted. I'm the senator for all Pennsylvanians — not just Democrats in Pennsylvania, I've been clear that no one is my gatekeeper. I will meet with and have conversations with anyone if it helps me deliver for Pennsylvania and the nation.\"\nFetterman has walked his talk with regard to his role as a senator, in voting to confirm or reject confirmation of some of Donald Trump's cabinet nominees.\nFetterman was one of the first Democratic senators to meet with Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice to serve as secretary of Defense.\nHe has said he will vote to confirm Elise Stefanik as ambassador to the United Nations and Marco Rubio as secretary of State.\nHe is still considering if he will vote to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services, and Tulsi Gabbard as director of National Security.\nWhile Fetterman's approach to working with the Trump administration is not yet widely accepted by Democratic members of Congress, it is not unique.\nAt least one Democratic member of Congress has already embraced Fetterman's approach to the Trump administration.\nIn a New Year's Day New York Times guest essay, Congressman Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) urged fellow Democratic lawmakers to drop the resistance movement and work with Trump in his second term.\nSuozzi wrote, \"As a Democratic member of Congress, I know my party will be tempted to hold fast against Mr. Trump at every turn, uniting against his bills, blocking his nominees and grinding the machinery of the House and the Senate to a halt. That would be a mistake. But as a common sense Democrat who won in a district that Mr. Trump also won, I am certain our closely divided electorate would rather have bipartisan solutions than political gridlock.\"\nGoing forward it will be most interesting to see if cracks in any congressional \"blue wall\" of resistance get bigger and deeper.\nWhile to date such cracks may be relatively small, they could expand to a point where a \"blue wall\" of resistance strategy is futile on stopping Trump's ambitious second-term agenda.\nWith slim Republican majorities in Congress, especially in the House, any support by Democratic members of Congress for Trump's congressional agenda significantly increases the odds for approval of that agenda. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Monumental advice on eve of Trump's inauguration\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MELINDA BURRELL | Section: Columns \n \n 560\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I love watching the brides pose for photos by the Lincoln Memorial and the teenagers wriggle through TikTok choreography near the Washington Monument. Their modern hopes breathe life into the centuries-old wisdom of our capital city.I have lived in Washington, D.C., for years and still can't get enough of it. On sunny Saturday morning walks, my pace is casual, but the insights are profound.\nD.C. is a living lesson about what George Washington described as \"the last great experiment for promoting human happiness.\"\nThe inauguration brings new people to Washington, and I hope they will love and learn from the city as much as I do.\nOne of my favorite monuments is near the Capitol. Two iron cranes stand together. Their wings thrust upward and barbed wire falls from their beaks. Around them is a complicated mix of names: Japanese Americans who died fighting for us in World War II, and the internment camps to which their families and friends had been forced.\nYet I am fiercely proud to be an American when, amidst these names, I read President Reagan's words: \"Here we admit a wrong. Here we affirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law.\"\nFew countries I've lived in have the strength to admit such a grave national error.\nThat urge for improvement is in our national genes. As the Constitution states, we're constantly trying to \"form a more perfect union.\"\nSure enough, a few miles away under a white marble dome stands a statue of Thomas Jefferson. He, too, speaks to us of striving for perfection: \"… Laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened … institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times.\"\nWhile I respect the somber challenge of those words, I love his next, more whimsical, sentence: \"We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.\"\nFrom a breezy hill in northeast Washington, D.C., President Lincoln also challenges us. It's the cottage where he and his family escaped the city's summer heat, though Lincoln daily commuted to the White House. His dusty horseback ride revealed the stakes of the Civil War: wounded soldiers bumping along in ambulances and former slaves surviving in hastily built camps after escaping behind Union lines.\nLincoln welcomed allies and adversaries alike to the cottage for advice, sometimes looking out from the veranda over the not-yet-completed Capitol and Washington Monument. As a modern visitor 150 years later, I can stand in the same place. The buildings are completed. But which of Lincoln's hopes and fears are still in progress?\nAt a newer memorial, Martin Luther King, Jr offers optimism about the timescale of our national effort: \"We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\"\nAt an even newer memorial closer to the Capitol, President Eisenhower puts a worldwide spin on our work of becoming a more perfect union: \"We look upon this shaken earth, and we declare our firm and fixed purpose — the building of a peace with justice in a world where moral law prevails.\"\nStrolling through the city, I love listening to leaders from different periods of our great experiment. I hope our elected representatives will as well. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He focused on the southern border and promised to declare a national emergency, begin the process of \"returning\" people to their countries and send troops to \"repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\"\nThe circumstances surrounding Trump's second inauguration made it different from most; for the first time since 1985, the ceremony took place indoors, away from bitter cold temperatures in D.C. Members of Trump's party included billionaires Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, as well as internet personality Joe Rogan, seated in premium seats.\nHis speech was unique, too. While former President Joe Biden's 2021 speech focused on unity and democracy, Trump spent his opening moments as president decrying what he views as a decaying America. He promised to usher in a new isolationist \"golden era\" for the nation.\n\"From this moment on,\" Trump said, \"America's decline is over.\"\nAs Trump spoke, and Republicans in the Capitol Rotunda cheered, Democrats at the ceremony were mostly quiet. Biden sat to Trump's left with eyes cast downward for much of the speech, while former Vice President Kamala Harris looked away from the podium during ovations. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who ran against Trump in 2016, appeared to laugh aloud as Trump announced his plans to rename the Gulf of Mexico.\nIn his speech, Trump took direct shots at the outgoing administration. With Biden and Harris seated behind him, the incoming president criticized Biden's handling of issues both domestic and abroad.\n\"We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad,\" Trump said. \"It fails to protect our magnificent law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.\"\nTrump rattled off a litany of other priorities such as raising tariffs and creating an External Revenue Service to collect them, recommitting to oil drilling, recognizing only two genders and dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and policies. Trump also said he would rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, rename Denali (a mountain in Alaska) to Mount McKinley after a former Republican president, retake the Panama Canal, make America \"color blind\" and plant the American flag on Mars.\nAs Trump spoke in the Capitol, some pro-Trump supporters, gathered in D.C., reflected Trump's combative attitude.\nOthers gathered in the nation's capital were less strident, though not any less enthused by the incoming administration; in fact, many traveled far from home to express their support.\nLona Franczak, who traveled from Dallas, Texas, said that the trip was worthwhile even with the ceremony being moved indoors.\n\"I'm excited for so much,\" Franczak said. \"I'm ready to see the (people imprisoned for their involvement in the Jan. 6 Capitol storming) get put out of prison. And I'm ready to see Joe Biden be put out of office, and I am ready to see the border walls restored. I could go on forever.\"\nOne Trump supporter traveled all the way from Ontario, Canada to witness the inauguration.\nDana Ogilvie, who hails from Kingston, Ontario, said that he would welcome the annexation of Canada by the United States, something that Trump has mentioned several times.\n\"I'd rather have God-given rights than government privileges,\" he said.\nJack Bowman, Emma Tufo and Paul Kiefer contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

American Legion auxiliaries partner with Operation We Care to support troops\n\n January 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 455\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n QUEENSTOWN — Members of the community and American Legion auxiliaries packed 70 boxes for service members deployed in Jordan and South Korea as part of Operation We Care, an Eastern Shore nonprofit, at the Queenstown American Legion on Jan. 18. The cooperative effort aims to bring troops overseas a taste of home.Filled to the brim, each box contained comforts of home with snacks, essentials, and toiletries as well as Valentine's Day cards crafted by local students.\nStarted in 2007, Jeff Merritt and his wife Diana of Salisbury knew there must be something they could do to assist the Easton Army National Guard units deployed to Iraq at that time.\n\"We had no money, no forward plan, and no idea what we were doing,\" he said.\nStarting with simple packages with thoughtful reminders of hope and well-wishes, the nonprofit has since taken off to regularly ship thousands of packages a year and collaborated with numerous team members and partnerships through the strength of community support, he said.\nMerritt presented kudos to the amazing team of Operation We Care and the wonderful partners who have thrown their hat in the ring in supporting the mission, including Fisher's Popcorn, of Ocean City, whose donations ensure kernels make it into every box.\nDuring the height of the pandemic, dedicated volunteers continued to package from home as Operation we Care also sent out thousands of packages to local hospitals, fire departments, and police stations to ensure support and voice appreciation to support first responders and let them know they are appreciated, Merritt said.\nOWC regularly hosts boxing days, including as recently as November in which volunteers packaged more than 1,000 boxes in two hours, Merritt said.\nThe nonprofit's largest expense is postage, spending about $40,000 a year, he said.\nEspecially for some unit members who wouldn't otherwise receive packages, receiving a box can truly mean the world to someone far from home.\n\"They serve as morale boosters,\" Merritt said.\nVolunteer Enid Kelley and her husband Josh have been part of the operation since 2013. Josh was originally a member of the Easton National Guard unit that received the inaugural packages 18 years ago. Josh credited Operation We Care as a worthwhile organization that brings the community together in supporting troops.\n\"Its great to pay it forward to future units now,\" he said.\n\"It means a lot to have been able to see the entire process first hand,\" Enid said.\nSons of the American Legion State Commander and Centreville Jeff Davis 18 Commander Jason Miller noted Operation We Care serves an imperative mission in reminding service members they are not forgotten and to thank them for everything they do.\n\"It's the little bit we can do to give back,\" he said.\nMore information can be found at Operation We Care can be found at https://www.operationwecare.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "World War II veteran celebrates 100th birthday\n\n January 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1226\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Private First Class Kernie Thompson's nickname was \"Young Boy\" when he served overseas in the U.S. Army's 599th Ordnance Ammunition Company during World War II.That's because Thompson, at age 18, was the youngest of the 40 soldiers assigned to that all-African-American unit when he joined in 1943, the start of a two-year stint in which fought alongside his comrades in England, France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.\nOn Wednesday (Jan. 15), that veteran once known as Young Boy celebrated his 100th birthday, a milestone marked by a party in the Community Living Center at the Perry Point VA Medical Center, where the Baltimore native has resided since 2020.\nThere were party hats, lots of balloons, a beautiful birthday cake and Thompson's favorite candy — Hershey's Kisses, which he calls \"silver bells.\" The party room was packed with people, including Thompson's fellow veteran residents, VA staff and members of his church family.\nAmong the party guests were Army officials, including Maj. General John Cushing, who is the Commanding General; and U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Command Sgt. Major Brian Haydt.\nThompson reportedly was his usual upbeat self during the party. Thompson relies on a wheelchair and is \"not able to eat regular by mouth,\" but he remains \"sharp as a tack\" mentally, one longtime friend described. The new Centenarian has outlived his children and his friends from childhood and young adulthood.\nAlso at the party was the woman Thompson married more than 40 years ago, Clarice Thompson, his second wife, whom he nicknamed \"Reesey.\" Thompson reportedly gets excited whenever he hears her name or learns that \"Reesey\" has come to visit him.\n\"He is the love of my life,\" Clarice said, before referencing his necessary VA residency and remarking, \"I miss him, but I know that he is where he is suppose to be.\"\nThompson is soft-spoken and is strong in his Christian faith, according to a few party attendees who were interviewed.\nHe served more than 40 years as the chaplain at the oldest African-American owned and operated nursing home in the state, Maryland Baptist Aged Home in Baltimore, where he volunteered once a week.\nA longtime member of a city Baptist Church, where he served as a deacon until age 94, Thompson also was active for more than 40 years in the Baptist Deacons Conference of Baltimore. In addition, Thompson provided usher, or deacon, training to parishioners throughout Maryland and other states, as part of an usher ministry associated with another one of the faith-based groups that he served.\n\"He's the kind of man who walks humbly and talks humbly. When he speaks, you listen,\" Clarice said. \"He's the kind of man I would recommend any young people to just take a photograph of him in their mind and take on some of his characteristics — other than Jesus' characteristics.\"\nClarice added, \"Not only was he disciplined in the military, he's a disciplined man as he walks with God.\"\nOne of the party attendees, Joseph Miller, president of that Baptist Deacons Conference of Baltimore, and his wife have been friends with Thompson and Clarice for more than 30 years.\n\"He is a wonderful guy. His smile is what gets you. He seems like a quiet person. His mannerism is quiet until you start talking to him. He's powerful. He talks softly, but carries a big stick,\" Miller commented with a chuckle. \"He loves to talk.\"\nAlong those lines, Thompson's favorite topic of discussion: The Bible.\n\"He loves the word of God, and he will share it with you. When I come here to the VA center and talk to the residents, they always tell me what he taught them about the word of God,\" Miller said.\nAfter retiring from his career as a Baltimore City maintenance worker, Thompson worked as an usher during Baltimore Orioles home games. He had that gig for three decades and was quite popular among spectators and all employees in the Baltimore Orioles organization.\n\"I was there when he got his 30-year ring, and he was proud of that (ring). They knew him well at the Baltimore Orioles, from the general manager, the manager, the players, the vendors, the mascot, and they all loved Kernie Thompson,\" Miller said.\nAn only child with an interest in woodworking, Thompson entered the U.S. Army at the tender age of 18 in 1943. Defending this country during World War II is among the many admirable contributions Thompson has made during his 100 years on this earth, thus far.\nThompson left his parents' West Baltimore home and traveled to Georgia, where he completed basic training. The military then sent Thompson to Camp Breckinridge in Kentucky, where he was put in the Army's 599th Ordnance Ammunition Company, which saw combat action after its deployment to Europe.\nDuring a Cecil Whig interview two years ago, Thompson recalled, \"Being overseas at war was a great experience, but some days were pleasant and some days were scary.\"\nThe following is an excerpt of some of the World War II remembrances Thompson shared during that interview:\nThompson noted that he enjoyed talking to not only his fellow soldiers, but citizens of the countries they were deployed to about their life and what it was like living in their country.\n\"They would ask about the United States and we would ask about their country and we would always talk to the people, we had a good relationship,\" Thompson said. \"With the soldiers, we would play cards and everyone always had something to say to make you laugh.\"\nBut when Thompson and his fellow soldiers weren't playing cards, telling jokes or talking with citizens, they were receiving ordnance shipments, supplying soldiers with ammunition and exercising their knowledge from basic training — something Thompson said his survival was contingent upon.\n\"What they teach you is important to your life, especially in combat,\" said Thompson. \"Your life might depend on what you were taught in basic training.\"\nThompson recalled that that training saved his life late one night in 1944, when his company was waiting for the arrival of a munitions shipment. After his group laid down to rest before the shipment arrived, they were awakened by the sight of enemy flares falling from the skies.\nAccording to Thompson, flares were used to illuminate areas at night so planes and infantry could properly identify enemy soldiers, weaponry and other valuable targets — such as the ammunition holds that Thompson's unit was responsible for.\n\"Basic training taught us that when they drop flares, don't move and turn your face to the ground,\" said Thompson. \"If you look up, the planes could see the glare of your face and it could mess up the dilation of your eyes. It was a scary night.\"\nIn 1945, after two years of his service, Thompson — who was then 21 — received word that the war was over.\n\"When we heard the war was over, it was a big joy,\" Thompson said. \"We shouted and we celebrated. When I got back, the first thing I did was go with my mother to see my grandmother and we had a nice dinner and celebrated.\"\nFollowing the war, Thompson got married, had a daughter and worked.\nReflecting on his wartime military service, Thompson commented, \"Being a part of the Army and serving my county was one of the most rewarding things because I felt like I was fulfilling a duty that I owed to my country and it makes me feel good,\"\nThompson then remarked, \"I am a blessed man to be here.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pardon of Jan. 6 rioters should not be overlooked\n\n January 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM BRUCE | Section: Columns \n \n 414\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n We must not allow President Trump's blizzard of executive orders to divert our attention from the body blow to the rule of law that Trump inflicted by pardoning all 1,500 convicted offenders who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Even Republicans expected, including Vice President Vance, a case-by-case evaluation to exclude violent offenders from the blanket pardon. That was apparently inconvenient for Trump's inauguration timetable, so he pardoned all.When reporters asked Republican senators how they felt about this unexpected blanket pardon, all but a couple mumbled and scurried to escape into nearby elevators. The Republican House majority leader defended the blanket pardons. For 90 years inscribed on the Supreme Court building are the words \"Equal Justice Under Law.\" Perhaps President Trump should by executive order change that to \"Loyalty Above Justice.\"\nTrump apologists respond with the usual \"what about\" Biden's selective pardoning of his family and several others, but those were not convicted violent offenders. We witnessed the lethal attack on the Capitol with our own eyes.\nTrump's followers scoff at historical comparisons with the rise of autocrats like Mussolini, but the blanket pardon of violent convicted criminals who attacked our Capitol seeking to block the lawful transfer of power is singular in our history. What is to prevent Trump from inciting his MAGA followers again to acts of violence against Trump's opponents and then pardoning them?\nEven now Trump supporters are threatening the Episcopal bishop for the Archdiocese of Washington for her prayer at the National Cathedral beseeching Trump to have mercy on the LGBTQ+ community and migrant workers who are in the United States illegally. Trump demanded an apology for her prayer. She refused.\nMussolini showed in 1922 how immunized violence can dismantle democracies. He called for a March on Rome, the capital, by his Black Shirts who committed crimes such as assaults, murders and voter intimidation, which were then pardoned or ignored by the judicial system. The emboldened Black Shirts helped enable Mussolini seize power and establish a fascist government. In Trump's case, we should not fool ourselves — in democracies, elections do not excuse or immunize political violence as substitute for the ballot box.\nPolls show Americans voted for Trump mainly out of concern for inflation, the economy and the border. Voters did not condone the radical idea that a violent mob can mount an attack on the Capitol and on police officers to thwart the results of the ballot box and then receive wholesale pardon by the president when he incited it. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Immigration reform starts with Laken Riley bill\n\n January 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 792\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu said: \"A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.\"On the issue of American border security and immigration laws reform, that journey may be close to starting that single step with enactment of the Laken Riley bill in Congress.\nRiley, a University of Georgia student, was murdered last February while jogging on the university campus.\nHer convicted murderer had been detained three times since arriving illegally in the United States, but the U.S. Border Patrol and police in New York and Georgia released him from custody each time.\nRiley's murder as well as the circumstances surrounding it generated widespread national and international media coverage. That coverage led to intense and sustained public outrage.\nAs a result, last March the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Laken Riley bill allowing federal detention of illegal immigrants arrested for committing certain crimes in the United States.\nBased on opposition from then Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the House passed bill was never brought up for a vote in the Senate.\nCountless Americans viewed this lack of action as more affirmation that federal immigration policies and procedures needed major changes. Many Americans also concluded major changes were needed with border security and immigration policy makers in Washington, D.C.\nSensing that way of thinking, then Presidential candidate Donald Trump and Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate and the U.S House of Representatives branded themselves as change artists. They did so in two ways.\nThey effectively utilized the communications and messaging counsel of Frank Luntz:\n\"The key to successful communication is to take the imaginative leap of stuffing yourself into your listener's shoes to know what they are thinking and feeling in the deepest recesses of their mind and heart. Get your audience to visualize … imagine. Only when people can see a better future will they consider a change.\"\nThey also effectively utilized the communications and messaging counsel of Adam Grant:\n\"It's better to over communicate and sound redundant than to under-communicate and seem unclear and uncaring. It turns out that repeating yourself is vital to effective communication. Psychologists have long demonstrated that with repeated exposure to ideas, we start to like them more. The greatest barrier to communication is the illusion that it occurred. Reinforcing a message makes it more familiar and more memorable.\"\nDonald Trump and Republican candidates did that and did it exceptionally well.\nAs a result, Donald Trump achieved the greatest political comeback in American history. Trump's coattails helped elect Republican majorities in the House and the Senate.\nTrump and the Republican Congressional leadership know they have to move quickly to demonstrate to the public that they are taking measurable steps to deliver on a better future.\nThe first step was to re-introduce another Laken Riley bill in the House this year and make it the first policy vote of the 119th Congress.\nIt is working so far.\nThe reintroduced Laken Riley bill was approved in the House with the support of all the Republican House members and 48 of the Democratic House members.\nUnlike last year, the House bill moved quickly through the Senate and passed with bipartisan support.\nDemocratic Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) said, \"I support giving authorities the tools to prevent tragedies like this one while we work on comprehensive solutions to our broken system.\"\nDemocratic Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said, \"We must give law enforcement the means to take action when illegal immigrants break the law, to prevent situations like what occurred to Laken Riley. I will continue to fight for the safety of Arizonans by pushing for comprehensive immigration reform and increased border security.\"\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) said, \"I support this effort because federal authorities need to protect our communities from criminals. Keeping Arizonans safe is my top priority and I'm committed to working with Republicans and Democrats on solutions to secure our border and fix our broken immigration system.\"\nDemocratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said, \"While I do not support this particular bill, I stand ready to work with both sides to pass smart, effective, tough and commonsense legislation to secure our borders and reform our immigration system.\"\nIt is almost certain the bill will be signed into law by President Trump very soon, if he has not done so already but after this commentary is being written.\nWhile there is still no consensus on the details, bipartisan support going forward for further legislation indicates that a growing number of Democratic members of Congress are accepting the clear messages from voters in the 2024 election cycle.\nThere is no question a wide range of different opinions between Republicans and Democratic lawmakers on exactly how best to proceed are far from resolved.\nThat said we can hope the enactment of the Laken Riley Law will be the first step on a long bi-partisan journey to achieve meaningful border security and immigration reform. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "The real question in Gaza — what comes next?",
    "date": "2025-02-01",
    "author": "MEL GURTOV",
    "content": "The real question in Gaza — what comes next?\n\n February 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MEL GURTOV | Section: Columns \n \n 907\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Israel-Hamas ceasefire has brought a measure of relief to Israelis and Palestinians. But everyone recognizes that what comes next is the real question —next, that is, assuming the prisoner-hostage exchanges proceed as agreed upon. That is a big assumption.Will the ceasefire last? Will Gaza be free of Israeli occupation forces? There are plenty of reasons for concern, including the following:\nThe exchange of prisoners for hostages may bog down over numbers, especially on the Palestinian side. As many as 10,000 prisoners are being held in Israeli Defense Forces detention centers as well as other prisons. Many prisoners have never been charged or sentenced, including children. How many prisoners there actually are, where they are, and whether Israel will release them are potential stumbling blocks.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is only fully behind Stage 1 of the deal — a ceasefire and an initial prisoner-for-hostage exchange. Stage 2 calls for a permanent cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. But, according to Yossi Fuchs, Netanyahu's chief of staff, the deal: \"includes the option to resume the fighting at the end of phase 1 if the negotiations over phase 2 don't develop in a manner that promises the fulfillment of the war's goals: military and civil annihilation of Hamas and a release of all hostages.\" Let's recall that Netanyahu has never committed to anything short of total victory over Hamas.\nEven if agreement is reached on Stage 2, the devil will be in the details. Ivo Daalder, a former US foreign affairs official, writes: \"Who will govern the territory? Who will pay for rebuilding a landscape reduced to rubble? Who will feed the people, house them, put them through school, get them jobs, treat their diseases, wounds, and emotional traumas? and criminals praying on the vulnerable and weak?\"\nGoverning Gaza could be the source of another conflict, this one between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas. Although Hamas has been seriously weakened, its cells still command authority and will probably reject a Palestinian Authority attempt to govern. One Middle East expert group writes: \"PA President Mahmoud Abbas's office stated on January 17 that the PA holds legal and political jurisdiction over the Gaza Strip as the recognized governing authority of the Palestinian territories and is prepared to deploy administrative and security teams to the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire agreement does not task the PA with governing the Strip, nor does the ceasefire discuss post-war governance in any capacity. PA Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa separately stated on January 18 that the PA has a 'hundred-day plan' for after the ceasefire goes into effect.\" Left out of this commentary is Netanyahu's longstanding opposition to PA rule in Gaza.\nHamas, in fact, has been rebuilding its numbers even as its organizational strength has been seriously weakened. U.S. intel just now is reporting that Hamas has recruited around 15,000 people even as it is said to have lost 20,000 fighters. Israel has frequently said Hamas must not be allowed to rise again. That goal would seem to be unrealizable.\nIsrael's efforts to redraw the lines in the West Bank, southern Lebanon, and Syria are not addressed in the agreement. The far right will be insistent that the IDF not withdraw from any of those occupied lands for security reasons. If the IDF remains there, we are bound to see more violence — from Hezbollah, Syrian militia and Israeli settlers. Hezbollah is demanding that the IDF complete its withdrawal from Lebanon in accordance with their 60-day ceasefire agreement last November. That agreement has now expired. The IDF is saying it will not meet the deadline.\nOngoing violence in the West Bank, mainly by rampaging settlers and with support from Netanyahu's far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich, could undo progress in the Gaza negotiations. Israel's far right is strongly against the ceasefire and is surely looking for ways to sabotage it. The New York Times reported January 21 that in the West Bank, \"settlers rampaged through several villages ... torching homes and businesses and vandalizing vehicles ... \" One Israeli human rights group called the attacks \"pogroms\" intended to sabotage the ceasefire agreement. In fact, settler violence has been going on for months.\nIn short, the ceasefire deal may amount to no more than Stage 1, leaving the IDF still deployed in Gaza as well as in southern Lebanon, Hamas still actively recruiting, and the Palestinian population unable to resume their lives with any semblance of security and well-being.\nWhere is the Trump administration in all this? It will support continued Israeli occupation, repression of the Palestinian population, obstruction of Palestinian self-government, and support of Netanyahu should he decide to resume the war with Hamas. To Trump, Gaza is \"a demolition site,\" so \"we just clean out that whole thing.\" He has asked Egypt (headed by one of his favorite autocrats) and Jordan to take in more Palestinians—presumably, those who survive the cleaning-out process.\nTrump's appointment of ardently (indeed, religiously) pro-Israel ambassadors to the UN and Tel Aviv, his voiding of Biden's sanctions on violent settlers, his order to the Pentagon to release 2,000-pound bombs for delivery to Israel and his exemption of Israel from a decision to halt all foreign aid all make clear that a just, peace-promoting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is impossible under this administration.\nTo the contrary, Trump supports ethnic cleansing in Gaza and any other Israeli action that takes the Middle East off his agenda. The human toll means nothing to him. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Order attempted to circumvent U.S. Constitution\n\n February 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM BRUCE | Section: Columns \n \n 465\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n All hail King Trump!His freezing on spending appropriated funds on a wide swath of programs without first getting approval from Congress is hardly a new idea. Nixon tried to use this approach on programs he disfavored. Congress responded with the Budget Impoundment Act of 1974 that describes the process for the president gaining approval from Congress to delay spending or not spend Congressionally appropriated funds.\nBy law, without that approval, the funds must be spent. Trump 's executive order usurps not just this law, but if upheld in the courts, the Constitution's placement of the power of the purse in the legislature, not the president.\nDon't dismiss this as just more of Trump's chaos.\nIt is a deliberate sequence of unlawful actions in Trump's plan to radically transform the U.S. One of the key functions of the inspectors general in federal agencies is to independently investigate agency compliance with the Impoundment Act, and to expose illegal impoundments and recissions of appropriated funds.\nTrump fired more than a dozen of these inspectors general last week without first giving Congress the required 30-day notice. If the president had given timely notice, then these inspectors general would still be in office and might have declared that the president's executive order freezing spending is an illegal impoundment.\nDon't think this is just theoretical Washington-speak and remote from our daily lives. The freeze appears to affect federal grants and loans to the state of Maryland and its counties, including Talbot, for education, health care research, potentially Medicaid and disaster assistance.\nWhat Trump brings to this process is first, the novel and absurd idea that mere presidential executive orders can override laws of the United States, including the Budget Impoundment Act.\nSecond, unlike other presidents, his oath to the Constitution is no restraint on him ordering radical revisions in our government to fit his vision. We can expect him and his apologists to say, oh, but this is temporary. Trump is probably counting on legal challenges to his unlawful executive order causing many months of delay. He also has a longshot hope that the Supreme Court will overturn decades of settled law on the Constitutional separation of powers between the president and Congress as to the power of the purse.\nTo solidify his power as the supreme leader in the early 1930s in Germany, Adolph Hitler was careful to secure from the legislature (Reichstag) control over spending. If Trump succeeds in securing power over our federal spending, then he gains not just a legal victory but a crown.\nPostscript: Just after submittal of this piece to the paper, the Trump White House, facing a federal court 's order to stay execution of the executive order for a week, and widespread confusion as to the effects of the order, rescinded it altogether. The president blamed the media for the confusion. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Nothing more difficult than taking lead on change\n\n February 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 771\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Well before and since his swearing in on Jan. 20, President Trump has been moving aggressively to secure Senate approval of a team of cabinet and sub-cabinet members to implement his Make America Great Again agenda.To date he has achieved significant, but not yet universal, success on those approvals.\nAs I write this there are at least three of his nominations where final Senate approval is increasingly likely but not certain.\nThey are are Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services, Kash Patel for FBI director, and Tulsi Gabbard for national intelligence director.\nEarlier last month Trump's nomination of Pete Hegseth to serve as secretary of Defense was approved in the Senate by the narrowest of margins.\nFollowing contentious committee hearings on his background and competence, Hegseth was confirmed only after Vice President JD Vance broke a 50-50 tie vote with a \"yes\" vote for him.\nIf any of the pending Trump nominations fail to receive full Senate approval it will be the first time since 1925 when a Republican controlled Senate rejected a Republican president's cabinet nomination. The president then was Calvin Coolidge and the failed nominee was Charles Warren for attorney general.\nTrump's immediate Democratic predecessors — Barack Obama and Joe Biden had all their cabinet nominations approved by the Senate. In both cases there were Democratic majorities in the Senate and some of their more controversial nominations were withdrawn from consideration before full Senate consideration of their nominations.\nThe reasons for resistance to Trump are not surprising.\nOver 500 years ago political observer and philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli wrote the following timeless observation on change:\n\"It must be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.\"\nIn 2024 Trump ran and won on a change platform and his commitment to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things in Washington.\nThat is similar to the goal that former President Obama expressed when he first ran for the presidency.\nEarly and often on the campaign trail Obama said, \"Washington is broken. My whole campaign has been premised from the start on the idea that we have to fundamentally change how Washington works.\"\nAfter the election to his first term, Obama said with confidence that he had not miscalculated how difficult it would be to change Washington.\nHe said, \"I didn't overpromise. And I didn't underestimate how tough this was gonna be.\"\nAfter four years in office and his election to a second term Obama acknowledged with a combination of frustration, regret and self-reflection, that he had in fact miscalculated and underestimated how hard making changes was going to be.\nHe said \"I'm the first one to confess that the spirit that I brought to Washington, that I wanted to see instituted, where we weren't constantly in a political slugfest … I haven't fully accomplished that. Haven't even come close in some instances. And, you know, if you ask me what's my biggest disappointment [it] is that we haven't changed the tone in Washington as much as I would have liked.\"\nTime will tell if Donald Trump acknowledges and says much the same thing after the end of his second term.\nThe first test of success or failure for Trump will occur in less than two years.\nIn November 2026, all the seats in the House of Representatives and one third of the seats in the Senate will be up for election.\nHistorically, but not always, these elections are largely a referendum on a president's performance and agenda.\nIf the Republicans do lose control of the House or the Senate in 2026, any unapproved elements of Trump's MAGA agenda will likely be stalled, if not stopped completely.\nConversely, if that does not occur, the odds for success for Trump in continuing to advance his MAGA agenda are greatly increased.\nIt also increases the odds for Vice President Vance securing the Republican nomination for and winning the election as president in 2028.\nGoing forward, only one thing is certain.\nEither way, we will soon be better able to affirm or challenge the thinking that in the political world, pursuing real change is often an exercise in futility, no matter who is elected president. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is unconstitutional, illegal, cruel and endangers our national security. Republicans in Congress have broken the promise, the oath they each took to \"protect and defend\" the Constitution of the United States.The threats to the FBI have nothing to do with \"improving the quality and efficiency of government.\" Opening the Treasury to unvetted civilians has nothing to do with fiscal responsibility. Muzzling the CDC and defunding NIH have nothing to do with protecting the health of your constituents.\nAbolishing the Department of Education does nothing to improve the preparation of our young people to compete in the world. Putting Bibles in classrooms won't make us more Christ-like, in the best sense of that word.\nRounding up hundreds of people and putting them in \"camps\" has a familiar, historical and shameful ring to it. Taking Martin Luther King out of the curriculum won't change civil rights history.\nDeclaring there is only male and female won't make it so. Taking Gen. Milley's portrait off the wall of the Pentagon is pitifully pathetic and yet won't erase the contribution he's made to the country throughout his military career.\nThis administration is opening the door to the most dangerous time in our history and Republicans are aiding and abetting that threat.\nPlease don't tell me, Mr. Andy Harris, that it's the \"honor of your lifetime\" to be representing me. You don't. I do expect that you and your party will begin to do your job of providing a check on the Musk/Trump power play.\nJUDY FAUNTLEROY\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And Hitler at the Reichstag, yet. What about Napoleon on the 18 Brumaire at Saint-Cloud in 1799? Oh, wait, Trump never conquered Europe nor invaded Russia like Napoleon, leading to the deaths of 6.5 million people.\nWhat about Stalin at the 12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party in April 1923 in Moscow? Oh, that won't work either, since Stalin has been blamed for the deaths of 10 million people, maybe more, they don't know for sure. What about Mao at Tian'anmen on October 1, 1949? Oh no, because they now think that Mao and his policies may be responsible for 80 million fatalities; no one knows the exact amount.\nThe only similar number of deaths that we have had in America since Trump first won the 2016 election is the number of babies aborted, which is in the millions. But they don't count, do they? Plus abortion is not Trump's fault, although if Democrats did not love abortion they would find a way to blame him for it, as they do other things.\nSo please stop comparing Trump to a mass murderer like Hitler. It does not insult Trump because it is so absurd, but it does diminish the real victims of the real Nazis, whose bodies are still being recovered in mass graves throughout Eastern Europe.\nAs for the complaint about Trump's executive orders, what about all the executive orders given by Obama and Biden? So Democrat presidents can issue executive orders but when Trump does it somehow the Constitution is being violated? I say to all Democrats, especially to Gov. Wes Moore and his lament over the \"chaos\" in Washington (Star Democrat, Feb. 5), please focus on fixing the chaos your policies have caused in our schools and in our cities, where too often violence reigns.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Anti-abortion groups want Musk, Trump to ‘defund’ Planned Parenthood\n\n February 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: National \n \n 1123\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Anti-abortion activists want Elon Musk to look at eliminating federal funding for Planned Parenthood as part of his austerity measures for President Donald Trump.Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts have resulted in staffing and operational cuts across multiple U.S. agencies and turned off funding to various contractors and other groups who receive federal money.\nAnti-abortion groups want Musk and President Donald Trump, who believes abortion rights should be left up to individual U.S. states, to look into an turn off funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider which also offers other health services.\nFederal funding cannot be used for abortion services. Planned Parenthood receives federal money for Medicaid reimbursements for other health services as well federal grants for health centers and non-abortion programs.\n'ELIMINATE'Public money for Planned Parenthood has long been targeted by conservative groups opposed to abortion rights. Such an effort with Musk would draw his DOGE efforts into the long divisive abortion rights debate.\n\"Planned Parenthood's total revenue for 2023 (the latest year numbers are available) was over $2 billion. Yet, Planned Parenthood received over $699.3 million in taxpayer funds from various government 'reimbursements and grants.' Taxpayers should not be supplementing an industry that takes the lives of pre-born children and brings in over $2 billion in revenue. We are hopeful that the Trump administration will look into the taxpayer money used to supplement the nation's largest abortion provider and eliminate the funding scheme,\" said Laura Echevarria, National Right to Life's director of communications and press secretary.\nA contingent of anti-abortion and socially conservative advocates have written to Musk as well as the Office of Management and Budget asking them to examine Planned Parenthood's federal funding.\n\"According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Planned Parenthood Health Centers received about $22 billion in Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grants and $53 billion in payments from public health coverage programs from 2019 to 2021. Planned Parenthood Federation of America affiliates received $148 million in HHS grants and $1.5 billion in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payments, with an additional $108 million or so for Planned Parenthood's regional organizations,\" reads the Feb. 13 letter.\nIt was spearheaded by former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's Advancing American Freedom group. Signators include AAF President Tim Chapman, Faith & Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed and Jennie Bradley Lichter, president of March for Life Action.\nThe Southern Baptist Convention, CatholicVote, Oregon Right to Life and other groups are also asking abortion rights opponents to contact Trump and Congress asking them to restrict Planned Parenthood funding.\nORTL Executive Director Lois Anderson said in an email to supporters that Planned Parenthood provides 40% of the abortions in the U.S.\nA NEW 'DEFUND FIGHT'In a Feb. 3 memo, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America outlined the impact yanked government funding could have on its operations and patients.\n\"If patients are prevented from getting quality, affordable Planned Parenthood health services like birth control, cancer screenings, and STI (sexually transmitted infections) testing and treatment, and more, the grave consequences would bring lasting harm to communities nationwide. Many patients who come to Planned Parenthood health centers get their insurance through Medicaid, and have few care options — as many Planned Parenthood health centers are located in health provider deserts, making it hard to access any health care,\" PPFA said in the memo.\nPlanned Parenthood said it had more than 2 million patients nationwide in 2022, conducted close to 213,000 breast exams, approximately 198,000 pap tests and 2.3 million birth control services.\nMore than half of Planned Parenthood 's patients are lower income and on Medicaid. Close to half of Planned Parenthood's patients are people of color, according to the group.\nMusk and Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy brought up potential Planned Parenthood defunding after Trump's election win. Musk has since taken control of DOGE efforts with job cuts across the U.S. government. Musk said last year he does not support abortion rights after viability.\nAlexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said after that pronouncement such an action would deny people health care and wreak \"havoc on our public health system.\"\n\"We've been here before — we are not new to shutdown and 'defund' fights. We fended off a number of these attacks during Trump's first term — and Planned Parenthood health centers are still there serving millions of patients across the nation.\" McGill Johnson said.\nAfter the 2022 Dobbs' decision overturning Roe v. Wade, abortion rights were sent back to the states.\nSome conservative states, such as Utah, Alabama and Florida, have sought to restrict abortion rights post-Roe.\nVoters in other states, such as Montana, Missouri, Maryland, New York, Nevada and Arizona — approved ballot measures in November enshrining abortion rights into their state constitutions.\nAll of those states, except New York, went for Trump in the November presidential race over Vice President Kamala Harris, who made expansive abortion rights a centerpiece of her White House bid.\nTrump favors a state-by-state approach to abortion and does not appear interested in a federal abortion ban or restriction on abortion-inducing medications.\nMedication abortions make up 63% of all pregnancy terminations in the U.S., according to the Guttmacher Institute.\nTrump has restricted U.S. funding internationally for groups providing abortions.\nThere are also GOP bills in Congress to defund Planned Parenthood.\nPROTESTS OR DIVIDENDSProgressives and other left-wing activists held protests on President's Day, Feb. 17. to rally against Trump's early days in office, his ties to wealthy interests including billionaires and oil and gas companies as well as Musk's DOGE austerity efforts.\n\"While Trump appoints 13 billionaires to his cabinet and Musk, Bezos and Zuckerberg see their wealth increase by $217 billion since the election, 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, 25% of seniors live on $15,000 or less and millions cannot afford rent,\" said U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, referring to Meta/Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk, who heads Tesla, X and Starlink.\n\"Say no to oligarchy,\" Sanders said.\nMusk and Trump have pressed forward with their DOGE efforts highlighting U.S. tax dollars going to foreign aid projects and Social Security databases showing people with age well into their 100s and even 200s and 300s.\nOn Wednesday, Trump read aloud U.S. spending projects in countries such as Uganda, Moldova, Peru and Serbia and the number of people with lofty ages in the Social Security system database.\n\"200 to 209 years old: 879 people. 210 to 219 years old: 866 people. 220 to 229 years old: 1,039 people. 240 to 249 years old: 2 people. 1 person that is 360 years old,\" said Trump, adding that DOGE efforts will see if any benefits are being paid out to those accounts.\nTrump and Musk also talked up sending $5,000 'DOGE dividends' to Americans from the savings he is finding in government spending. The checks could also entail sending 20% of DOGE austerity savings to Americans. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Thanks to Trump and DOGE millions upon millions of wasted dollars were revealed spent on such items as $1.5 million for advancing diversity in Serbia, $32,000 for transgender comic books in Peru, $47,000 for a transgender opera in Columbia, just to mention a few.\nI would guess some of that money would be real helpful for homeless vets, but Biden didn't appreciate our veterans.

She objected to my implying a comparison between President Trump and Hitler, a mass murderer.I did not cite Hitler for how many people he killed. Instead, I described how Hitler carefully took control from the German legislature of spending authority in his rise to power. (My op-ed explained how Trump is attempting to take spending authority away from Congress.) See \"How Hitler Dismantled a Democracy in 53 Days,\" by Timothy W. Riback, in the latest issue of the Atlantic.\nI appreciate Russell's suggestion of comparing Trump to Napoleon. Trump loves strong men like Napoleon, who declared himself emperor of France in 1804. In fact, Trump himself quoted Napoleon on Feb. 16, \"He who saves his country does not violate any law,\" a shocking statement coming from the president of a Constitutional democracy.\nJIM BRUCE\nSt. Michaels \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "An appalling display of America in retreat\n\n March 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MEL GURTOV | Section: Columns \n \n 956\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Imagine that during World War II, at the height of Nazi Germany's blitz of Britain, President Roosevelt invited Prime Minister Winston Churchill to Washington and humiliated him with derisive comments about Britain's looming defeat and failure to thank the President for U.S. support. Unthinkable, of course, but that's exactly what happened when Ukraine's President Volodymir Zelensky visited Washington and had to endure Donald Trump's appalling interrogation.Saturday's headlines spoke of a \"collision\" and a \"blowup\" between the two leaders, but it was far more than that. It marked an historic American retreat from Europe and from international responsibility.\nBut before that drama played out, there were visits to Washington by the French and British leaders. Neither received any indication that the U.S. might backstop a NATO presence in Ukraine should Ukraine and Russia reach agreement to end their war.\nFrance's Emmanuel Macron was forthright in insisting that \"peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine\" or \"a ceasefire without guarantees.\" Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer tried to stroke Trump's ego and fared better, bringing an invitation to visit from King Charles and getting Trump to consider not increasing tariffs on Britain.\nWhether by design or circumstance, the Trump-Zelensky meeting was a setup for failure. The planned signing ceremony for a one-sided minerals deal descended into an argument, almost a shouting match, something never before seen in the Oval Office and captured on live TV.\nIt began with JD Vance's assertion that diplomacy was the path to peace. Zelensky challenged that, noting how untrustworthy Putin has been in the past when agreements were signed. That led to a heated exchange during which both Vance and Trump told Zelensky he was being disrespectful of the Oval Office and had not said \"thank you\" to the U.S. (Actually, CNN counted 33 times that Zelensky has thanked the U.S. for its support.)\nTrump told Zelensky, 'You're not really in a good position, you don't have the cards right now, you're gambling with World War III.\"\n\"You're either going to make a deal or we're out,\" Trump threatened. \"And if we're out, you'll fight it out, and I don't think it's going to be pretty.\"\nAFTERMATH\nAfter Zelensky left the meeting, Trump said it was \"meaningful\" but that Zelensky \"is not ready for peace. He can come back when he is ready for peace.\"\nWell, ready for a just peace, not peace at any price. A joint news conference planned for after the meeting was cancelled.\nWhile Trump and Vance will never waver in believing that Zelensky was ungrateful and should have kowtowed to the president, theirs was a disgraceful performance. The leader of a country that has endured three years of bombardment, enormous losses of life and economy, and Putin's war crimes should not be treated as a supplicant.\nFor Trump to remind Zelensky of the weakness of his position (\"I know,\" said Ukraine's president) and then to expect him to accept terms imposed by the U.S. and Russia is entirely unacceptable — and another example of Trumpian appeasement. After the meeting, Zelensky said on Fox News that he regretted the angry exchange but would not apologize, saying he wanted Trump \"to be more at our side.\"\nFor now, the minerals deal is off the table. It should be, since not only is it far too favorable to the U.S.; it also turns out to be far more complicated than initially presented. For one thing, Ukraine's supposed wealth in rare earths and other valuable minerals may be considerably exaggerated.\nSome experts say that at best, the reserves remain to be determined, and the costs of extraction could be monumental. Moreover, some mines are in Russian-controlled territory. The Russians have apparently offered a deal for U.S. ownership. That would mean U.S. mining in occupied land, another heavy blow to Ukrainian sovereignty.\nIn Trump's view, the minerals deal is supposed to substitute for a military commitment to Ukraine's security. The idea is that the Russians would not dare attack knowing that U.S. contractors were busy mining for Ukraine's lithium. But that's hardly a security commitment; rather, it's an excuse for non-involvement.\nAt his first cabinet meeting, Trump said \"I'm not going to provide security guarantees beyond very much. We're going to have Europe do that.\"\nIn short, Ukraine cannot count on the U.S. to backstop Europe — an enormous policy shift that leaves any Ukraine-Russia peace agreement likely to fail.\nAMERICA IN RETREAT\nNearly every European leader rallied behind Zelensky. All issued statements in support of him, in direct contrast with fulsome Republican support of Trump. A senior Ukrainian official said Zelenskyy spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and President of the European Council Antonio Costa after he left the White House, describing all the conversations as \"supportive\" of the Ukrainian leader.\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, told Zelensky: \"Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President.\"\nGermany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz said his country would always support Ukraine. \"We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.\"\nOnly Hungary's Viktor Orban and the former Russian president Dmitri Medvedev took Trump's side — in itself an indication of where things stand these days, which is that the U.S. enjoys good relations with Russia, Iran, Belarus, Israel, Saudi Arabia ... and just about nobody else.\nDonald Trump evidently wants to return world politics to spheres of influence, with the U.S. in control of the Americas, China predominant in Asia and Russia the principal power in Europe. With U.S.-Russia relations moving toward normalcy, and Israel in the driver's seat in the Middle East, all it takes to realize Trump's vision is for China to bend to Trump on trade.\nPrinciples, values and commitments are out the window; pure self-interest in a world run by autocrats is all that matters. What can possibly go wrong? \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Jobs and careers are being destroyed, for the simple reason that they can, not that they are needed.\nWith the perception of cost saving, a maniacal person with too much money and no compassion, is chain-sawing the careers of civil servants while his own company rakes in billions to play catch with rockets.\nMeanwhile, wildfires rage on either coast, snow piles up in Gulf Coast states, and tornados run wild in the winter. But human influence on modifying the climate has never occurred. That is why it is OK to gut our national treasures and \"drill, baby, drill!\"\nAlso, an alliance with a leader who is fighting against an evil leader that has been theatrically destroyed by the \"good\" leader because, obviously, the evil leader told him he needed to do it.\nAfter all, like a child with its hand caught in the cookie jar, the evil leader swears he has never done anything wrong. I am sure it has nothing to do with mineral rights that will benefit the previously described maniacal person.\nSeemingly ignored, is the fact that 1,500 individuals that executed violence against law enforcement officers, causing injury and death, and trespassed on federal property that have been forgiven. Did they just say, \"My bad?\"\nCivil discourse has evaporated and elected officials are more interested in keeping their jobs versus standing up for what is right and truthful. Some, even repeat mistruths. It would be interesting to see these \"brave\" leaders enter the work force and leave their privileged lives behind.\nGood leaders know that if they walk in the room and think they are the smartest in the room, they need to find another room. Good leaders know that they need people to disagree to find proper solutions. Good leaders know that leading is not a title, but a privilege that is earned.\nHistory has taught us that good leaders outshine dictators every time. History has also taught us good leaders practice compassion for those that follow (that could be from reading the Bible right side up). History has also taught us that when the emperor has no clothes, it is not a pretty sight.\nTIM ALAND\nStevensville \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The goal of Vet Mentor AI is to ensure that every veteran has access to the support they deserve, making the complex claims process more accessible and effective.\nThe process which previously could take months if not years of organizing paper work now can be available in a manner of seconds, he said.\nOffering personalized seamless support to simplify complex processes for user ease, humanistic AI avatar guides include a Denied Claims Assistant, a Virtual Veterans Officer and a Compensation and Pension Exam Simulation.\nThe program will be able to scour the internet to provide concise and specific aspects needed for a specific claim.\nThe program is specifically designed to streamline the process, officials will be able to get answers to questions much faster and even tell the strength of a claim.\nIn addition to detecting human error made to denied claims, the program will make significant headway in eradicating \"claim sharks\" or non-VA-accredited affiliations that try to charge for phony filing assistance, he said.\nVAMSA officials were over the moon for the opportunity to bring the program to the community and expand their services by performing at a much higher level efficiency rate, according to Eric Johnson, VAMSA executive director and Air Force veteran.\nThe Eastern Shore has fewer resources compared to western shore counterparts, according to Johnson.\nWhether appealing denied decisions or establishing new claims, VAMSA spends the most amount of its time on claims, according to Johnson, who was sold \"immediately\" withVet MentorAI and noted a \"minimum\" of 75% staffing time will be cut through through the program.\n\"Eastern Shore residents often feel the overall resource availability is like a resource desert when compared with what is available on the Western Shore — VAMSA [alongside County partners] are working very hard to counter this perception,\" Johnson said.\nWith the workload saving, Johnson said, they will be able to expand service reaches, expand the organization's services and mission to address inequity faced by veterans and their families across the Eastern Shore.\nVAMSA has been asked to be the face of the organization's expanding mission and inequity faced by veterans and families on the Eastern Shore.\n\"I can't say enough about the capabilities,\" Johnson said.\nWith the streamlined services, VAMSA will be able to do more of what it is meant to do:spending time with clients and further strengthening service resources across the Mid-Shore region.\nSafety and support is a crucial aspect of the program and VAMSA access support will be available through every step of their claim's journey, according to Johnson.\nThe program is versatile and whether for those computer savvy or those who are not, clients will never be left on their own to navigate the technology.\nVAMSA officials can help walk applicants through the process, or applicants can use the program from the comfort of their own home, Johnson said.\n\"At the end of the day it's going to give us valuable information and we're still going to deliberately go through it and add the human touch,\" he said.\nThe tool will scrub the internet for research and academic sources studies to support service based conditions in a timely manner that even the most diligent VSO can't accomplish.\n\"It's taken people years to get answers, and this, it's literally taken seconds,\" Chad Baker, VAMSA board member and Army veteran said.\nThe program can tell the applicant what aspects are still needed and probably most importantly, The HIPAA certified program will never store or send out personal information and perhaps most importantly, Vet Mentor AI will never under any circumstances make up information it does not know the answer to, Hylenski emphasized.\n\"This is setting veterans up for success,\" said VAMSA board member and Navy veteran Cynthia Arnette. As a member of the Department of Veterans Affairs assisting veterans and their families get benefits for decades, Arnette could remember the old school filing days of pen and paper.\n\"Now look how far we've come,\" she said proudly.\nLike many, Arnette was wary of the growing rise of AI, but was \"elated\" at the prospects of VetMentor AI to assist claims and streamline the service.\nThe program will not be replacing Veteran Service Organizations, \"but strengthening them,\" according to Baker, who noted support for veterans assistance is a crucial need in the country. Decisions are made everyday that not only affect veterans, but the livelihood of spouses.\nBaker looked forward to the program eventually being utilized across the country and assisting long time coming support, especially Vietnam vets and their families and eliminating millions of dollars in backlog from human error.\n\"I really believe by using this tool, it puts something in the hands of the VA (Veterans Assistance) that they can act on exponentially more quickly, \" Johnson said, adding somberly, \"People literally die waiting for their claim.\"\nTransforming the lives of veterans one claim at a time, \"You are the reason I credited this tool, \" Hylenski said to the members of VAMSA, noting their passion in assisting veterans was nothing less than inspirational.\n\"This is going to change the world,\" he said.\nVAMSA will never lose sight of its human touch in assisting local veterans and coupling the advanced AI with its team of dedicated expertise to make advancements for those who have more than earned it.\n\"As long as there is a human element on both ends checking and validating, that's how you do artificial intelligence,\" Johnson said.\nThe VAMSA office is located at 301 Pier One Road Stevensville.\nMore information about VAMSA, including events for veterans can be found a.\nMore information about Vet Mentor AI can be found at https://www.vetmentorai.com.\nThis story has been updated to correct a quote by Eric Johnson referring to availability of resources and resource deserts. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "We have abdicated fairness, defending those in need\n\n March 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LARRY PIFER | Section: Columns \n \n 598\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Everything in our heritage, culture, and founding documents celebrates democracy. Article I of the Maryland Constitution proclaims, \"That all Government of right originates from the People.\" The motto of our neighboring state of Virginia is more pointed, \"Death to tyrants.\" However, under Trump our nation seems to have abandoned our position of leadership of democracies in the world, a position we spilled our blood and treasure to win and maintain. With no explanation, discussion, hearings or debate.We now side with Russia, our enemy for decades, a country that threatened to defeat and erase us from the earth. Russia has the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons because they stole the plans for the atomic bomb from us after World War II. They are not hesitant to rattle that saber. On Feb. 24, we voted twice in the United Nations to side with Russia to block a vote to condemn Russia for their unprovoked attack on Ukraine.\nRussia was the aggressor, we all saw it happen.\nWhy have we done this? The only possible explanation is that the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump wants to endear himself to the dictator of Russia Vladimir Putin and now sees himself and our country as beginning a friendship with our sworn enemy Russia. What is this all about? Putin wants to gain Ukrainian territory, then he may march into Europe and attempt to dominate some portion of Europe, probably Poland. Certainly, our NATO allies and I fear the United States will not resist because Donald Trump is now Putin's friend. Putin certainly does not see himself as Donald Trump's friend, but rather Trump is his patsy who will enable Russia to continue their aggression.\nI had hoped that President Trump would allay these fears and explain away this foreboding shift in all that we hold dear, but while Trump's speech to Congress was the longest in history there was no effort to explain. There was only more pressure on Ukraine to meet Russia's demands.\nWhat a terrible turn of events, we have abdicated all the principles of fairness and defending those who need our help, trying to make the world a better place and for what? Allowing a self-absorbed, deeply troubled man in the White House to lead us into a relationship with our enemy that will cause great harm to us and to the rest of the world. What are the next steps in this saga? Are we going to side with the Russians in some conflict in Europe? I hope not, but Donald Trump shows no resistance to Putin.\nThis was reemphasized on Feb. 28 in the White House when Donald Trump and JD Vance told our ally Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky that they are on their own, we the United States will not help them. While Russia continues to advance on Ukraine, President Trump has once again impounded the military aid to Ukraine that Congress appropriated, halted our intelligence assistance to Ukraine, ceased our offensive cyberattacks in response to Russian cyberattacks, cut off any hope of Ukrainian membership in NATO, and called Zelensky a dictator.\nTrump even asked us to doubt that Zelensky wants to stop the slaughter of his people in this conflict, that he doesn't want peace badly enough. This is code to Zelensky to agree to Russian demands for territory at the negotiating table. What price has Trump demanded of Putin? Nothing. Trump wants us to reward Russia with membership in the G7.\nWe all need to strongly resist this course of action and direction for the sake of our country, our democratic heritage, our children and ourselves. Please. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "DOGE is not first attempt to reduce government\n\n March 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 948\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Hardly a day goes by without continuous updates from Washington, D.C., on plans of and actions by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, commonly referred to as DOGE.President Trump created DOGE with an executive order on the first day of his second term, affirming it is a key element of his second term agenda. Elon Musk is heading DOGE as a special government employee.\nStrong resistance to DOGE started immediately and has not slowed since then. A lawsuit challenging the legality and authority of was filed the same day DOGE was created. Since then, numerous lawsuits have been filed, including those charging DOGE's efforts to access federal agency data violate federal privacy laws.\nAs of now, questions on how many and exactly how the U.S. Supreme Court will address these lawsuits is anyone's guess.\nOne question not receiving much attention is the history of and possible lessons learned from past efforts on improving government efficiency and reducing government spending.\nThe first such effort occurred in 1947 when Congress created the Commission on the Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, commonly referred to as the Hoover Commission, as former President Herbert Hoover chaired it.\nIn 1953, Congress approved the Second Commission on the Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government also commonly referred to as a Hoover Commission, as former President Hoover chaired it.\nIn 1982, former President Reagan created The President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control, commonly referred to as the Grace Commission, as it was chaired by corporate executive J. Peter Grace, who was an industrialist and CEO of W.R. Grace and Company, a diversified chemical company.\nIn 1993, former President Clinton launched the National Performance Review (NPR), also commonly referred to as Reinventing Government. Leading it was former Vice President Gore.\nFormer President Obama established three groups. They were the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform whose co-chairs were former U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles; the Domenici-Rivlin Debt Reduction Task Force, chaired by former U.S. Sen. Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin, former director of the Office of management and Budget and former Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair. The third group, Campaign to Cut Waste, was a large group of Obama administration officials with the stated goal of \"hunting down and eliminating misspent tax dollars in every agency and department across the Federal Government.\"\nIn a recent article on President Trump's DOGE initiative, John Kamensky, emeritus senior fellow at the IBM Center for The Business of Government, and Mark Abramson, president at Leadership Inc., suggest the following key elements are important for success in federal government spending change efforts:\n\"Making government work better can gain significant support in Congress as was seen in the first Hoover Commission and the Reinventing Government initiatives. When recommendations need congressional approval, being fast can make a difference. When a reform initiative spans the life of more than one Congress — and there is a chance that either house may flip to the opposing party — then bolder recommendations can be jeopardized. Moving fast also allows more time to focus on implementation. This was a strength of the Reinventing Government initiative.\nReform efforts that try to make government cheaper, such as by eliminating programs or reducing headcount, necessarily involve Congress. Such an emphasis was a stumbling block for the second Hoover Commission and the Grace Commission. Including career civil servants in the work of a reform initiative can increase the success of the \"improving program\" initiatives since they can gain \"buy-in\" from the civil service. In contrast, the \"eliminating programs\" approach has been predominately staffed by individuals outside of government, and civil service \"buy-in\" was not sought.\nKamensky and Mark Abramson conclude with writing, \"At the time of this writing, DOGE has not been operating like any of these past reform efforts, where the need for change is assessed, and recommendations are made for the president and Congress to act upon.\"\nI suggest there is a crucial omission from their observations on the underlying rationale on President Trump's decisions to move quickly and aggressively on the DOGE agenda. Those decisions include bypassing Congress for input on and approval of DOGE goals and operations.\nI suggest Trump's thinking reflects a sense of urgency on addressing the steadily increasing national debt. In 2000, that debt was $5.659 trillion, approximately 56% of the country's gross domestic product. By 2010, the national debt was $13.562 trillion, approximately 93% of GDP. It is projected to reach $37 trillion in June of this year.\nDespite current and yet to be filed court challenges to DOGE, it remains to be seen what the final decisions will be on those court challenges, especially any rulings handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nI suggest any mandates on congressional involvement on DOGE plans and actions may not be relevant going forward, even if the courts rule that a president cannot implement DOGE activities without some levels of congressional input and approval.\nThe current Republican majorities in Congress have been relatively uninvolved in any efforts to slow down or stop DOGE plans and actions.\nIf court rulings do limit the scope and authority of DOGE, I suggest Congressional Republicans will move to approve whatever is deemed legally necessary to allow DOGE plans and actions to continue.\nAs always that could change based on the results of the 2026 midterm election cycle which is already underway.\nI further suggest, if Republicans retain control of Congress in the 2026 mid-term elections, they will be even more inclined to approve future DOGE plans and actions at least through the end of Trump's second term.\nIf the Democrats regain control of the House, the Senate or both, DOGE will be no more than a footnote in the history of Trump's second term. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The chance to say \"thank you\" to a remarkable generation drew the attention of several community leaders.\n\"The World War II generation is just something different,\" Brandon Temple, chairman of the Calvert Commission for Veterans and Military Families, said.\nThe event was a collaborative effort by the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\nIn fact, it was VFW Post 2632 in St. Mary's County that received an inquiry that led to the special event.\nMarco Padilla wanted to make sure his grandfather's contributions eight decades ago would be remembered for his 100th birthday. Robert \"Roberto\" Augusto Padilla turned 100 on Tuesday.\n\"We all knew he was going to live to be 100,\" Marco told Southern Maryland News. \"He's incredibly healthy. We just wanted to honor him. We reached out to the VFW, we went to their website.\"\nRoberto Padilla's story is a wartime odyssey that led to U.S. citizenship that was paid forward from day one.\n\"He was born in Guatemala,\" Marco said. \"His father was a diplomat. He lived in Italy until he was 17.\"\nWhen Roberto's family moved to the U.S., the teen enlisted in the U.S. Army and became part of the U.S. Army's 23rd infantry.\n\"He was a medic,\" Marco said of his grandfather, who served from July 1943 to May 12, 1945.\nRoberto saw action during the Normandy invasion in 1944, which helped librate Europe.\nFor his bravery and as one of the country's newer citizens, he was awarded the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal and an overseas service bar.\nWhen his military service ended, Roberto Padilla settled in Maryland, established a successful business in Washington, D.C., and raised seven children.\n\"He's our patriarch,\" Marco said. \"We're incredibly proud. We owe everything to him.\"\nMackall, who enlisted in 1944, embarked on a 24-year career with the U.S. Army, retiring in 1968 as a staff sergeant.\nDuring his military career, Mackall earned the National Defense Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster and the Army Commendation Medal. He is also recognized as an expert marksman.\nPost-military, Mackall served the Sunderland community as its postmaster for 20 years and has been active with the American Legion's Gray-Ray Post 220 in Prince Frederick.\nWhile Mackall's American Legion membership has spanned 80 years, Padilla had no prior veterans organization tie. That situation was remedied Sunday when the local legionnaires presented him with a membership.\nJoe Cicchollo, the Veterans of Foreign Wars' Maryland commander, told the audience the who participated in the World War II campaign truly are \"the greatest generation,\" making contributions to labor, economics and civic organizations.\n\"We have to say 'thank you' to the veterans,\" Cicchollo said.\n\"We've got a lot of good veterans here in Southern Maryland,\" Harry Pool, Post 2632 commander, said of the members who aid others in the community. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Relighting candles over the years\n\n March 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 335\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recently, as I was sorting through papers I have kept over the years, I came across a letter to the editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer that I had written on March 30, 1982. Of course, I was much younger then.I had attended a peaceful protest march to Stop the Nuclear Arms Race. There were two images I particularly carried with me from that experience. I still do.\nQuoting from that letter: \"The first is the image of the middle of the road. With police and courteous drivers granting us the right of way, we walked literally down the middle of the roads leading from our meeting places to Independence Hall, over 15,000 people joined in a cause neither radical nor reactionary, but reasonable, logical, right and absolutely necessary.\"\n\"The second is the image of the lighted candle. In the cold night with a chill wind blowing, one has to be alert and active to keep one's candle burning. Mine went out several times, but when mine went out the candle of the person next to me seemed to stay lit. Someone's candle always re-lit mine, and I had chances to re-light others' too.\"\nWe are all older now, and the issues are surely different; however, some seem equally dangerous. The United States of America must not desert Ukraine and our allies in the free world. In my opinion that would be unprincipled, even immoral and extremely ill-advised for the sake of our own nation.\nAgain, quoting from the letter, \"I hope and pray our political, intellectual, scientific, social and religious leaders will put their enormous energies into finding a way that will not embrace the extreme ... but will find a way for peace with justice.\" I believe that is what the great majority of citizens in our country want, and it is our duty to say so. As someone who sometimes finds it hard to keep one candle lit, I think I must try harder. If this letter has re-lit anyone else's candle, I am glad.\nPATRICIA BRADLEY\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This illegal, terrorizing behavior would be expected from a dictatorship but not from our government.Any doubt as to the in terrorem role ICE would serve for the Trump regime is quickly vanishing. ICE is for Trump what the Gestapo was for Hitler, a force to stifle opposition with threats, force and torture.\nKhalil has no criminal record. All he did was to exercise his Constitutional rights by organizing peaceful protests at Columbia that opposed continued funding for Netanyahu as Netanyahu committed well-documented war crimes against Palestinians.\nWhen confronted, ICE first claimed Khalil's visa was being revoked but, when informed that he has a green card, changed its story to state his green card was being revoked. However, the decision to revoke a green card can only be made by an immigration judge after the government procures a warrant, makes a legal arrest, files charges, tries the person, convicts the person and allows that person to exhaust all appeals.\nInstead of allowing the due process our Constitution affords every person – citizen or not – the Trump regime executed an autocratic move to stifle dissent and disappear a dissenter that resembles the manner in which Putin deals with dissenters in Russia. This amounts to government terrorism and follows the Trump regime's open repression of student activism and political speech, in this instance criticism of Israel and Netanyahu. Thus, the Trump regime has shown it will use immigration to suppress free speech.\nIf Columbia secretly colluded with the Trump regime in the arrest, it may be a result of the regime's recent cancellation of $400 million in grants and contracts. Trump proved that he is willing to use extortion to achieve personal goals when threatened to withhold funding to force Ukraine to announce an investigation of Biden, so it is not surprising that Trump would use extortion to force colleges to kowtow to his wishes to silence dissent by wrongfully withholding the funds they are entitled to receive, but it is chilling.\nAmericans must speak out against this brutal and illegal conduct.\nJACK L.

I am sure they were not fired for cause. They were fired because Elon Musk was given authority to fire government employees, and he appears to get his gets kicks doing that. (See his chainsaw antics at CPAC.)\nWhere are those two fired scientists going to get private sector jobs? As reported in the Chesapeake Bay Journal March 2025, Trump is destroying all Bay protection agencies. Musk is firing federal scientists everywhere. Will Harris name some private companies that are going to take over protection of the Chesapeake Bay? Tesla? Starlink? Meta? Amazon? Maybe the two Oxford scientists can get jobs at an Amazon warehouse.\nJobs for the thousands of employees working for Veterans Affairs have been targeted for firing. People have been fired from security agencies that protect us from Russia. What companies are going to do that work? United Heath Care? Pfizer? Maybe each person buying Trump's gold card for $5 million to enter the U.S. will be required to adopt two veterans and assign one person to provide cybersecurity for America.\nMr. Harris's answer that private sector jobs will fulfill these requirements is a tragic joke.\nMr. Harris is also quoted as saying what an honor it was for him to sit next to the leader of the free world. That can't be Trump. He directed the U.S. to vote with North Korea, Iran and Russia denying a resolution supporting Ukraine. A prominent Republican of old called North Korea and Iran part of the \"Axis of Evil.\" The free world, they ain't.\nMany countries in the free world are at economic war with us. Our free world friends, such as Canada, are being courted by China to get themselves out of Trump's toxic world order.\nThe free world is divorcing us, and it seems everyone knows that except Mr. Harris.\nIf you disagree with Musk disemboweling the government while gleefully prancing around and ruining lives, and you disagree with Trump catering to Putin while making economic war against allies, vote Harris out in 2026.\nMICHAEL DAVIS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In it, Roberts explained Article II authority in the U.S. Constitution \"generally includes the ability to remove executive officials.\"\nHe also says that is \"a power that is necessary to ensure the accountable and effective execution of federal policy.\"\nShapiro also notes that Roberts has stated, without the power to remove executive branch officers, \"the president could not be held fully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities; the buck would stop somewhere else.\"\nThe key word in Chief Justice Roberts thinking is \"generally.\"\nThe Merriam-Webster's dictionary defines \"generally\" as often or regularly.\nIt does not define \"generally\" as \"always.\"\nThat is affirmed by recent actions by Chief Justice Roberts on two lower court rulings on DOGE.\nIn the first action Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined the Supreme Court's left-of-center bloc of justices in blocking President Trump's efforts to freeze $2 billion in foreign aid funding and temporarily blocking budget cuts.\nIn the second action, Roberts and Coney Barrett agreed with a majority of their left-of-center colleagues on a decision that the court would not overrule a temporary order from a lower court to stop Trump from firing the head of the Office of Special Counsel.\nThese two actions refute the idea that members of the conservative bloc are unified and consistently unable to reach agreement with members of the left-of-center Justices.\nIt also demonstrates that Roberts and Coney Barrett are willing to side against Trump in legal challenges on certain DOGE Issues.\nMost importantly, it affirms that the issue of presidential authority and power will require extraordinarily intense dialogue and deliberations among all the justices on the short-term and long-term ramifications of their ultimate decisions.\nPayvan Ahdout, a law professor at the University of Virginia, suggests the court is \"open to a role for judicial review of these [DOGE] decisions, but they just have not yet reached consensus on what that judicial role should be.\"\nGoing forward, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Coney Barrett could be part of majority member rulings that all, most, some or few of DOGE actions are unconstitutional or could be constitutional with revisions.\nIf both do so, the outcomes will be 6-3 majority rulings for DOGE.\nIf only one does, it will still be 5-4 rulings for DOGE.\nConversely, if both join again with three of left-of-center justices to sustain lower court challenges against DOGE it will be 5-4 rulings against DOGE.\nUltimately, every Supreme Court review and ruling on every lower court DOGE ruling will determine the future scope of DOGE's constitutional authority, plans, efforts, success or failure to meet projected results. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In an interview with WHCP radio, Harris stated that these were not his constituents; moreover, that they were each being paid $40 an hour to be there.On both counts, he was mistaken.\nIt's easy to understand how Harris might think we are not his constituents because he is barely our representative. In 14 years, he has initiated one bill in Congress.\nProud of that record?\nAs for being paid, Mr. Harris told a flat out lie, which seems to have become the stock communication style for members of the MAGA party.\nBut of course, you knew that.\nRICHARD BEARMAN\nCambridge \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

President Joe Biden put together a NATO-based coalition that effectively provided arms, intelligence and money to help Ukraine resist the Russian attack and survive.When Donald Trump became president the first time, he withheld that support telling Volodymyr Zelensky the aid would resume if he provided political dirt on Joe Biden. Zelensky refused, and Trump shut off $214 million in military assistance, which the general counsel of the U.S. Comptroller General declared an illegal impoundment.\nUnder bipartisan political pressure, Trump resumed the aid. When he began his second presidency, Trump once again withheld arms, cut off military intelligence and support, pressuring Zelensky to accept an end to the war. Trump and Vance publicly insulted Zelensky in the Oval Office and called him a dictator but refused to criticize Putin.\nTrump then began offering concessions to Putin before peace negotiations even began. Putin responded by dragging his feet on a cease fire, accelerating attacks on Ukraine, and asking for more concessions, making a mockery of Trump's negotiating skills. Ukraine remains a steppingstone for further Russian aggression.\nWhy would we suddenly embrace a dictator and invader?\nUkraine is fighting for democracy and the very freedoms we enjoy. The world looks to the United States for leadership and strength. Abandoning and humiliating an ally shows neither. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It's hard even imaging that horror show.Why would anyone subject themself to the shouting and abuse from such a meeting? We have already seen these same embarrassing displays on TV before. Another protester Ms. Frost said that she was concerned that Harris' agenda was more aligned with DOGE than with his constituents.\nNews Flash. Mr Harris was elected by the constituents who voted for him, not against him. Obama once said, \"Elections have consequences.\"\nI'm assuming the group looking to elect progressive leaders missed that message from Barack Obama himself.

JUST SAY NO AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!,\" Trump said.\nEarlier this week, Trump also said from the Oval Office he backed eliminating federal funding for public media.\nCongressional Republicans are looking at funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps fund PBS and NPR stations nationwide.\nCPB received $535 million in the most recent annual federal budget. The nonprofit was created by Congress in 1967.\n\"Reducing or eliminating CBP funding would save the federal government little (maximum of $535 million) while having dire though not universally fatal consequences for public broadcasting,\" said Michael Montgomery, a political scientist and professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.\nMontgomery contends the funding elimination push from Trump and conservatives is about their objections to what they see as NPR's and PBS' liberal slants.\n\"Make no mistake, if it happens, killing CPB will not be about saving money - this is about quieting voices and content that those on the right find objectionable or inconvenient,\" Montgomery said.\nSome of Trump's most ardent supporters in the GOP-controlled Congress also want to eliminate government money for public media.\n\"We will defund NPR and PBS!!,\" said U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, in a social media statement responding to Trump. \"The American people will NOT pay for disgusting Democrat propaganda anymore!!.\"\nGreene is critical of PBS' coverage of LGBTQ communities, including saying at a congressional hearing Wednesday that it promotes a \"trans agenda\" pointing to a local affiliate's airing of a segment featuring drag artists.\nDuring the same hearing on CPB funding Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, grilled NPR President CEO Katherine Maher about her progressive social media posts on white supremacy, reparations and civil unrest in 2020 and 2021.\nMaher became NPR boss in 2024.\nShe said her views have evolved, that NPR was working to offer a wider variety of perspectives in its coverage and had created new protocols to avoid bias, stressing the need for editorial independence.\nMaher also stressed the need for public media in rural and lower-income communities.\n\"Public radio is very often the only news service in places where market economics does not support the expense of local news,\" she told the House panel.\nMontgomery said NPR gets approximately 1% of its funding from CPB compared to roughly 14% for PBS.\n\"At the local level, an end of CPB funding would hit public TV harder than radio but public broadcasters of both types are likely to cut back, consolidate, or go silent,\" he said.\nPublic TV and radio stations and programs they produce would have to backfill any lost federal funding with money from other sources including donors, foundations and corporations.\nRick Ellis, founder and managing editor of Minnesota-based AllYourScreens.com (which tracks media news and industries), said defunding has been a desire of conservatives who either don't like government money for media outlets or \"what they consider to be liberal programming.\"\n\"They haven't been able to eliminate the spending in the past in large part because the areas that would be most impacted by the cuts are rural areas that are also Republican strongholds. And overall, government financing for public media is pretty popular with voters,\" he said.\nEllis points to a Pew Research Center poll released Wednesday showing 24% of respondents favor nixing government funding for PBS and NPR, while 43% support public media funding and 33% are not sure.\n\"In theory, it would probably be politically less complicated for public media to move away from government funding. But while it is overall a small slice of public media financing, it's tough to replace any other way,\" Ellis said.\nHe said larger public media outlets in bigger, more affluent cities will survive the funding loss.\n\"But it would be enough of a loss to decimate outlets in Alaska, Hawaii and a number of Midwestern and Southern states, which are smaller and already struggle to get funding from foundations, viewers and listeners,\" Ellis said.\nA number of local and statewide NPR and PBS stations have not yet responded to requests for comments about defunding and how they might navigate a new financial landscape, including their ties to universities and community colleges (which are also under fire from Trump).\nThe Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 has called for defunding CPB in its austerity blueprints, citing liberal biases and questioning the necessity of government outlays.\nElon Musk, who owns the X social media platform and runs Trump's Department of Government Efficiency efforts, has also echoed conservative calls to defund public media, in particular NPR. Trump said earlier this week DOGE efforts could also target public media funding.\nIrina Tsukerman, president of New York-based Scarab Rising Inc. (a geopolitical consulting firm) said funding cuts could result in public media jobs cuts, less local programming and potentially station closures.\nShe also sees wider media impacts.\n\"Public media plays a unique role in the media ecosystem, providing high-quality, in-depth journalism that is free from the commercial pressures faced by corporate media,\" Tsukerman said, pointing to investigative, cultural and educational content that might not be pursued by other outlets.\n'The removal of federal funding would push these stations to rely more heavily on private donations and corporate sponsorships, potentially influencing editorial independence and leading to content shifts that prioritize profitability over public service,\" she said.\nTrump and his populist backers are vehement critics of many traditional media outlets, accusing them of liberal bias.\nTrump routinely calls journalists \"enemies of the state,\" frequently characterizing critical coverage of himself and his administration as fabricated or \"witch hunts.\"\nA number of major U.S. media outlets and social media platforms are owned by conglomerates such as the Fox Corp. and Walt Disney Co. or some of the wealthiest persons in the world such as Musk, Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos and Meta/Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.\nThe latter trio were all front and center at Trump's inauguration in January inside the U.S. Capitol.\n\"A weakened public media sector benefits those who prefer a media environment dominated by private interests, where corporate-backed outlets and partisan networks can exert greater influence over public discourse,\" Tsukerman said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lessons learned from Donald Trump’s campaigns\n\n March 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 797\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After every presidential election cycle, political pundits do a deep dive analysis on campaign strategies that were effective before the campaign launch and during the campaign.One of the most insightful and thought provoking analyses I have seen was written by Michael Grynbaum and John Koblin, published in the New York Times the day after the election.\nIn their article — \"Master of the Media Evolved Yet Again\" — Grynbaum and Koblin wrote, \"In his improbable journey to the apex of American power, President-elect Donald J. Trump has always adapted to the media tool of the moment.\"\nFormer president of CBS News, Andrew Heyward, echoes that conclusion: \"He's always looking to the next venue that's best suited to his instincts for generating support. It's part of Trump's extraordinary record of instinctively finding ways to viscerally connect with voters. He's a master of evolving media.\"\nThese observations are not a surprise based on reviewing Trump's career before his running for the presidency three times.\nWell before he ran for president the first time in 2016, Trump generated substantial name recognition in New York City and beyond with regular coverage in the New York Post. The Post, a daily tabloid newspaper, has the fourth-largest circulation of a printed newspaper in America. Its readership goes well beyond New York with a subscription-based online version.\nIn 2004, Trump recognized and seized an opportunity for even greater public exposure as the co producer and host of the reality TV show \"The Apprentice.\"\nDuring a long run on NBC TV, Trump worked hard to be viewed as a successful and decisive business mogul, willing to dismiss apprentice contestants with a memorable \"you're fired.\"\nThe result of that name recognition together with his \"take charge\" personality, was a key element in Trump defeating a large field of candidates in the 2016 Republican presidential primary elections. That led to a widely unexpected Electoral College win in November 2024.\nGrynbaum and Koblin wrote, \"Trump recognized the power of Twitter long before other politicians, and in 2016, he started doing cable news interviews.\"\nThey also wrote that he bypassed traditional media gatekeepers like \"60 Minutes\" on CBS, in favor of select online celebrities and podcasts that were especially popular among young men.\nAs an example, Grynbaum and Koblin noted that \"Bryson DeChambeau, a two-time U.S. Open golfing champion and YouTube star, did a video with Trump that had almost 13 million views.\"\nMore important than the always critical role of positive name recognition in any election, Grynbaum and Koblin suggested that bypassing the mainstream media allowed Trump to avoid confrontational interviews where he might have faced tough questions, fact-checks and detailed policy debates.\nBy contrast, Grynbaum and Koblin suggested the carefully selected influencers Trump met rarely challenged him and often lavished him with praise.\nThe political wisdom of that strategy was affirmed in the one debate hosted by ABC news. Donald Trump did not do as well as expected, and Kamala Harris did better than expected.\nFollowing that debate, Trump declined to participate in a second debate and also pulled out of a planned interview with 60 Minutes. His decision not to appear was the first time since the late 1960s, when the program did not include host the two major-party presidential candidates.\nTrump's ignoring 60 Minutes was one of many based on his lack of trust in and disdain for many traditional legacy media outlets that he believed were left of center and hostile to him.\nDespite the risk of a negative voter reaction to his positions on the traditional media outlets, Trump assumed correctly that it would energize and mobilize his base if he regularly ignored and aggressively criticized the media, especially the legacy media.\nEven before that decision on 60 Minutes was made, Trump was showing up on podcasts, widely viewed as unconventional and even odd in the context of a presidential campaign.\nHis first podcast with online star and wrestler Logan Paul met that profile. Trump and Paul discussed boxing, immigration and the possible existence of extraterrestrial life.\nSome may say this commentary is all about Trump. I agree. The reasons are simple.\nDonald Trump has been elected president twice. This commentary includes my thoughts and thoughts of others on how the role of effective communication strategies contributed to those outcomes.\nKamala Harris has not yet been elected president and maybe never will be. In any event, I expect to do another commentary that will include my thoughts and the thoughts of others on how flawed communication strategies contributed to her loss in 2024.\nFor now, campaign communications strategies covered in this commentary, may or may not be relevant in upcoming elections in 2026, 2028 and beyond.\nThat said, I suggest there is one timeless lesson for all political candidates going forward. That lesson is: never fail to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of and use best practice in campaign communications strategies, especially those that are emerging. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Loss of federal funds could leave migrant children in the lurch\n\n April 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PAUL KIEFER Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 803\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Trump administration is moving ahead with plans to end a contract that pays for the legal representation of children navigating immigration court cases after entering the country without parents or guardians.That decision could have outsize impacts in Maryland, where a disproportionate share of unaccompanied immigrant children have landed in recent years, often fleeing violence, sexual abuse, and neglect.\nThe state's nonprofit legal aid groups are now grappling with the prospect of young clients facing the courts alone, raising the risk that children miss hearings, lose connections to service providers, and receive deportation orders.\nEstefani Flores Portillo, a social services coordinator with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, says the loss of funding could also leave more than a thousand clients across Maryland — most in their teens — to balance fending for themselves in immigration court with the day-to-day challenges of acclimating to a new country.\n\"Outside of their legal case, they also have other priorities,\" she said. Most of her clients are enrolled in school, some hold down jobs to cover basic living expenses, and many require therapy to process traumas inflicted both in their home countries and during their journeys to the U.S.\nBurdened with those competing pressures, she added, \"it would be hard for them to focus on the legal case\" without the assistance of an attorney.\nOn March 21, the administration notified nonprofit legal aid groups providing representation for unaccompanied immigrant children that it would terminate the contract that funds their work. Those legal aid groups collectively represent more than 26,000 children with cases before immigration courts across the country, and they provide consultations and referrals to thousands more each year.\nThe withdrawal of federal support for legal representation of immigrant children comes as immigration courts struggle to manage a staggering backlog of cases, including more than 50,000 in Maryland alone as of February 2025.\nMaryland has received among the largest numbers of unaccompanied immigrant children in the past decade relative to other states.\nData from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) indicates that nearly 40,000 unaccompanied immigrant children have been released to sponsors — either family members or volunteers — in Maryland since 2014. A majority of those children arrived after 2020, primarily from Central America.\nOnly Texas, California, Florida and New York received more unaccompanied immigrant children in the same period.\nRoughly 13,000 of those children landed in Prince George's County alone, though even some corners of rural Maryland have seen hundreds of new arrivals in the past five years.\nEven with legal representation, unaccompanied children often spend years awaiting the resolution of their case, both because of the burden on immigration courts and asylum offices and because of the limited number of visas available each year.\n\"Kids don't want to think about these things longer than they have to,\" said Caroline Hodge, a supervising attorney with the Amica Center. The immigration court system is difficult enough for attorneys to navigate, she added, and children hardly stand a chance on their own.\nThough the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act requires HHS to provide legal counsel to all children in its care \"to the greatest extent possible,\" thousands of children with open immigration cases already lack representation.\nThat shortfall is driven in part by a nationwide shortage of immigration attorneys prepared to work with juvenile clients. Until this month, federal dollars also helped nonprofits like the Amica Center train attorneys willing to volunteer their time to represent children in immigration court. The end of the federal contract supporting her organization's work, Hodge said, also means her team will no longer be able to provide that training.\nImmigration court data collected by the U.S. Department of Justice between 2004 and 2016 suggests that roughly 60 percent of children with cases in a Maryland immigration court had legal representation during that period. The same data indicates that while nearly all children with attorneys appeared in court for a final decision in their case, only a third of those without attorneys did so.\n\"The idea of going to court is so terrifying for a child,\" Hodge said, \"and people without information, without representation, will definitely feel more fearful to engage.\"\nThe Trump administration has already signaled its interest in following through on deportation orders issued for children who fail to appear for immigration court hearings.\nMaryland's Department of Human Services, which houses the state's Office for Refugees and Asylees, has so far avoided commenting on the end of federal funding for immigrant children's legal representation. A department spokesperson referred CNS to its federal counterpart, HHS, for comment, though that agency likewise did not immediately respond to inquiries about the expected outcomes of the decision.\nMeanwhile, legal aid groups told Capital News Service that some attorneys fear that continuing to offer pro bono legal assistance to immigrants will make them targets, citing the White House's recent efforts to punish law firms deemed hostile to the administration. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Rep. Harris defends federal funding cuts during virtual town hall\n\n April 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 457\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) stood by recent federal funding cuts by the Trump administration during a virtual town hall Tuesday.It was the congressman's second telephone town hall in two weeks, following multiple in-person protests of Harris on the Eastern Shore, where constituents demanded he host a town hall.\nTuesday, many of the 12 callers that spoke expressed frustrations with funding and staffing cuts to Medicaid, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies.\nIn response to a question about USDA program cuts, Harris said the Trump administration is focused on pandemic-era funds.\n\"The philosophy is that COVID is over and we probably ought to end the COVID-era programs,\" Harris said. \"Since we started the COVID programs, the federal budget has gone from $4.5 trillion to $7 trillion in six short years. We're going to have to look program by program.\"\nOne caller pushed Harris on why he supports caps to Medicaid funding, stating that any federal drawback will force states to assume more of the burden.\n\"Medicaid is not an entitlement. It is a vital public service,\" the caller stated. \"I get it, it's expensive, and we have to find a way to pay for it... Lives are tied to this, as well as critical services that the Maryland Eastern Shore depends upon.\"\nHarris said, \"It's fair that we ask the states\" to cover more of the costs for non-disabled individuals under Medicaid. He argued for the federal government to control its growth of Medicaid contributions.\nA Harford County caller posed a question about how Department of Education cuts will impact Maryland. Most recently, the department announced it won't pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in COVID-19 spending that was previously approved, though that action wasn't specifically discussed during the town hall.\nHarris emphasized his support to \"take Washington out of the equation\" and give control to local school boards and states. He added that \"teachers' unions are not good for our students.\"\n\"The teachers' unions are interested in the teachers and what a contract looks like, how many vacation days you get, how many days off you get, things like that,\" Harris said, \"not in what's actually going to work to make our students function better in a global environment.\"\nToward the end of the hour-long virtual town hall, Harris reiterated his support for the Trump administration and Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, which is leading many of the efforts to reduce federal spending.\n\"No it's not a perfect job,\" Harris said of Musk's DOGE efforts. \"No it's not the way it's usually done in the federal government. But time is of the essence here.\"\nHarris said 3,900 people attended Tuesday's telephone town hall and that there will likely be another held this summer. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Auctioneers assured bidders that their identities are not revealed.\n\"We tried to sell it last auction with a big reserve, and I called it … radioactive,\" Panagopulos said about Epstein's notebook moments before the auction started Wednesday morning. \"There are people who won't even touch it, right?\"\nThe book went on quite a journey before the Elkton-based auctioneer acquired the black plastic Gestetner-bound contact log. Denise Ondayko, a musician from the East Village, claims she found the book on a Manhattan sidewalk in the 1990s, according to Business Insider. After Epstein's death in 2019, she put it up for sale on eBay.\nChristopher Helali — the International Secretary for the American Communist Party, who was working as an independent reporter — purchased it for a mere $425, according to the New York Post.\n\"Nobody believes it's real. He buys it for nothing, and he is more interested in the story than in the value of the piece,\" Panagopulos said, adding that Helali had Business Insider bring in a forensic expert to authenticate the book.\nThe 4.5-inch-by-5.25 inch book contains 386 printed entries varying in length from one or two lines to 10 or 15 lines each. It has two additional entries written in what looks like Epstein's handwriting, but is too small to tell, according to the auction item description. There are five highlighted names who are all well recognized financial and industrial professionals, including current president Donald Trump.\nThe FBI discovered a different \"little black book\" of Epstein's circa 2004, and used it in legal proceedings throughout his various for soliciting prostitution from minors and federal sex trafficking. FBI investigations started in 2005, with a pause for several years in between, and ended in 2019 when the criminal was found dead in his jail cell, which investigators declared a suicide, according to the Associated Press.\nThe earlier book — which was just sold at auction — was not considered important to the investigation when it was discovered. The two volumes combined hold 1,731 names, 221 of which are in the earlier book, but not the 2004 version, according to Business Insider. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "We must keep interest on civil, respectful dialog\n\n April 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 848\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Following World War II, Winston Churchill was facing two daunting political and governing challenges in pivoting from serving as a wartime to a post war leader of Britain.The first challenge was how Britain should deal with Germany, whose leaders were ruthless adversaries who inflicted massive amounts of death, pain and suffering on Britain during a six-year war; including bombing raids on London that killed and injured innocent civilians. The second challenge was how Britain should deal with the Soviet Union whose leaders were key allies during that same war, but post war; those same leaders were pursuing, maintaining and expanding the Soviet Union's spheres of influence and their communist ideology worldwide.\nChurchill's guiding principle forward was pragmatic. In a world characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, he would not expect permanent allies or permanent adversaries. He would pursue permanent interests.\nRecently, two U.S. senators from Pennsylvania embraced Churchill's guiding principle in American politics in a relatively small, but very instructive way. What makes this instructive is these two senators have deeply held and stark differences in their political allegiances and political philosophies.\nJohn Fetterman is a left-of-center Democratic senator who was endorsed by Bernie Sanders in his successful Senate primary election campaign and his successful general election campaign.\nIn the 2024 Presidential election, Fetterman strongly supported Joe Biden's reelection and strongly defended Biden when there were widespread calls for him to withdraw from the race.\nWhen Biden did withdraw and was replaced by Kamala Harris as the Democratic standard bearer, Fetterman endorsed her and campaigned for her throughout Pennsylvania.\nDavid McCormick is a right-of-center Republican senator who was endorsed by Donald Trump in his successful Senate primary campaign and his successful general election campaign.\nIn McCormick's challenge to Pennsylvania's then incumbent left-of-center Democratic Sen. Robert Casey, Fetterman endorsed Casey and campaigned for him.\nSince those elections, their differences have not stopped the two senators from working together on select issues of shared interest, shared thinking and mutual respect.\nOne example is the role of mentorships in changing lives.\nBoth McCormick and Fetterman have a deep commitment to mentoring based on their respective firsthand experiences.\nWhile in college, Fetterman's best friend died in a car accident. Immediately following that tragedy, Fetterman volunteered to be a mentor for Big Brothers and Big Sisters of America. He was assigned to an 8-year-old boy whose father had died from AIDS and whose mother was dying from cancer. Fetterman promised the boy's mother he would continue to be his mentor after her death.\nIn high school, McCormick was a mediocre benchwarmer on the football team. A new coach saw promise in him, mentored him and made McCormick one of the team's co-captains. That experience helped McCormick boost his low self-confidence and graduate from West Point.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, McCormick and his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, concluded that too many Americans, including their six daughters, suffered greatly from a lack of mentors.\nAs a result, they coauthored \"Who Believed in You?\" a book that includes interviews with successful leaders who had a mentor who saw something in them they may not have seen in themselves and helped them find and achieve their purpose in life.\nThose interviewed include Gov. Wes Moore; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Tory Burch, chief creative fashion designer and executive chairperson of Tory Burch LLC as well as founder of the Tory Burch foundation; Hollywood producer Brian Grazer, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\nAs a result of their mutual appreciation of the value of mentoring, McCormick, Fetterman, and their spouses (both of whom also have personal positive mentoring stories to share), agreed to three events where they would discuss their experiences and promote Who Believed in You?\nMcCormick, Fetterman and their spouses also met for a dinner, a most effective way for people to get to know, understand and respect each other. Following that dinner McCormick said, \"I trust him. I think he's a very authentic guy. I think he's going to be a good partner.\"\nSadly, the first two of the mentoring events were postponed due to \"unforeseen logistical issues\" and the third event was canceled due to a \"scheduling conflict.\" I believe the reasons were concerns over peaceful outcomes from protests before, during or after the events.\nThis is a prime example of how a tyranny of the loud is regularly disrupting much needed efforts to advance the cause of civil political discourse in our society.\nThis unexpected turn of events is also a call to action for elected officials and citizens in our community, our region, our state and our country to commit to doing two things.\nWe can, and we must replicate the actions of two these U.S. senators with efforts to get to know, understand, trust, respect and seek common ground with others who have opposite political affiliations and opposite views on many local, state and national public policy issues.\nMore importantly, we can, and we must commit to maintaining a permanent interest on civil and respectful dialogue, which will help us coexist in a society where even when we have inevitable disagreements on a wide range of public policy issues, we can disagree without being disagreeable. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "For many Social Security is their sole income\n\n April 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 678\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Frances Perkins, the famous female labor secretary appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt, chaired the committee that drafted legislation for Social Security, enacted in 1935.It was a reliable insurance system for all working Americans. If you paid into it monthly, you knew that if you lost your job, became disabled or died, you or your survivors would receive a pension based on how much you paid in. Before that, the consequence was often destitution. As of February 2025, an estimated 73.2 million Americans received Social Security checks. In Talbot County, 30% of residents rely on Social Security benefits for income. For nearly half of them, it is their sole income.\nSocial Security is so popular it is considered a \"third rail of politics\" because politicians dare not vote to reduce benefits, as they and their party will face certain defeat in the next election. Most Republicans and President Trump pledged before the election not to reduce Social Security benefits.\nInstead, Trump brought in his front man, Elon Musk and his DOGE musketeers to eviscerate Social Security, not by reducing benefits, but by slashing workers and field offices that make the program administrable. They suggest staff cutbacks of 7,000 persons, out of today's staff of 57,000 that is already considered insufficient. The ratio of one staffer to 1,369 beneficiaries is twice the ratio in 1995. The average processing time of disability claims has already doubled from four to eight months.\nMusk's approach avoids Republicans in Congress voting on the evisceration. Perhaps Musk will then sell Social Security to the highest bidder who will privatize it, promising to make it function again. (At the end of 2024, the two Social Security trust funds held approximately $2.027 trillion in asset reserves. These reserves are owned by the beneficiaries of the Social Security program.)\nWhat have the DOGE musketeers accomplished so far?\nSeveral people who are quite alive were declared dead and their benefits terminated. For example, Ned Johnson, an 82-year-old retiree from Seattle not only discovered his Social Security checks stopped, but more than $5,000 of his prior benefits were clawed back as he allegedly died on November 23, 2024. He waited for eight hours at the Seattle Social Security office to prove that he was still alive. That same office is now earmarked for closure. Earlier, Trump fired the inspector general who would have investigated and avoided such mistakes. DOGE musketeers also claimed to have found $232 million in waste to cut from Social Security. Closer examination changed that to $560,000.\nElon installed one of his musketeers, Leland Dudek, as acting commissioner. In response to a lawsuit, a judge forbade the DOGE musketeers from accessing sensitive taxpayer data. Dudek then threatened to bar Social Security employees from accessing Social Security systems. The next day Dudek backed down and let the employees resume their normal work.\nWhich field offices will be closed is still not decided. There were protests around the country outside field offices last weekend, and the public was very vocal about keeping their local Social Security offices open. The phone lines available for the elderly and disabled to discuss their claims are already shut down. People are told to do much of their business online. However, it is believed that about 10% of people over 65 are not computer literate. A new claimant must appear in person at a remaining office alive.\nFor those who rely on the check from Social Security to pay for the essentials every month, failure to receive it is an emergency. I encourage everybody to call or email Sens. Chris van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks, as well as Congressman Andy Harris to tell them to stop the plunder of the Social Security insurance program.\nOn June 1, 1950, Sen. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine stood up in the Senate chamber during a debate on Sen. Joseph McCarthy's claims of unidentified traitors in our government and said: \"It is high time we all stopped being tools and victims of totalitarian techniques — techniques that, if continued here unchecked, will surely end what we have come to cherish as the American way of life.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Protection or pain? Disparate views of Trump's immigration crackdowns, deportations\n\n April 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: National \n \n 1206\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n President Donald Trump's immigration raids and promises of mass deportations of undocumented migrants are very much in the eye of the beholder.For Trump and his populist supporters the immigration crackdowns are about arresting and deporting dangerous gang members and migrants with criminal records.\n\"I have no problem rounding up hardened gang members and the illegal aliens that associate with them and deporting them immediately. Those in our country to do harm don't deserve to be here,\" said U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Montana, in a recent social media statement.\nU.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican representing Maryland's Eastern Shore, also backs Trump's hardline approach. \"It's time to deport all criminal illegal aliens to keep our communities safe,\" Harris said in a social media statement.\nHe points to the recent murder, rape and sexual assault conviction of Victor Martinez-Hernandez, a fugitive from El Salvador, in the 2023 killing of Rachel Morin, 37, in Hartford County.\n\"Rachel Morin would be here today had it not been for the dangerous wide-open border policies of the Biden administration,\" Harris said in a statement.\nTrump's hardline immigration policies, which his backers hope include crackdowns on human trafficking, are among his most popular policies.\nA recent CBS News Poll found 58% of U.S. voters back Trump's deportation efforts, while the same percentage opposes his tariffs push.\nIn the other corner, progressive groups, including some Christian organizations, worry about expulsions of refugees and asylum seekers and arrests of undocumented immigrants who are working in the U.S.\n\"Our faith calls us to stand with children and families fleeing violence and persecution, not to turn them away. These orders place vulnerable lives in danger and foster a culture of exclusion and fear,\" said Sandy Ovalle, senior director of campaigns and mobilizing for Sojourners, a Christian social justice group.\n\"We must act in solidarity with those who are suffering and continue to advocate for policies rooted in justice, mercy, and love,\" she said.\nThe Washington D.C.-based group also worries about potential Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions impacting churches and schools.\n\"Serving migrant people is a religious liberty issue for many communities of faith. Relaxing the rules around immigration raids at sensitive locations like churches and schools makes it much more difficult for our houses of worship to serve as safe spaces for spiritual nourishment for all people, setting the stage for less safety and more trauma for everyone,\" Ovalle said.\nThe Sojourners group and Pope Francis have criticized Trump and other immigration hardliners for what they see as violations the biblical calls to welcome the stranger and to love thy neighbor.\nA recent report by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the National Association of Evangelicals, World Relief and other groups said more than 10 million of the undocumented immigrants in the U.S. who could be deported are Christians.\n\"Eighty percent of immigrants vulnerable to deportation identify as Christians, with 61% being Catholic and 13% identifying as evangelical Christians,\" according to the report.\nThe same study found 77% of asylum seekers are Christians and close to 7 million U.S. citizens \"live in households with someone at risk of deportation.\"\n'BAD THIN\nGS TO COME'\nKaren Hunter sees Trump's immigration raids and deportations through her church's lens.\nHunter is a priest at Grace Episcopal Church in Nampa, Idaho. Her congregation and the church's community ministries have included undocumented persons.\nShe's seen deportations during past U.S. administrations and worried about the downstream ramifications during the post-pandemic migrations under the Biden administration.\n\"When the Biden administration opened the border, I knew it was the beginning of bad things to come,\" Hunter said, pointing to stagnant working class wages, affordable housing shortages and strained schools and social services.\nThe post-pandemic surges in migrations during the Biden administration included more than 8.6 million border patrol encounters with migrants at the Mexico border and more than 5.8 million asylum applications, according to the Migration Policy Institute.\nSome of the migration surges came from conflict zones in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. Other migrants, including from Haiti and Latin America, were escaping gangs, crime, religious persecution, poverty and extreme weather events such as natural disasters and droughts.\n\"I knew it would eventually result in deportations and that people who were living here peacefully and productively would end up getting caught up in deportations and an unwillingness of the general population to make ways for those who should have a way to stay,\" Hunter said.\nShe's worried about what's next under Trump, who has designated Latin American gangs and drug cartels as terrorists and has deported some alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador.\n\"It is a painful thing to contemplate that some of our friends and members may face deportation,\" she said. \"I know from experience that there will not be relief for undocumented folks once they are picked up.\"\nTrump recently picked up a victory when the U.S. Supreme Court okayed his use of the 1798 wartime law the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan gang members to a prison in El Salvador.\nThe Trump camp has also criticized federal judges blocking the administration's immigration crackdowns.\n\"President Trump has made it his number-one priority to secure the border, defeat the cartels, and remove criminal aliens from American communities,\" said Chad Wolf, homeland security chair for the pro-Trump America First Policy Institute.\n\"The Trump administration has rightly indicated that they will use any legal authority available to protect Americans. Unfortunately, in recent weeks, partisan judges have repeatedly attempted to usurp the lawful power of the presidency to identify and remove terrorist organizations from our streets,\" said Wolf, who served in the first Trump administration.\nThe U.S. administration has also curtailed refugee and asylum programs and is also embroiled in fights over its attempts to revoke student visas and deport foreign students it has deemed supportive of Islamic militant groups in pro-Palestinian protests against U.S. military support for Israel and the post-Oct. 7 war in Gaza.\nU.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, traveled to El Salvador to visit Kilmar Abrego Garcia. The Salvadoran migrant, who lives in Maryland, was deported by the Trump administration, is being held in an El Salvador prison and there is a legal fight over bringing Garcia back to the U.S.\n\"The Trump (administration) can lie all they want, but the court said they failed to show he was part of MS-13. This is about bringing home a man they admit should've never been abducted. I won't rest until then,\" said Van Hollen, referring to the notorious Salvadoran gang and court rulings calling for Garcia to be returned to the U.S.\nTrump called Van Hollen \"a fool\" and \"grandstander\" over the visit. Harris and other Trump backers argue Democrats and progressives seem to care more gang members illegally in the U.S. than the victims of their crime, including human trafficking.\nIn Idaho, Hunter is frustrated with the situation undocumented migrants face and how they are viewed and treated by both sides.\n\"They become a kind of slaves. They have to put up with low wages and bad housing,\" she said.\n\"Even those in the media who seem to be advocating for undocumented people refer to them as the people who clean the houses and cut the grass or work in the fields. They do the work Americans won't do, they say. It's a short step from that thinking to 'they are here to serve us, to do our dirty work',\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

These rights apply to everyone in the United States including citizens, and with few exceptions, to non-citizens and legal residents. The First Amendment grants freedom of religion, press, assembly and petition. The fourth amendment protects against illegal searches, seizures and requires warrants.We now know that these rights are being violated by the Trump administration at an alarming frequency.\nPerhaps you read about the student at Columbia University, a legal permanent resident who has been arrested and detained, apparently without due process, for leading protests about the situation in Gaza. He has been sent to a detention center in Louisiana.\nAlso recently arrested without due process of law is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident. In a recent administrative error, Mr. Garcia was deported to a prison in El Salvador, despite a 2019 court order stating that deporting him to El Salvador could result in his harm or death from gangs there. Mr Garcia has no criminal record in the United States. The Supreme Court has decreed that the United States must correct its error and facilitate his return to the United States. The Trump administration denies having any responsibility to correct this error and states that the courts have no right to require the correction, and in short, it is none of their business.\nThese two cases are headlines but clear violations of the Bill of Rights. There are many more outrageous violations of our rights are occurring daily.\nOur rights are under attack. The president is interpreting the Bill of Rights to align with his own objectives.\nWe should all fear for ourselves. It is not hard to imagine that U.S. citizens and legal residents may be ensnared in efforts to deport or detain anyone who does not agree with the president. Mr. Trump has already expressed a wish to overturn the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States.\nWe all need to resist attacks on the rights that our Constitution grants us. Speak up or you may lose them. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Changes in Washington may start affecting many\n\n April 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JANE C. MURPHY | Section: Columns \n \n 938\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Each day brings more bad news. I am a retired law professor living in Oxford. I am used to viewing the daily news from a distance. I care deeply about the state of the world, my country and my state but fluctuations in foreign and domestic policy have rarely touched me directly.All that changed on Jan. 20. Despite the privileges and protections, I am granted as a white, financially comfortable, United States citizen, the relentless blows from the White House over the last few months have struck close to home. So, even if the existential threats to our democracy or the daily cruelty to our most vulnerable have not moved you, you might need to start paying attention.\nI'll start closest to home — my four adult children. Two of them are lawyers — one in Big Law and one a public defender. I worry about the attacks on my son's law firm and how it will affect him in both the short and long term. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that allows my daughter to work at a high-need, low-paying job while managing law school loans is on the chopping block. Another daughter, traveling in the Middle East as part of a Ph.D. program, is at risk due to the escalating violence in that part of the world because of Trump's threats against Palestine, Yemen and Iran. My youngest child works for a foundation supporting critical cancer research by \"filling in the gaps\" when National Institutes of Health grants fall short. Instead of celebrating the amazing leaps in cancer treatment, they are struggling to help keep labs open while rethinking their mission.\nI have lots of worries about my grandchildren growing up in a world where protecting the environment, demonstrating compassion for others and maintaining ethics in government have all but disappeared in Washington. But my more immediate concern is how a baby and a toddler, just beginning their vaccination schedules, will fare with a confirmed measles case in Maryland near their home and anti-vaxxers running our major health agencies.\nOne step removed from my children and grandchildren is my broad network of former students and other mentees in the legal profession. I have heard from some, among the best and the brightest, who had offers to work in the Honors Programs in various federal agencies rescinded. Others in probationary positions doing outstanding work have been fired.\nStill others, more long-term employees, have found themselves moved to distant buildings without parking, computers and, in one case, running water. I worry for these smart, hardworking young people and the future of the Rule of Law.\nMy husband and I are among the least vulnerable but these relentless reversals in policy have touched our lives in tangible ways.\nOur town, Oxford, has been, like many other places, adversely affected by climate change. A local lab, the Oxford Cooperative Laboratory, is funded in large part by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has a variety of important responsibilities including tracking rising temperatures and creating early warning systems for natural disasters.\nScientists at the Oxford lab have been working on a project to prevent the recurring flooding and shoreline erosion in areas I travel along daily. Consistent with this Administration's rejection of climate science and research, NOAA has recently had its funding slashed. As a result, two of the marine scientists involved in the anti-flooding work were abruptly let go. This left Oxford's shoreline project in limbo and potentially wasting the time and money already invested. Those scientists were also two more neighbors who have lost jobs.\nI am on the Board of Directors of the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, an Easton nonprofit whose mission is to \"empower people from different cultures to become successful and engaged members of our community\" As part of its mission, the center serves immigrant families from all over Talbot, Caroline and Dorchester counties. These families are valued members of our community, contributing to the culture and economy of our region.\nOur staff and board, always hard working, have been stretched thin trying to meet the needs of the families whose legal status in this country is threatened by near daily changes in immigration policy and enforcement. Even my \"happy place,\" the Talbot County public libraries, have been hit with federal budget cuts which will impact the purchase of equipment and collections, particularly for young children.\nFinally, the plunging stock market has, of course, led to declining retirement savings. Like many others, we worry about the unpredictable and damaging swings in the market that are wreaking havoc on our decadeslong savings. And a recent call to the Social Security Office in Cambridge to check on my Medicare payments included a much longer than usual hold time, leaving me with concerns about the future of that income stream as well. And, as income drops, we can all expect food and other prices to rise as farmers and others deal with ever-changing tariffs.\nTo be clear, this is not a plea for sympathy for millennial professionals or their comfortable parents. Nothing I have described comes close to the harms that have been inflicted on millions of people who are more seriously and directly being hurt every day — immigrants deported or living in fear of it, federal workers who have lost jobs in mid- or late-career, patients who have lost access to life-saving drugs, and so many more. But if you're thinking of sitting this one out because of the invulnerability you normally feel, think again.\nOur fates are interconnected. And even the many and deep protections that your race, wealth and citizenship have always afforded you may not be enough to protect you this time around. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He had recently been released from a 38-day hospital stay for pneumonia.\nFrancis had served as the head of the Catholic Church since 2013.\n\"I just really liked and respected him,\" said the Rev. James Nash, pastor of Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Easton. \"As much as I'm sad to see that he is no longer with us, it did appear that he was suffering a lot. He's with the Lord, and he's experiencing everything that he believes, so I just hope he prays for us up there and gives us a little direction somehow.\"\nNash considered Francis to be a strong influence on his personal thinking and on the church. Nash's biography on Sts. Peter and Paul's website includes a quote from the pope.\nLike most, Nash didn't know much about Francis when he was named pope in 2013. But Nash took an immediate liking to Francis' down-to-earth approach.\n\"When he was elected, I didn't really know anything about him,\" Nash said. \"But when he came out onto the balcony and he said 'Buona sera' (meaning good evening in Italian), everybody was just so thrilled that he was just so down to earth.\"\nNash also enjoyed Francis' teachings, which he said reminded members of the Catholic Church of what Jesus would want them to do.\n\"His focus for all of us was to remind us about the care for the poor,\" Nash said. \"That was really obviously our main calling that Jesus had for each of us was the care for the poor. And sometimes I think his message was hard to hear because the gospel is hard to hear, but he never would shy away from from saying it, whether people liked it or they didn't.\"\nThe pope's death had impacts on other Christian congregations on the Shore. At the Easton Town Council meeting Monday, the Rev. Elmer Davis, who oversees several Methodist churches and serves on the council, gave some remarks on Francis' death.\n\"I extend my heartfelt condolences and prayers to the Catholic Church and all those who are mourning Pope Francis' death,\" Davis said. \"His passing marks a significant moment in the life of this global Christian community as we recognize the profound impact that he has on countless lives.\n\"Pope Francis was a remarkable leader, whose commitment to love, justice and compassion resonates across all denominational lines. His emphasis on caring for the marginalized, advocating for environment and promoting peace and reconciliation are a powerful reminder of all of our calling in this community.\"\nWhile Nash wants the new pope, who will be selected in the coming weeks, to have original ideas, he hopes the new pope is somewhat like Francis.\n\"He was obviously a bit of a change from what we'd had before,\" Nash said. \"The other popes were wonderful people. I hope the next guy kind of follows suit with him. Just in terms, I'm not looking for anybody that exceeding radical or anything like that, but just someone who's going to continue that reminder to us of our need to be aware of of the needs around us.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Today you need news from different sources\n\n April 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 731\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When Walter Cronkite anchored the CBS Evening News from 1962 until 1981, he closed with \"And that's the way it is.\"His substantial number of viewers readily accepted that conclusion as he was widely considered to be \"the most trusted man in America.\"\nFast forward to today. The media world has changed dramatically and changes constantly.\nThe three legacy national news providers who once had a monopoly on electronic news delivery, now have intense competition from other providers for viewers and for relevance.\nThese providers include, but are not limited to, Fox News, CNN, CNBC, AL Jazeera English, The CW, MSNBC and Blaze Media. They include 24x7 podcasts, radio talk shows, blogs, X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook and countless other social media platforms.\nToday almost every American has access to electronic news outlets whose perspectives on the news range from far left, left of center, far right and right of center. Some of their perspectives (read biases) are subtle, some are thinly disguised, and some are unapologetically obvious.\nSome suggest more media is better.\nThey suggest in an increasingly diverse society, every American is now in a position to follow and support those electronic national news providers whose perspectives on the news most closely matches their own perspectives.\nI agree, but only to a point.\nI suggest too many electronic national news providers are not committed to providing balanced news, especially balanced political news.\nInstead they provide news in a targeted way that affirms what certain viewers already think.\nThat strategy generates a durable collection of viewers for that news provider, which in turn helps recruit and retain advertisers.\nIt does not generate trust.\nTwo months ago, the Gallup Organization released the results of polling Americans trust in the media. This polling exercise has been done regularly by Gallup for over half a century.\nIn this most recent report, Gallup noted that over the past three decades, public confidence in the mass media has collapsed.\nThey also noted Americans' trust in the mass media is at its lowest point in more than five decades.\nTrust levels are down with Republican voters, Democratic voters and unaffiliated voters. These trust levels are even lower than for Congress, the presidency and the U.S. Supreme Court.\nToday, not one national media individual is widely considered as the most trusted news provider in America as was Cronkite.\nWe are dealing with the consequences of William F. Buckley's observation that some people claim to want to give a hearing to other views, but then are shocked and offended to discover there actually are other views.\nAs a result, these people will not even consider following news from media outlets other than those who present news with a perspective that most closely aligns with their own.\nNow more than ever, we owe it to ourselves and to our society, to explore and thoughtfully consider other points of view.\nAt the very least, I suggest if we follow the news from a right of center national media outlet, we take time to follow the news from a comparable left of center national media outlet.\nConversely, I suggest if we follow the news from a national left of center left media outlet, we take time to follow get news from a comparable national right of center media outlet.\nWhen we do that, we must give due consideration to other views and then make thoughtful and informed decisions on our current views.\nUnderstanding and respecting other views is different from accepting them fully or in part.\nIn every case, we can choose to keep our current views, revise them or replace them.\nI further suggest we reject the notion that changing one's mind is a character flaw and accept the notion that changing one's mind is actually a character strength.\nIf or when you do revise or fully reverse your views, expect to be told you are inconsistent.\nIn any event, be true to yourself and stand firm.\nRemember Winston Churchill's guiding principle when he was told he was inconsistent (a regular occurrence in his long and successful life).\nHe said, \"When I consider facts that challenge my current views, I will change my mind and be inconsistent and right, rather than be consistent and wrong.\"\nExcellent advice for all of us especially when we live in a VUCA world, a world with high levels of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity.\nIn such a world, regularly evaluating views with an open mind that may result in a changed mind, is always better than holding on to views with a closed mind. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One was at the Department of Education and the other at Social Security. Neither is yet 60 years of age, but both have worked for decades for their agencies.\nNationally, we are awakening to a nightmare of lawlessness; deportations without due process, tariffs without congressional review, retaliations against law firms and universities, and closure of agencies which monitored the purity of our air, water, food and medications.\nThere are also agencies which supplied hope to people all across the globe (USAID) and truth (Voice of America) that have been decimated by DOGE.\nWho would have imagined that so many members of the Congress and Senate would be afraid to the point of paralysis to speak up about what's happening to our democracy?\nCourage is contagious.\nCory Booker, Bernie Sanders, AOC and a few others can't be the only ones who have loud enough voices to be noticed.

According to The Center for American Progress, the SAVE Act \"would require all Americans to prove their citizenship by presenting documentation in person when registering to vote or updating their voter registration information.\"\nThe center says \"More than 140 million Americans do not possess a passport, and as many as 69 million women, who have taken their spouse's name, do not have a birth certificate matching their legal name. … These women lack citizenship documents showing their original names, because they changed their names after marriage and their birth certificates do not match their current IDs.\"\nThe U.S. League of Women Voters responded to the executive order by filing suit in April. In League of Women Voters v. Trump, a federal court judge has issued a temporary stay \"blocking the U.S. Election Assistance Commission from … adding a requirement to show a passport or similar document proving citizenship when registering to vote. … The injunction preserves the status quo where … voters already affirm under penalty of perjury that they are U.S. citizens.\"\nOne hundred years ago when women rallied for equal voting rights, sashes were often worn by suffragettes during parades, rallies and other events as a way to bring attention to their cause. A simple phrase \"Votes for Women\" drew attention to their message and helped to unify them with each other and their supporters.\nThe colors of the sashes were symbolic — with purple for loyalty, white for purity and gold for light and hope. Through their hard work and persistence, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, giving women the right to vote in elections, passed on Aug. 19, 1920.\nNotably, the League of Women Voters was established in that same year on Feb. 14, 1920. To celebrate the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the League and passage of the 19th Amendment , the Mid-Shore chapter distributed replica sashes to store fronts in Cambridge and Easton. The sashes were made by Cambridge resident Anne McAnulty and lettered by Margaret and George Anzalone.\nNow, after a century, the right of women and other citizens to vote is once again in jeopardy. In response, the League of Women Voters-Mid Shore will resurrect the sashes worn by the suffragettes calling for \"Votes for Women.\"\n\"Now we will proudly wear our sashes in solidarity with those suffragettes and the many others who fought for voting rights, past President Kathi Bangert said. \"As we work in the community to register voters, promote civic education, empower voters and defend democracy, the LWV-Mid Shore members will proudly wear our sashes in support of voting rights.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bradley III who served Talbot County as a county councilman for 29 years. My wife and I are still residents in Maryland. We, like many, look to the lone Republican Congressman, Andy Harris for a voice of sanity and representation.Congressional District 6 (Western Maryland) lost its Republican representation because of gerrymandering to deliberately include non-Western Maryland liberal voters. Maryland is a one-party state. And given the current state administration's views, spending and planned tax increases, there is plenty of reason for Republicans to give up on Maryland. Some even move out of the state.\nBut perhaps nothing is as disheartening as our lone Maryland congressman Harris voting \"present\" on HR1 (\"the one big, beautiful bill\") and using his platform as the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus to not support President Trump, who is the leader of the Republican party. According to his press release, Harris says he voted \"present\" after meeting with Trump.\nSo, now I am asking myself, who does Harris represent? How is he advancing the interests of Maryland conservatives, Delmarva folks, or the national or state Republican party, or even the House Freedom Caucus where most of its members voted to support HR1 after meeting with Trump?\nMy father used to say, \"I have to earn your vote.\"\nI do not see how Congressman Harris is doing this for Congressional District 1 or Talbot Countians. Gerrymandering is one way to lose your voice and representation; another is when an elected representative at any level votes \"present.\"\nCLINTON S.

    "content": "After seven years at Institute of Peace, program specialist faces uncertain future\n\n May 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOLU TALABI Capital News Serviice | Section: Local News \n \n 1561\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n HYATTSVILLE, Md. — The sight of amputated limbs, deserted buildings and roads piled with rubble clung to her.On LaToya's 2006 visit to Monrovia, the Liberian civil wars had left the capital a devastated city.\n\"There was just a lot of destruction,\" she said. \"It looked like a place that used to be developed, but that was no longer existent.\"\nLaToya said the trip kindled her love of helping others and her desire to make the world a better place by fighting for peace, inspiring her to pursue a career that supported the missions of international development.\nLaToya, 35, whose name Capital News Service has withheld at her request to protect her privacy, joined the United States Institute of Peace seven years ago as a program specialist and senior administrative assistant.\nWhen she first walked into the building, LaToya said she instantly felt the passion and dedication of those working for peace, which gave her hope that a world without conflict was possible.\n\"I felt that's where I belonged,\" she told Capital News Service in an interview.\nThen, on March 28, two weeks after LaToya had been working from home, she received her termination letter and a separation agreement form in her personal email because USIP employees had been locked out of their work emails. It was 10 p.m. She was wrapped in the sheets of her bed, watching a reality TV show.\n\"Wow, this is really happening,\" she thought as she scrolled.\nLaToya is among more than 400 institute employees caught up in President Donald Trump's efforts to dismantle the agency. The move was challenged in the courts, triggering a roller coaster ride of setbacks and wins for the employees over the last couple of months.\nLaToya was born to Liberian parents who migrated to the United States in the '80s because of the civil unrest. LaToya spent her 2006 trip visiting orphanages, whose children had lost parents in the wars. She volunteered in elementary school classrooms packed with older students who had missed out on learning because of the wars.\nA Silver Spring, Maryland, native, LaToya eventually pursued a bachelor's degree in sociology and international affairs at American University.\nShe called her work at USIP as being a \"global citizen and impacting your neighbor who is next to you, because when one person is doing well, the better we can all do well.\"\nUSIP works in hostile and conflict-prone territories across the globe to de-escalate and resolve conflict through negotiations. The agency also works to prevent violence before it starts to reduce the need for costly military interventions, according to the institute's former website. The site now says: \"Sorry, you have been blocked. You are unable to access usip.org.\"\nUSIP has worked with 87 countries, providing foreign governments and local communities with training, resources, education and policy recommendations and applying best practices to address violence.\nThe institute has researched religion's role in conflict, worked to stop violent extremism, improve laws and justice, prevent election-related violence, and support good governance and communities living under authoritarian rule.\nUSIP was created by Congress in 1984, following proposals from citizens and World War II combat veterans. It received then-President Ronald Reagan's stamp of approval, and since then has maintained an independent and nonpartisan status. USIP is funded by Congress.\nAt the USIP's distinctive, dome-roofed Washington headquarters, LaToya's workspace was lit by a salt lamp and decorated with green plants and a yarn doll in a colorful tribal dress that her colleague had gifted her.\nMost days, and on some weekends, LaToya logged onto her laptop to plan and coordinate conferences that addressed the issues faced by countries in West Africa and the Sahel region, Europe and Central America. Her tasks included organizing speakers, booking flights, creating event schedules and ensuring that interpreters and the institute's partner organizations involved in peace-building in those countries were paid.\n\"I was working behind the scenes to keep everything running smoothly,\" she said.\nIn 2022, she traveled to Nigeria to help organize a conference centered on improving community security and rebuilding trust between police officers and civilians.\nThe conference allowed the groups to talk and listen to each other, she said. As a result, police officers distributed plastic whistles to residents without access to phones or emergency services. The whistles would be used to alert neighbors and law enforcement about criminal activity. LaToya said that, for the first time, people were comfortable enough to speak directly to law enforcement officials.\n\"It was peace-building in action,\" she said. \"Oftentimes, that is our role, kind of creating a neutral zone for two parties that may be at odds.\"\nBut Latoya knew the Trump administration would come for her job.\nIn January, Trump signed an executive order on in which he said foreign aid did not align with American interests and then issued a 90-day pause on the distribution of assistance funds to foreign countries.\nLaToya explained that some of USIP's projects were funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which delivered food, water and medical aid to people globally and which the executive order targeted.\nUSIP employees whose salaries were tied to USAID-funded projects faced layoffs. While LaToya was having lunch, she saw the workers preparing to leave the building and hugged them goodbye.\nTrump signed another executive order in February on which stated that the USIP, along with three other agencies, was an \"unnecessary governmental entity,\" and that its functions should \"be eliminated to the maximum extent\" and staff should be reduced \"to the minimum presence and function required by law.\"\nLaToya still went about her daily duties in Washington, but she said she was anxious.\nOn March 14, LaToya said she and her colleagues received an email that stated all work would be done from their homes. She said Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had attempted to enter the USIP building, but the institute's security guards turned them away.\nDuring the same month, the Trump administration fired the institute's president, George Moose, along with all of the institute's board members who were appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, according to a lawsuit filed in March by the institute's former president and board members.\nDOGE, the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration, successfully entered the USIP headquarters with the help of the FBI and a key provided by the institute's former security contractor and transferred the institute's privately owned $500 million building to the GSA, according to a litigation filed by USIP employees and the institute's partners in April.\nAfter receiving her termination letter and separation agreement on March 28, LaToya said she rang up her colleagues, who had also been fired, and vented to them. They had received their termination and separation agreement letters alphabetically. The Trump administration fired the majority of the institute's staff, with only about two employees left in finance and human resources in the institute's headquarters, LaToya said.\nShe had up to 60 days to sign the separation agreement form, and she has not yet done so.\nThe agreement guaranteed her a payment of about $4,000 and the continuation of health benefits coverage for one month if she would \"unconditionally release and forever discharge USIP from any and all claims, liabilities, promises, actions, damages … claims of wrongful discharge that USIP or other releasees have treated you unfairly or in bad faith,\" according to the agreement form obtained by CNS.\n\"If you do not sign this agreement, you will not receive the additional payments and benefits,\" the form read. \"The payments are not an admission of any wrongdoing by USIP.\"\nThe form asked LaToya not to disclose the terms within the confidential agreement unless \"with the advance written consent of USIP,\" or as required by law or requested by governmental agencies.\n\"It felt like hush money in a way,\" LaToya said. \"They know the way they're doing things isn't the right way to do things. There should be a process to how things are done.\"\nLaToya could not sleep until 3 a.m. after getting the termination notice. \"It wasn't very restful,\" she said, and even when she woke up, she asked herself, \"Is this real life?\"\nShe filed for unemployment. She was quiet the following days and began experiencing the stages of grief, she said. \"Anger came a little later once I processed everything,\" LaToya said.\nShe found solace in nature and walked through the long trails behind her apartment complex, under the warmth of the sun, as she listened to birds chirping.\nHer husband, with whom she celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary in March, would do the groceries and cook her favorite meals like steak and salmon.\n\"It meant a lot,\" she said.\nShe went to collect her belongings from the USIP headquarters in early April, and a security guard in a fitted white shirt and navy blue trousers escorted her into the building. She said her goodbyes to colleagues, took pictures with them and parted ways.\nOn Monday, as LaToya awoke for an adventurous day in Barbados for her cousin's birthday trip, several messages from her work group chat popped up on her phone.\n\"We won!\" the messages read.\nU.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled on Monday that the Trump administration's takeover of USIP was an usurpation of power and the removal of the institute's president and board members, the termination of staff and the transfer of the institute's building were \"null and void.\"\nThe Justice Department said it plans to appeal the ruling. But the USIP leaders retook possession of their offices on Wednesday.\n\"We don't know what happens next,\" Latoya said, \"but I feel cautiously optimistic.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Andy Harris: 'We are reasonable people'\n\n May 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 734\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the U.S. Congress, there are 461 \"support a cause\" caucuses for members to join, ranging from the Appalachian National Scenic Trail Caucus to the Zoo and Aquarium Caucus.Most are so little known; one would be challenged to name five without a search on Google.\nOne that is well known is the House Republican Freedom Caucus based on their historical adversarial relationship with the House Republican Caucus aka the Republican Conference.\nThe Freedom Caucus is deeply committed to a conservative approach on public policy issues.\nIt is a force to be reckoned with within the House Republican Conference based on the fact that conference has a thin majority requiring almost unanimous party unity to pass bills.\nSince late last year, the House Freedom Caucus chair has been Congressman Andy Harris.\nHarris replaced former Republican Congressman Bob Good who narrowly lost a bid for reelection in a primary election to a challenger endorsed by President Trump.\nGood had a well-deserved reputation as a dogmatic \"my way or the highway\" legislator.\nLike Good, Harris has a strong commitment to the House Freedom Caucus principles.\nUnlike Good, Harris has demonstrated a leadership style reminiscent of former Republican U.S. Senator Everett Dirksen.\nDirksen was a 36-year member of Congress whose served for 10 years as Senate minority leader.\nLike Harris is now, Dirksen then was a strong advocate for conservative fiscal principles, especially on federal government spending and the national debt.\nDirksen was also a pragmatic legislator who understood success in the legislative arena requires practicing the art of the possible, in other words, pursuing accomplishments that may be achieved, rather than pursuing accomplishments that can never be achieved.\nDirksen summed it up perfectly when he said, \"I am a man of principles, and one of them is flexibility.\"\nTo date, Harris has used the Dirksen philosophy in his leadership of the Freedom Caucus.\nFollowing his election as caucus chair, Harris said, \"The best way to advance the conservative agenda is to not be constantly viewed as an obstacle.\"\nAfter a relatively orderly election of Mike Johnson as speaker of the House, Harris said, \"That was an example of how I think we should operate, which is to actually come to an agreement — because, you know, we are reasonable people. Come to agreements. They're not going to be perfect for everybody, but they're going to move us in the right direction.\"\nThat approach has not gone unnoticed by Congressman Dustin Johnson, chair of the House Republicans' Main Street Caucus, a caucus whose members have more moderate views than members of the Freedom Caucus.\nCongressman Johnson, has observed that he \"love[s] working with Andy Harris.\"\nHe also has observed that Harris's predecessor (former Congressman Good), was \"a more difficult personality to get to 'yes.'\"\nA recent example of Andy's leadership philosophy was in full flight was his role in securing support from the Freedom Caucus members in the House for HR 1, a top legislative priority of the Trump administration and described by Trump as a \"big, beautiful bill.\"\nAfter a great deal of contentious debate within the Republican Conference, HR 1 was approved in the full House by a one-vote margin (215 yes votes and 214 no votes).\nEvery Republican House member who voted on HR 1 voted yes with only two exceptions and every Democratic House member who voted on HR 1 voted no.\nNeither of the two Republicans who voted no are members of the Freedom Caucus.\nIn a move that was somewhat surprising, Harris voted present.\nIn a social media post after the vote, he wrote that he did so \"to move the bill along in the process.\"\nWith regard to moving the bill along, there is no certainty when or even if HR 1 will make its way to President Trump for signature into law.\nThere are already indications members of the Republican majority in the Senate may pursue significant revisions to HR 1, and there are rumblings from the Republican majority in the House that anything less than minor Senate changes will result in pushback from the House.\nOne thing that is certain so far is that as House Freedom Caucus chair, Harris has had measurable success to date with the following leadership strategies:\n\"The best way to advance the conservative agenda is to not be constantly viewed as an obstacle.\"\"Come to agreements. They're not going to be perfect for everybody, but they're going to move us in the right direction.\"\nThose strategies should guide future dialogue, deliberation and decisions by the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Officials from both counties and Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) have challenged the designations.\nWhen the list published Thursday, the DHS website stated that the so-called sanctuary jurisdictions are \"defying federal immigration law.\" In April, President Donald Trump issued an executive order instructing DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to track the jurisdictions considered to be defying the president's immigration crackdown efforts.\nAs of Monday, the website doesn't include the list and shows a \"Page Not Found\" error.\nQueen Anne's County officials said in a statement Friday that the sanctuary designation was \"wholly inaccurate.\" Talbot County officials said the county had received no communication from the federal government regarding the designation.\nOn Saturday, Harris released a statement echoing the local pushback to the list.\n\"Although there are Maryland counties and municipalities that unfortunately consider themselves sanctuary jurisdictions (including Baltimore County in the First Congressional District), Queen Annes County and Talbot County are certainly not,\" Harris wrote. \"Our office is actively urging the administration to rectify this designation, freeing up federal resources to appropriately deal with those jurisdictions who refuse to comply with federal immigration law.\"\nOn Sunday, Noem appeared on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo. The host asked Noem about the list.\n\"I saw that there was a list produced,\" Bartiromo said. \"Now the list I don't see anymore in the media. Do you have a list of the sanctuary cities that are actually hiding illegals right now?\"\nNoem did not directly address the list's removal.\n\"Some of the cities have pushed back,\" Noem responded. \"They think because they don't have one law or another on the books, they don't qualify. But they do qualify. They are giving sanctuary to criminals ...\"\nAccording to the Associated Press, a DHS official said the list is constantly under review and can be changed at any time. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Was Biden's health cover-up worse than Watergate?\n\n June 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 646\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In today's 24-7 media coverage of current events in the political world, stories are regularly introduced as \"breaking news with more details to follow.\"That will most certainly be the case after the recent release of the book \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" coauthored by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson.\nNot surprisingly in today's deeply divided society, the reaction to the book has been mixed.\nSome have said elected officials, and their staff lie regularly. They say it is and always has been the way of the world in which we live.\nIt has also been said that the public should not be surprised or upset when details emerge on behavior by elected and appointed government that is illegal or unethical.\nOthers have said illegal and unethical behavior is never acceptable.\nThey say the media has an obligation to report it, and those who engage in such behavior must be held accountable and punished to the maximum extent of the law.\nSome have said, while such behavior is bipartisan, more often than not, it is overlooked or excused by some of the national media when it involves Democratic presidents.\nThey cite the levels of reporting by the national media on Bill Clinton's involvement with Monica Lewinsky, compared to Richard Nixon's involvement with Watergate.\nUntil recently, Nixon has been almost universally viewed as the least ethical and least honest president in U.S. history.\nJohn Kass, a former Chicago Tribune political reporter and columnist has challenged that view by writing \"… this one about Biden is much worse than the Watergate break-in. In that one the White House covered up the lawbreaking and the media uncovered it.\"\nEven Jake Tapper has suggested that may be true in saying publicly, the \"cover-up of the former president's mental decline may be a worse scandal than Watergate.\"\nWith that in mind, Congressional investigations are already underway on Biden's levels of awareness of and involvement on decisions made during his presidency.\nMore are likely to come.\nIt will be most interesting to learn answers given under oath to three questions:\nWas there at any point during the Biden presidency, when, as a result of Biden's physical and mental health conditions, decisions that are the exclusive responsibility of an elected president were instead made by an individual or individuals other than the elected President?\nIf so and perhaps without President Biden being aware of it, did these individuals break the law, that is, by using autopen signatures on executive orders and pardons?\nWas the media complicit if they ignored or did not follow-up with due diligence on these matters?\nOther questions will not be answered until next year's midterm elections.\nHow many decisions were made by voters based on their support for or opposition to President Trump's agenda?\nHow many decisions were made on whether or not there was conclusive evidence of a coverup of President Biden's levels of engagement during all four years of his presidency?\nWill the latter reflect an increasing loss of voter confidence in national news media outlets?\nThere are already signs of significant loss in that confidence in some of the national media.\nTapper's own CNN show had its lowest-rated month since August 2015. That should put every member of the news division of the national media on notice.\nThere are measurable and profound consequences on ignoring and disrespecting what Americans expect from national political news providers.\nGoing forward, American voters deserve three things from the national media.\nFact-based news with no hidden agendas.\nVigorous pursuit and continuous exposure of verifiable unethical and/or illegal behavior by every elected and appointed government official.\nNo group think — a psychological phenomenon when conclusions are not the result of a lack of information, but because of a conscious decision to put conformity above critical thinking.\nUntil that happens, all the excuses and explanations from the national media who failed to do their job during the Biden presidential years will be nothing more than too little, too late. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Expectations were all three would endorse Kamala Harris in 2024. It did not happen.\nOnly The New York Times endorsed Harris.\nThe Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times did not endorse Harris or Trump.\nIn the case with The Washington Post, publisher Will Lewis announced a new no presidential endorsements policy at the Post, not only for the 2024 presidential general election but for future presidential general elections.\nIn announcing the new policy Lewis said, \"We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another or as an abdication of responsibility. That is inevitable. We don't see it that way. We see as a statement in support of our readers' ability to make up their own minds on this, the most consequential of American decisions — whom to vote for as the next president. I am very excited about this new clarity and transparency and cannot wait to see it brought to life in our opinion section. Every Day.\"\nHe also wrote in a memo to the staff at the Post: \"This is not about siding with any political party. This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper. Doing this is a critical part of serving as a premier news publication across America and for all Americans.\"\nThe Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who purchased the Washington Post after it was owned by the Meyer-Graham family for over 80 years, also recently wrote in a memo to Post employees.\n\"We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,\" he wrote. \"We'll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\"\nBezos also wrote: \"There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader's doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job.\"\nIn the case of The Los Angeles Times, Dr. Patrick Soon Shiong, a surgeon and entrepreneur who has been is the owner and executive chair of the paper since 2018, asked the editorial board to do a factual analysis of the policies of Harris and those of Trump during his first term.\nHe also asked them to provide their understanding of the policies and plans of Trump and Harris that they presented during this campaign and its potential effect on the nation in the next four years.\nHe wrote, \"In this way, with this clear and non-partisan information side-by-side, our readers could decide who would be worthy of being president for the next four years.\"\nHe noted the board \"chose to remain silent, and I accepted their decision.\"\nGoing forward, it will be most interesting to see what The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times decide on their policies with regard to presidential general election endorsements in the 2028 election cycle.\nI predict The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times will maintain their most recent policy decisions and will not make general election endorsements in that election cycle.\nI also predict The New York Times will maintain their most recent policy decision and will make general election endorsements in that election cycle.\nFor now, all I can write with certainty is they all have the power and a demonstrated willingness to retain or change their endorsement policies at any time for any reason.\nThat said, always expect the unexpected in the political arena. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Easton resident said he's gravely worried for the future of his family.\n\"This world is coming to a crumble,\" Stanford said. He added that the landscape of the current federal administration is the \"worst I've ever seen it.\"\nHundreds of local residents like Stanford lined Dover Street on Saturday morning as part of Easton's \"No Kings\" protest, one of thousands of demonstrations across the nation to object President Donald Trump and his actions since taking office in January.\nThe protests, promoted as peaceful, were coordinated by an extensive network of progressive organizations to coincide with a military parade hosted by Trump in honor of the Army's 250th birthday.\nIn Easton, protesters staged from the corner of Dover Road and Route 50 down the Dover Street sidewalk to the corner of South Harrison Street. They received frequent honks of support from vehicles passing by. A handful of drivers and passengers contested the protesters verbally, though no major incidents occurred and there was largely no police presence.\nTalbot County Democratic Central Committee members Justin Butler and Jair Devereaux led parts of the protests and engaged crowded sidewalks of protesters in chants.\nPhil Jackson, chair of the Democratic committee, said in a written statement that the \"No Kings\" theme rejects authoritarianism and defends democracy.\n\"Talbot County knows its history — we've seen what happens when silence replaces action,\" Jackson wrote. \"Today, we chose action. With over 500 people lining E. Dover Street, peacefully protesting, it's a clear and emphatic rejection of strongman politics, dynastic privilege, and the erosion of our democracy.\"\nMany protestors cited concerns about cuts to Medicaid and Trump's continued immigration crackdown efforts as their motivation for attending.\nOne Easton resident named Steve, who declined to provide his last name, said he's particularly upset about the administration's actions against immigrants and diversity, equity and inclusion policies.\n\"They're still chasing the American Dream, whether it exists or not,\" he said of the nation's immigrants.\nRoseann Newell, an Easton resident of more than 40 years, said she had every reason to come out and protest the Trump administration.\n\"What didn't bring me out today?\" Newell asked.\nSt. Michaels resident Paulette Florio said there's a \"government of tragedy happening.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Protesters expressed their dissatisfaction with the Trump administration's mass deportations, federal budget cuts and isolationist attitude.As Bob Dylan's \"Hurricane\" played in the background, resident Bruce Bernard said he joined the protest in Cambridge on Saturday because he is \"disgusted.\"\n\"We've elected people that are more interested in their position, in their power, than doing the right thing for America,\" Bernard said.\nOver 2,000 \"No Kings\" demonstrations were held on Saturday across the country.\nAround 200 people showed up for the 4 p.m. protest in Cambridge, located on the grassy area off Maryland Avenue just entering the city over the Choptank River. A majority of demonstrators were previously at the \"No Kings\" demonstration in Easton, which was held earlier Saturday.\nThe peaceful protesters lined Maryland Avenue as encouraging drivers honked in support. Protesters bore signs that read, \"I.C.E. needs to melt. Take off your masks,\" \"No kings, no war, no bombs, no AIPAC, no genocide,\" \"TACO king,\" and \"you took an oath.\"\nFor several individuals in attendance, like Kendra Fontaine, Kirby Kinnamon and Kinnamon's son, Gregor Adams, it was their first protest ever. Kinnoman said it is important to keep oneself educated and that she and Gregor sit down to talk about politics often.\n\"He's my little justice warrior,\" she said.\nRoughly an hour in, six counter-protesters arrived across the street waving \"Trump 2024\" flags. Protesters on both side remained respectful.\n\"I came out not just because of Trump. Today's Flag Day. We're just honoring America,\" said resident Ben Doyle, one of the counter-protesters.\nDoyle said when they first arrived, they were called racist and other \"not so nice things,\" but he said he understands everyone has freedom of speech. Counter-protesters said it was disappointing to see signs that called Trump bad names.\n\"I'm sad that they're so misguided, but when you're paid to protest, that's why you get so many people,\" said counter-protester Patrick Ferguson. Ferguson said Cambridge Indivisible paid protesters to demonstrate, echoing sentiments expressed about protesters earlier this year.\nAfter a protest held against Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) in March, Harris said he believed protesters were being paid and brought in by busses.\nCambridge Indivisible Co-founder and Co-Chair Michelle Fowle denied these allegations, saying many at the rally in March were her neighbors and friends who are local to Cambridge.\n\"We don't get paid. We protest fascism for free,\" Fowle said in an interview Monday. \"I think a lot of it is projection.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "AI's potential benefits are extraordinary, but so are downsides\n\n June 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MICHAEL DAVIS | Section: Columns \n \n 841\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Buried in the 1,038 pages of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a dangerous clause that prohibits any state from regulating artificial intelligence for 10 years. Even Marjorie Taylor Greene is against it, as well as other Republicans: Sens. Blackburn (R-Tenn), Tillis (R-NC), Hawley (R-Missouri), Rounds (R-SD) and Young (R-Ind.).Recently, Trump rescinded federal regulatory controls on AI that were imposed by a Biden executive order. Because language in the budget bill goes further and eliminate all state regulation of AI for 10 years, this would leave an AI regulatory vacuum with only Trump in a position to regulate AI by executive order or by initiating federal legislation.\nAI involves making and spending hundreds of billions of dollars. The company that developed ChatGPT-4, OpenAI, is valued at $300 billion, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world. Anthropic, a relatively small AI company that developed Claude.ai is worth $60 billion. Other companies involved in AI are Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Google. Microsoft invested $13 billion with OpenAI. Trump recently announced a $500 billion private investment in AI infrastructure.\nAI's potential benefits are extraordinary. There are also serious concerns about predictable negative consequences if there is no government oversight at the federal or state level. One major concern about AI is how the companies creating AI programs have exploited people and physical resources. The companies have a disgraceful history of hiring impoverished people in Africa and Venezuela to review the worst images posted on the internet so these AI companies can block the images from the rest of us.\nAnother concern is how AI contributes to energy and land exploitation. Trump brags about the $500 billion private investment in AI infrastructure that will start this year. Unregulated, AI requires massive amounts of electricity to power computers in data centers. Even before Trump announced the $500 billion in infrastructure for AI, designs were underway for data centers requiring as much power as is needed to run two to three cities as large as San Francisco.\nOne gross estimate is that by 2030 8% of all electricity generated in the U.S. will be used for AI. There is no national planning underway for managing that new power load.\nData centers also require vast quantiles of fresh water to prevent overheating. The supply of freshwater in the world is plummeting to critical levels due to shifting weather patterns, growing needs by agriculture, industrial pollution and saltwater incursion. In 2022, Google was designing a data center in Chile that was going to use several million gallons of fresh water every day — enough for tens of thousands of families. The Chilean government intervened to stop the project.\nAI companies aggressively hide the data about environmental exploitation. Independent researchers are banned from company sites. In-house researchers are prevented from publishing data on the environmental impact of AI. They also project rosy scenarios that have not happened, such as claiming AI will solve climate change. But the environmental damage by data centers will happen long before those fixes are, if ever, in place.\nThe unaddressed impact of AI on employment is huge. One AI executive predicted that by 2030, AI will be able to do every entry-level white-collar job. Under this scenario the unemployment rate will be as high as 20%. Companies will no longer need to hire new medical diagnosticians, engineers, computer programmers, business managers, research scientists, writers, artists, accountants, musicians, and so on. That will be a disaster even if it takes twice as long for AI, say 10 years, to achieve this.\nOur own Andy Harris should worry. Today there are AI-programmed anesthesiology machines that could easily put him out of work. Those machines are not used on humans only due to Federal Drug Adminsitration (FDA) regulation.\nIn its short life, AI has a controversial history. AI programs have created graphic child pornography in texts and pictures, created deep fakes, written Nazi propaganda, created propaganda that influenced elections around the world and convinced several people to kill themselves. Even more alarming, this year an AI program spontaneously wrote code to prevent someone from turning it off.\nThe AI companies don't want their programs used for these abuses, but they have not been able to stop it. The companies have set up internal safety organizations with a mixed record of successful control. In March 2023, industry leaders in AI issued an open letter saying all progress on AI should stop for six months to give governments time to develop regulations. Over 13,500 programmers cosigned the letter. The pause did not happen.\nThere is essentially no government regulation of AI, but states could jump in and protect against AI abuses. The provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, if the Senate accepts it, would prevent state regulation for a decade, leaving Trump with immense and exclusive power. This doomsday scenario is not fear mongering. It is playing out in real time. In the history of the world, no profound technology has ever been so quickly introduced with no institutional guardrails whatsoever. Politics aside, AI regulation is necessary to protect the common good. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The Voice provided people under Nazi domination a way to hear the truth about World War II. The Voice provided the first real notification of D-Day, the invasion of Nazi controlled Europe and, thereby, triggered partisan uprisings all over Europe.After World War II and during the Cold War the Voice of America expanded its efforts to fight communism and played a role in the decline of communism in several countries. Today the Voice of America provides digital and radio content in 48 languages for affiliate stations around the world. The target and primary audience for the broadcasts is non-Americans living outside the United States borders, especially those without a free press or independent journalism.\nIt is the voice of freedom for them.\nNational Public Radio or NPR is an American public broadcasting organization that serves as a national syndicator to a network of more than a thousand public radio stations in the United States. NPR caters to local stories and news, local foods, local history, local culture and local dance. Classical and jazz music is played on NPR stations around the country. Programs like \"Kids, screen time and mental health\" might be a topic.\nThe Public Broadcasting Service or PBS is a publicly funded nonprofit organization and the most prominent provider of educational programs to public television stations in the United States. Some of the programs we have all enjoyed include NOVA, Frontline, Masterpiece Theater, Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, Barney and Friends, American Experience and the most popular, Downton Abby.\nThese well-known and in most cases revered broadcast organizations are and have been a part of our lives for many decades. They have given all of us good things to entertain us, good things to think about and unbiased information. In the case of Voice of America, it has been our only way to reach places like Russia with the truth about world events like the war in Ukraine.\nMr. Putin is no doubt breaking out the vodka to celebrate this gift from Trump.\nAll these well-known and revered broadcast organizations are under fire from Mr. Trump to be cut off from any support that has come from the federal government. Wny is this being done? VOA, NPR and PBS all support us, the make our lives a little better, they give us a voice to reach other people.\nI urge all of you to support VOA, NPR and PBS by letting our elected representatives know that you do not agree with ending this contribution to our lives. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Judge rules Trump can't hold up transportation funds over immigration\n\n June 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: National \n \n 643\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BOSTON — A federal judge on Thursday blocked the Trump administration from withholding billions of dollars in transportation funds from states that don't agree to participate in some immigration enforcement actions.Twenty states sued after they said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy threatened to cut off funding to states that refused to comply with President Donald Trump's immigration agenda. U.S. District Judge John McConnell Jr. barred federal transportation officials from carrying out that threat before the lawsuit is fully resolved.\n\"The Court finds that the States have demonstrated they will face irreparable and continuing harm if forced to agree to Defendants' unlawful and unconstitutional immigration conditions imposed in order to receive federal transportation grant funds,\" wrote McConnell, the chief judge for the federal district of Rhode island. \"The States face losing billions of dollars in federal funding, are being put in a position of relinquishing their sovereign right to decide how to use their own police officers, are at risk of losing the trust built between local law enforcement and immigrant communities, and will have to scale back, reconsider, or cancel ongoing transportation projects.\"\nThe Talbot County Council voted this month to remove the diversity, equity and inclusion statement from the county's employee handbook, reversing course from March, when the council upheld the diversity statement.\nThe local decision came amid concerns for millions of dollars in federal funding for an ongoing Easton Airport project. Those worries stem from an April directive from Duffy outlining the Trump administration's view that DEI programs violate federal law.\nMassachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell, in a statement posted on Bluesky, welcomed the ruling.\n\"The court granted a temporary order halting the Trump administration's attempt to hold critical funding for states if they don't comply with their cruel immigration policies,\" Campbell said. This would have put critical funding for transportation in MA at risk. It's not just wrong — it's illegal.\"\nIn statement posted on X, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said the ruling wasn't surprising.\n\"I directed states who want federal DOT money to comply with federal immigration laws,\" Duffy said. \"But, no surprise, an Obama-appointed judge has ruled that states can openly defy our federal immigration laws. This is judicial activism pure and simple and I will continue to fight in the courts.\"\nOn April 24, states received letters from the Department of Transportation stating that they must cooperate on immigration efforts or risk losing the congressionally appropriated funds. No funding was immediately withheld, but some of the states feared the move was imminent.\nAttorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont filed the lawsuit in May, saying the new so-called \"Duffy Directive\" put them in an impossible position.\n\"The States can either attempt to comply with an unlawful and unconstitutional condition that would surrender their sovereign control over their own law enforcement officers and reduce immigrants' willingness to report crimes and participate in public health programs — or they can forfeit tens of billions of dollars of funds they rely on regularly to support the roads, highways, railways, airways, ferries, and bridges that connect their communities and homes,\" the attorneys general wrote in court documents.\nBut acting Rhode Island U.S. Attorney Sara Miron Bloom told the judge that Congress has given the Department of Transportation the legal right to set conditions for the grant money it administers to states, and that requiring compliance and cooperation with federal law enforcement is a reasonable exercise of that discretion. Allowing the federal government to withhold the funds while the lawsuit moves forward doesn't cause any lasting harm, Bloom wrote in court documents, because that money can always be disbursed later if needed.\nBut requiring the federal government to release the money to uncooperative states will likely make it impossible to recoup later, if the Department of Transportation wins the case, Bloom said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Immigration is winning issue for Republicans\n\n June 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 736\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In an increasingly polarized America, one public policy issue with decades of unresolved and widely divergent opinions has been southern border immigration into America.On one side are those who feel strongly that deportations of every immigrant who has not followed long established, but not enforced immigration laws, are long overdue, necessary and proper.\nOn the other side are those who feel strongly that mass deportations of southern border immigrants who have not earned legal immigration status is not feasible, needed or proper.\nOne thing is irrefutable.\nSouthern border immigration was a huge issue, if not the issue in the 2024 presidential and congressional elections, when Donald Trump won the presidency for a second nonconsecutive term and Republicans secured majorities in both houses of Congress.\nRecently, Harry Enten, chief data analyst at left of center CNN, did a deep dive on the current state of this issue during the height of the protests in Los Angeles.\nThe Columbia Journalism Review calls Enten \"a new generation of political journalists focusing on data-driven journalism instead of reporting from the campaign trail.\"\nEnten has reported that no group has moved more sharply to the right on immigration than southern border immigrants who went through the long and arduous process to become an American citizen.\nThey followed the rules and waited patiently for the process to be done. They filled out forms, took citizenship tests, paid fees and often spent years separated from family while following U.S. immigration law to the letter.\nAccording to Enten, since 2020 this group of immigrants has shifted its partisan allegiance toward Republicans by a large margin.\nIn 2020, Democrats held a 32-point lead among these voters on the issue of who best to address southern border immigration issues.\nToday, Republicans are up by a 40-point lead resulting in Enten concluding bluntly, \"This group of voters in the American electorate believes that \"the Democrats don't have a clue on the issue of immigration.\"\nEnten also suggests, \"Trump is begging for a fight on this because he knows what he's doing so far is working with the American electorate. There is no issue on which Trump is doing so much better than he was in his first term, more than the issue of immigration.\"\nEnten maintained other polls affirm his conclusions. He cites comparable results from CBS and from Ipsos, a multinational research firm headquartered in Paris.\nEnten says, \"No matter what poll you look at, no matter which way you cut it, the American public is with the Republicans. The American public is with Trump.\"\nNot necessarily and certainly not guaranteed for the long term.\nIn reviewing survey results, one must remember they are a snapshot at a given point in time.\nAmerican voters are often inconsistent and are always unpredictable. Their views on any and all public policy issues are subject to change dramatically.\nAfter relatively peaceful nationwide \"No King\" protests, right of center Fox News engaged Daron Shaw, a Republican pollster, and Chris Anderson, a Democratic pollster, for a survey.\nTheir survey results included an unexpected shift by unaffiliated (independent) voters on the issue of widely publicized ongoing searches for illegal immigrants led by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.\nThose unaffiliated voters are now expressing concern that ICE efforts are \"heavy-handed and cast the deportment net too broadly\".\nAs I write this, there is breaking news on American military action in Iran.\nThat will have a profound impact on the results of any future current events polling results, regardless of who conducts the surveys.\nFor now, the range of issues and their current interest intensity by respondents to the Shaw and Anderson polling are:\n85% of the survey respondents were extremely or very concerned about the future of America.\n84% of the survey respondents were extremely or very concerned about inflation.\n80% of the survey respondents were extremely or very concerned about government spending.\n78% of the survey respondents were extremely or very concerned about Iran.\n69% of the survey respondents were extremely or very concerned about antisemitism.\n67% of the survey respondents were extremely or very concerned about immigration.\nThe mid-term general elections are less than 18 months from now.\nIt will be interesting to see which issues, if any of the above or new ones yet to emerge, will have the greatest impact on voter views, turnout and choices in the midterm elections.\nDonald Trump will not be on the ballot, but midterm voters will decide party control of the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate during the last two years of the Trump administration. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

HERSHEY Stars and Stripes | Section: Real Estate \n \n 691\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Legislation that creates a safety net for thousands of veterans facing foreclosure with delinquent home mortgages now moves to the president's desk for his signature after passing the Senate.The VA Home Loan Program Reform Act, which was adopted by the Senate with a voice vote late Tuesday, establishes a partial claim program that allows veterans who are behind on home loan payments to receive federal assistance.\nA companion bill in the House was adopted by voice vote in May.\nThe bill authorizes the VA to purchase a portion of the debt on veterans loans in default or at imminent risk of default, according to the legislation.\nThe mortgage industry estimates more than 20,000 current borrowers are considered seriously delinquent and a partial claim program at the VA could help them retain their homes, lawmakers said. The goal is to help veterans catch up on payments and prevent foreclosure, they said.\n\"First, the bill authorizes the VA to pay the holder of a loan guaranteed by the VA an amount necessary to avoid the foreclosure of the loan, provided that the holder of the loan and the veteran obligated on the loan execute documents to ensure the VA obtains a secured interest in the property covered by the loan,\" according to the bill.\nLeaders from the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs committees released a joint statement after the Senate passed the bill.\n\"This bipartisan and bicameral legislation will assist veterans who are facing financial hardships and provide VA with a tool to better help veterans stay in their homes and avoid foreclosure. The VA Home Loan Program provides one of the best benefits VA has to offer and has helped veterans and their families build home equity since its inception in 1944,\" according to the joint statement.\nThe VA home loan program was created under The Servicemen's Readjustment Act, which became known as the GI Bill. More than 3.7 million veterans hold active home loans guaranteed by the VA, according to the agency.\nSen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the committee's top Democrat, offered the formal remarks after Senate adoption.\nOn the House side, Rep. Mike Bost, R-Ill., chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and Rep. Mark Takano of California, the top Democrat on the committee, included their names on the statement.\n\"This legislation will ensure these veterans have a viable solution to avoid defaulting on their loans, bring their mortgages current, and avoid foreclosure by establishing a replacement partial claims program,\" the lawmakers said.\nThe partial claims program replaces the Veterans Affairs Servicing Program, which was described as a \"last-resort option\" for delinquent borrowers to lower their mortgage rate and make their monthly payments more affordable.\nUnder that program, the VA bought the mortgage from the servicer.\nBut the program permanently closed May 1, after Republican lawmakers complained the VA should not be in the business of buying home mortgages. They argued some veterans might intentionally fall behind on their payments to get a lower mortgage rate from the VA.\n\"My focus is to ensure that veterans remain in their homes whenever possible,\" said Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis. \"But I am concerned that this program could evolve into a financial burden of billions of dollars in bailouts that fall on the shoulders of taxpayers.\"\nVan Orden introduced the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act in the House for a partial claim program to allow veterans to catch up with their overdue mortgage payments while keeping the original loan.\nUnder the partial claim program, veterans facing financial hardship can defer missed payments without immediately facing foreclosure, Van Orden said.\nThe VA Home Loan Program Reform Act received support from lenders and other stakeholders, including the Mortgage Bankers Association, the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion.\n\"We encourage the VA and mortgage servicers to continue their collaboration as this program is implemented, ensuring that they help mitigate any impact on veterans facing financial hardship while VA takes the necessary steps to establish the new partial claims program properly,\" lawmakers said in the joint statement.\n© 2025 the Stars and Stripes.

According to his daughter, Clarissa Fuentes Diaz, Espinal, who also does construction work, was arrested by ICE agents early Monday morning after stopping by Lowe's to pick up material for a job site.\nICE confirmed Espinal's arrest in a statement to the Star Democrat Thursday.\n\"Daniel Omar Fuentes Espinal is an illegal alien from Honduras who was arrested by ICE on July 21, in Easton, Maryland,\" the statement read. \"Fuentes entered the United States on a 6-month visa and never left in 24 years. It is a federal crime to overstay the authorized period of time granted under a visitors visa.\"\nDiaz said Espinal had no other criminal history. She said the family is working with an immigration attorney, but access to and information about Espinal is limited other than occasional 20-minute phone calls, which cost $50.\nAccording to Diaz, her father has not had access to his medications and is sleeping on a concrete floor in the ICE detention center. She said he has been helping other detainees by preaching, praying and giving them faith.\nMembers of the Mid-Shore community have organized efforts in support of Espinal in the wake of the arrest.\nTred Avon Strategies principal Len Foxwell created a GoFundMe with a goal of $15,000 to support Espinal's growing legal fees and help cover costs for Espinal's wife and three children during his absence.\nFoxwell's son, who recently died in a car accident, was best friends with Espinal's son.\nThe GoFundMe, created Thursday morning, was more than halfway toward its goal as of 4 p.m. Thursday.\nThe Talbot Democratic Forum and the Talbot Democratic Central Committee plan to hold a rally on Friday from 5:30 to 7 p.m. on Route 50 and Dover Road in Easton to demand Espinal's immediate release from ICE custody.\n\"Pastor Daniel Fuentes Espinal was ripped from his family and congregation by ICE with no warning. He has no criminal record. He's a father, a faith leader, and a vital part of our Eastern Shore community,\" Cambridge Indivisible wrote in a Facebook post promoting the rally.\nDemocratic politicians from throughout the state are also calling for Espinal's release.\n\"The Trump Administration clearly isn't targeting the most dangerous criminals living in the U.S. illegally — they are snatching up anyone they can find as they pursue their mass deportation agenda and terrorizing our communities in the process. My team is engaged with Pastor Espinal's family and I will be monitoring this closely,\" U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen said in a statement to the Star Democrat.\nRep. Andy Harris (R-Md. 1st), whose district includes Easton, said in a statement to the Star Democrat that he was aware of Espinal's situation but did not have the specifics of the case.\n\"Congressman Harris believes due process within the immigration system is important and that facts should be clear before making any further public comment,\" the statement said. \"More broadly, Rep. Harris has always believed that any immigration enforcement action taken should be based on accurate information and lawful immigration adjudication processes.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "An anti-science, anti-intellectual cleansing\n\n July 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MEL GURTOV | Section: Columns \n \n 793\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n There was a time not too long ago when American scientists and American research facilities were the envy of the world. In those days, our scientists typically swept Nobel and other international prizes. Not anymore; the Trump administration's drastic cuts in scientific personnel and budgets will \"essentially end America's longstanding role as the world leader in science and innovation,\" said Toby Smith, senior vice president for government relations and public policy at the Association of American Universities.The results are clear: As two economists recently wrote, in cutting-edge scientific research, whereas in 2017 the US led China in eight categories, by 2023, it led in only one, quantum computing.\nWe sometimes forget how important government-supported scientific research at university and other laboratories is in ordinary life. One study mentions as examples, \"lifesaving medicine, commercial agriculture and virtual communication. ... Of the 356 new drugs approved over the past decade, 354 received funding from the National Institutes of Health, the world's largest supporter of biomedical research.\"\nThe smartphone, computers and highways are other examples. The U.S. economy greatly benefits. As Karin Fischer writes in the Chronicle of Higher Education, \"A paper published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found that government spending on research and development has spurred at least a fifth of U.S. productivity growth since World War II.\" Yes, government-supported classified research underpins the military-industrial complex. Such spending contrasts with open, scientist-determined research in the public interest, with the government's role that of a distant funder.\nPOLITICALLY DRIVEN CUTS\nThe Trump administration has fundamentally changed independent research. It has become the \"minder\" of research programs in and outside government, much like a ministry in an authoritarian country. It is now impossible to get federal funding that supports research related to DEI, LGBTQ+ rights and climate change. Mere mention of those topics in National Science Foundation grant applications, over which DOGE presides, has ruled them out.\nThe Guardian has found that \"at least 1,653 active NSF research grants authorized on their merits have so far been abruptly cancelled.\" Scientists who don't agree with Trump's political agenda are being forced out — at Health and Human Services, for instance, where RFK Jr. has fired immunization scientists who disagree with his vaccination stance. The science program at the Environmental Protection Agency has just been dismantled.\nLeadership of key public health agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Food and Drug Administration, is in the hands of medical quacks. Karin Fischer, an educational researcher, reports further: \"The administration said it would stop underwriting scientific collaboration with overseas partners, and stepped up scrutiny of research contracts and other funds to colleges from foreign sources.\"\nMaking these determinations is a one-way street: Trump isn't negotiating new terms of collaboration; he's ordering them. For instance: Trump has ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to remove references to the climate crisis from its website; blocked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from publishing scientific information on the threat of bird flu to humans; fired senior leaders at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and cut about 1,000 jobs, with the Texas flood disaster one consequence; fired around 800 people at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, putting critical weather forecasting in a bind; and greatly reduced funds for investment in low-carbon technologies, despite the fact that those funds go overwhelmingly to Republican districts.\nANTI-SCIENCE, ANTI-EARTH\nThe Guardian offers an example of what happens to politically unacceptable research under Trump: Although Congress mandates that climate assessments be prepared every four years, the Trump administration has eliminated the online portal for the reports, according to The Guardian, which notes that researchers who were working on the next report, due around 2027, have been dismissed.\nThe Guardian was able to provide a copy of the latest assessment, conducted in 2023. It warns that the \"effects of human-caused climate change are already far-reaching and worsening across every region of the United States.\" \"Without rapid and deep reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions from human activities,\" the assessment continues, \"the risks of accelerating sea level rise, intensifying extreme weather and other harmful climate impacts will continue to grow.\" Such a conclusion is an anathema to a regime that is dedicated to the interests of the fossil fuel industry.\nThanks largely to Trump, America's scientific talent is now for sale. France, Japan, Australia, and the Netherlands are among the countries that are hiring away U.S. scientists. China has succeeded in luring back many scientists in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) who had hoped for careers in the U.S. Those students and researchers still in the U.S. are now regarded, not as assets but as political suspects.\nWhat we are witnessing, in short, is an anti-science, anti-intellectual cleansing that will cause immense harm to public health, the economy, education and America's reputation. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dead air: Lifeline or death knell for AM radio?\n\n July 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Adams MultiMedia | Section: National \n \n 1402\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n AM radio harkens back to bygone eras. But could the old-time radio dial also be mothballed and silenced?Automakers continue to look at discontinuing offering AM radios in vehicles as podcasts, online platforms and social media challenge traditional mediums and airwaves.\nA coalition of broadcasters, radio station owners and lawmakers from both major political parties are pushing for a federal bill to require automakers to keep AM radio offerings in vehicles. They see the issue as key to AM radio's survival.\nThere are more than 300 co-sponsors of the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act of 2025 being considered by Congress. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) and AARP back legislation requiring AM radios in cars.\nBackers say keeping AM radios in cars is essential for the communications medium's survival. They worry about the financial viability of AM stations if their shows, music and advertising are not available in cars.\n\"It will destroy AM radio,\" said Lauren Fix, an automotive industry analyst with Buffalo-based Car Coach Reports.\nShe said local AM radio stations provide emergency, public safety and breaking-news information in many rural areas, small towns and underserved communities, including those where people speak languages other than English.\n\"The truth is it will hurt local communities,\" Fix said of the void for local news, local business advertising and local jobs if AM stations decline.\nThere are more than 4,400 AM stations in the U.S. Many of them are in small towns and rural areas with fewer local media options than larger markets. The AM radio dial includes a significant number of Christian stations and programming.\nFix said some carmakers have looked at taking out AM radios to reduce production costs.\nAM radio requires some insulation in vehicles because of electromagnetic interference from fuel injection systems.\nSome automakers point to interference between AM radios and electric vehicles.\n\"The main reason some automakers are considering dropping AM radio, especially in electric vehicles, is due to the electromagnetic interference caused by the electric motors and power systems in these cars. The frequencies at which EV components operate can disrupt the AM signal, making it harder to deliver clear audio without major technical workarounds,\" said Scott Kunes, COO of Kunes Auto and RV Group, which operates car and RV dealerships in Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota and Iowa.\n\"While it's a solvable engineering problem, not all manufacturers are willing to invest in the added cost and complexity. Several automakers, including Tesla, BMW and Volvo, have already removed AM radios from certain EV models. Ford initially planned to follow suit, but reversed course after hearing from lawmakers, broadcasters and consumers,\" he said.\nFix says ditching AM radio is all about shaving manufacturing costs and that terrestrial radio does not offer revenue streams for automakers unlike satellite and digital platforms. \"They don't make money off of it,\" she said.\nKunes is also concerned about the local impacts if AM radios are ditched from cars.\n\"We serve a lot of small towns and rural communities, and for many of our customers, AM radio isn't just background noise. It's how they get storm warnings, market updates, local news and community programming,\" Kunes said.\n\"There's a misconception that AM radio is outdated, but in places where cell service drops and broadband doesn't reach, it's still mission-critical. Removing AM from vehicles risks disconnecting entire communities that depend on it,\" Kunes said\nRadio broadcasters agree.\nNRB, NAB and other groups are lobbying federal lawmakers in support of the AM radio legislation in both chambers of Congress.\nNRB President and CEO Troy Miller worries about media conglomerates and car manufacturers muffling religious and other AM radio voices.\n\"Radio's free, ubiquitous signal puts community updates, civic dialogue, and the Gospel within easy reach for the everyday American, bridging economic and social divides newer media often miss,\" Miller said.\nThe AM Radio in Every Car Act was previously introduced in 2023. Fix is optimistic about its potential for passage this year, stressing its importance for local audiences, including local churches.\n\"A lot of churches use it as well, because FM is more expensive,\" Fix said.\nAARP Senior Vice President Bill Sweeney wrote members of Congress earlier this year to stress the importance of AM radio for older Americans and for emergency notifications.\n\"Adults age 50 and above represent the largest share of AM radio listeners. They also represent those most at risk from disaster events. In these situations, AM radio is a critical element of the emergency response system,\" Sweeney said.\n\"Older people need all possible channels of communication available to them to ensure their safety. The importance of AM radio was expressed in a letter from seven former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administrators last year who stated that AM radio serves as a linchpin of the infrastructure behind the federal National Public Warning System. According to FEMA, more than 75 radio stations, most of which operate on the AM band and cover at least 90 percent of the U.S. population, are equipped with backup communications equipment and generators that allow them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an emergency,\" Sweeney continued.\nAM radio has been challenged by changing consumer tastes and other entertainment options. There are some markets where there are still AM news stations. The medium also sees religious programming, sports talk, conservative talk and cultural stations that broadcast in Spanish and other languages.\nAM radio draws 82 million listeners monthly, according to NAB. AM listeners tends to be older, according various analyses. The media landscape has changed from the days of Rush Limbaugh and other leading talkers on the AM dial to a new media landscape with podcasts and social media.\nThe automotive industry and some free-market conservative groups don't like the proposed government mandate in the AM radio bills.\n\"We oppose this legislation,\" John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (which represents carmakers), told lawmakers during committee testimony last year.\nBozzella said AM radio is no longer essential for emergency announcements due to cell phones and other available methods of providing the public with notifications. He said automakers would be open to giving car buyers portable AM radios for their cars on request.\nHe also said the bill tips the marketplace scales in favor of a declining business model.\n\"Customer research suggests that drivers rarely listen to analog AM radio in vehicles anymore. Today, they have lots of options to get news and entertainment while driving,\" Bozzella told the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.\nThe Zero Energy Transportation Association (ZETA) — which represents electric vehicle makers — and the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) also oppose the AM mandate.\nZETA argues public warning systems operate over cellular systems, FM, satellite, digital and internet radio systems and platforms beyond traditional analog AM radio.\nThe cost of cars is already elevated with the average prices of new car in the U.S. approaching $50,000 and Trump administration tariffs creating even more upward price pressures.\nFix and others see favorable odds for passage with more than 300 sponsors of the AM radio bill in Congress this year.\nThat includes GOP conservatives such as Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy of Montana, Rick Scott and Ashley Moody of Florida, and John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming.\nDemocratic and progressive backers include Sens. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\nThe AM push comes as Trump and Republicans in Congress pull federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).\nTrump and his cohorts say NPR and PBS show a liberal bias and should not be supported by public money.\nTrump threatened not to support Republicans who opposed a $1.1 billion clawback of public media funding, and the GOP Congress approved the cuts along with reductions to U.S. foreign aid earlier this month.\nTrump said federal funding for NPR and PBS are wasteful and the outlets are biased against him.\n\"Republicans have tried doing this for 40 years and failed — but no more,\" Trump said. \"This is big.\"\nCPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison said a lack of federal funding for NPR and PBS stations could reduce the number of media outlets, particularly in rural areas.\n\"Without federal funding, many local public radio and television stations will be forced to shut down,\" she said.\nPBS stations received approximately 15% of their funding from CPB and its federal sources. NPR stations, on average, received 13% of their funding from CPB, which was created by Congress in 1967. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Nonviolent protests get results\n\n August 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 398\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n There was a beautiful, peaceful rally in Easton Friday, drawing citizens and faith-based leaders from across the Eastern Shore. Those there gave various personal reasons to attend, mostly to support the family of Easton pastor Daniel Fuentes Espinal, a resident of Easton for over 24 years, who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Monday, July 21. They demanded his release. A veteran activist and board member of the Queen Anne's County Democratic Club, I was honored to attend and felt protest had true value that day.Many of us grew up in the Vietnam-era and got our feet wet protesting an end to that unjustified conflict. We did make a difference that accelerated the end of the war. We knew protesting had value and have taken to the streets since in support of civil rights, climate justice, an end to gun violence and more.\nEven the far-right has made effective use of protest as part of the Tea Party and right-to-life movement. Seasoned activists realize, however, that protests are only effective as part of a goal-driven movement. Professor Michael Lipsky wrote an influential article titled \"Protest as a Political Resource,\" in which he argued that successful movements have clear strategic goals, seek to enlist more powerful individuals in their cause, and connect expressions of discontent to broader political and electoral mobilization.\nDavid Robson wrote for the BBC that nonviolent protests are twice as likely to succeed as armed conflicts. In 1986, millions of Filipinos took to the streets of Manila in peaceful protest and prayer in the People Power Movement. The Marcos' regime folded on the fourth day.\nProtests resulted in the ousters of leaders in Sudan, Algeria and Georgia. At least 3.5 percent of Egyptians protested in the early 2010s, sparking the Arab Spring. The Center for American Progress is among those who conclude that if 3.5 percent of Americans – 12 million people – mobilize to peacefully protest the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration it would virtually be impossible for the government to ignore their demands, including the demand for justice for the Rev. Espinal.\nI am a Unitarian Universalist pacifist who follows the teachings of Gandhi. I cannot sit by and watch injustices without doing something. Nothing gives me hope as much as peaceful protest among a diversity of beautiful human beings. I saw that in Easton last Friday. Now, let's bring Rev. Espinal home.\nMARTI MACKENZIE\nCentreville \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Built in a hurry, it is made up of cages for imprisoning humans and tarps for walls that freely allow mosquitos in and, not to mention, the elements of summer in Florida. People who have been imprisoned there have reported maggots in the food, a lack of clean water, denial of medical care, legal access and other basic human needs. The ACLU declared this \"state-sponsored cruelty\" and filed suit. Thank goodness for the ACLU.\nThe setup is plainly sadistic. And Donald Trump apparently approved when he visited. This denigration is OK with him, but is it OK with you? Is that what we are now? Is this America?\nMy mother served as a WAC in World War II. She often told us how relieved enemy soldiers were to be captured by the U.S. military — as opposed to being captured by Russian soldiers who would just kill them. Americans were big-hearted, kind, compassionate. I was so proud when she spoke of this.\nWhy is this abuse of fellow humans still standing? If we don't protest, are we complicit? We might not be guilty of overt cruelty, but we are guilty of casual cruelty where we carelessly, with little empathy, maybe with a bit of superiority, blame the victim and shrug the thought aside. It's a problem someone else can fix. Do you say to yourself, didn't those illegals put themselves in this mess after all? It's on you. Right?\nJust type \"cruelty Trump\" into your search engine. Maybe the article title from the National Catholic Reporter will come up. It reads, \"Silence in the face of Trump's cruelty is complicity.\" The headlines should be enough to make you weep. I hope so.\nMARION O. ARNOLD\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Bipartisanship in Congress sometimes possible\n\n August 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 798\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CECIL COUNTY – In the nonstop media coverage of discussions, deliberations, debates, and decisions in Congress, there are very rarely updates that include the words bipartisan cooperation.Since Donald Trump was sworn into his second term, Congress has been deeply divided, with countless committee and floor votes decided along party lines.\nThe latest divide in the Senate is not on legislation, but on consideration of President Trump's most recent slate of nominees for executive and judicial positions that require Senate approval.\nRecently Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer insisted consideration of these nominees is contingent on President Trump reversing certain federal spending cuts.\nDespite this ongoing division, two recent proceedings in the Senate prove that bipartisan cooperation, while relatively rare, can occur.\nIt happened with the Senate's Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which has 13 Republican senators and 11 Democratic senators.\nThere are the striking differences between all the committee members but especially so with regard to the chair and ranking minority member.\nThe committee's chair is Rick Scott, a conservative Republican senator from South Carolina who is a staunch supporter of President Trump.\nThe committee's ranking member is Elizabeth Warren, a progressive Democratic senator from Massachusetts who is a frequent critic of President Trump.\nDespite their differences, Scott, Warren and their committee colleagues unanimously approved the Renewing Opportunity in the American Dream Housing Act of 2025 also known as the ROAD Act.\nThe goals of the legislation include expanding and preserving America's housing supply, improving housing affordability and increasing the oversight and efficiency of federal regulators and federal housing programs. It is the first bipartisan federal housing bill in over 10 years (a period that spans President Trump's first term and President Biden's first and only term.)\nFollowing the committee's unanimous vote on the ROAD Act legislation, Sen. Scott said, \"[Ranking member Elizabeth Warren] and I don't agree on almost anything, but here's where a place where all Americans agree … Housing prices are too high, the supply too low and regulations too much. So we went to work a couple of years ago to get this done. Working together as a committee proves to the American people that we can get things done, and it requires, frankly, bipartisanship.\"\nMaryland Democratic U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, a member of the committee, recently reinforced that message by telling a reporter for the Baltimore Sun, \"It's important for people to know that these kinds of efforts are happening ... in a unified Republican government, that there are still ways that we have been able to try to work together.\"\nSen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican member of the committee has said, \"… We have to work together collaboratively to figure out how to make that dream (more housing) more accessible.\"\nThere also has been bipartisan cooperation on other Senate housing legislation.\nMaryland Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen has worked with Republican U.S. Sens. John Boozman of Arkansas and Tim Sheehy of Montana on legislation to provide more information for military veterans on their home loan options.\nGiven the current environment in our society and in Congress, it is highly likely that bipartisan cooperation will be the exception, rather than the rule, in the near future.\nGoing forward, bipartisan cooperation in Congress requires at least three key elements.\nFirst, citizens need to relay their concerns and opinions to their members of Congress early and often.\nSen. Alsobrooks has said it well. \"Housing, I have to tell you, is one of the issues I have heard, and it resonates from every single corner of our state. Work on this particular piece of legislation … is informed by the many, many meetings that I have had with people across the state involving this issue about housing.\"\nSecond, citizens need to remember that despite how strongly held their own opinions may be on any given issue, those opinions may not be widely shared by others.\nWhen decisions are made in any legislative body, including Congress, an unwritten rule is the minority will always have their say, and the majority will always have their way.\nAccordingly, citizen positions should be based what is possible and not all that is wanted.\nAgain, Sen. Alsobrooks said it well. \"There are many, many things [from the Trump administration} that we are pushing back against. But we've also understood that, in order to get things done for our constituents, we're going to have to find partnerships on the places where we can agree on things to get things done.\"\nThird, citizens, members of Congress and presidents need to keep in mind that every two-years congressional elections are held, and the results determine which political party will have congressional majorities for the following two years.\nAfter those majorities are determined every member of Congress should be held accountable on their commitment to and results on advancing partisan cooperation to get things done that will help bridge the current deep divides in our society. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

On several levels, from economic to public safety to morally and ethically, the Trump Administration's aggressive deportation campaign does not serve us well.Over 8 million unauthorized US workers contributed $73 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2022 through the use of ITIN numbers, a voluntary process since they are not eligible for Social Security numbers. Additionally, these workers paid $33.9 billion in payroll deductions to Medicare, Social Security and unemployment insurance, programs for which they are not eligible to receive benefits. Tracking down unauthorized taxpaying residents for deportation discourages the voluntary payment of taxes and drives otherwise lawful persons underground.\nResidents fearful of deportation are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement if they become witnesses to or victims of crime. This allows criminals in our community to flourish as a segment of the population becomes vulnerable to extortion, abuse and human trafficking.\nFrom a moral and ethical standpoint, the U.S. has allowed over 10 million unauthorized immigrants to remain in this country for decades – working, raising families and otherwise contributing to the strength of our communities. For most of these residents there is no path to legal residency and citizenship.\nImmigration enforcement has shifted wildly from administration to administration because we lack consistent, rational and comprehensive immigration reform. Recent attempts at bipartisan immigration policy have been scuttled by extremists who see political benefit in the current dysfunctional system. To suddenly snatch long-standing residents off the street as they go about their daily lives, as has happened in this community and many others, is cruel and places us as U.S. citizens in moral jeopardy.\nEach of us has an obligation to speak out to our elected leaders and let them know how we feel about this policy.\nMARY M.

Chris Van Hollen with thunderous applause Thursday evening as the Maryland Democrat delivered a blistering critique of the Trump administration's early actions.The group gave Van Hollen a standing ovation as he entered for the Aug. 14 town hall, though a small contingent of apparent Trump supporters remained mostly silent throughout the evening. One disgruntled person appeared to walk out midway through the senator's remarks.\nThe town hall was supposed to include Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, but Van Hollen said she had called him that morning, saying she tested positive for COVID-19 and would not be able to attend.\nVan Hollen wasted little time launching into what he called the \"big ugly betrayal of a bill\" — referring to recent Republican legislation that he said reduces Medicaid and food nutrition programs \"as a way to continue tax cuts for the wealthy.\"\n\"The people he said he was campaigning for are the ones going to be hardest hit,\" Van Hollen told the crowd, drawing vigorous nods from attendees.\nThe senator, who supports targeted tariffs on strategic industries, slammed Trump's across-the-board approach as \"just a way of taxing the nation.\" He warned that punishing clean energy investments creates an overall energy shortage that drives up electricity costs.\n\"We have a shortage of energy,\" Van Hollen said. \"By literally punishing clean energy, not only are you punishing the source of energy that's more environmentally friendly, you're also just reducing the overall supply of energy.\"\nICE FACILITY\nVan Hollen detailed his recent visit to Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Baltimore field office, where he said officials are operating what amounts to an unlawful detention center while claiming it's merely a holding facility.\nThe senator said ICE officials changed their standard from a 12-hour maximum stay to an average of 72 hours with some detainees held up to eight days, according to public reports.\n\"By any normal interpretation of the word detention, this is a detention center, despite what they're saying,\" Van Hollen said. \"If they weren't using it as a detention center, they wouldn't have had to change the 12-hour standard that had been put in place.\"\nVan Hollen said ICE officials refused to let him interview detainees, citing Maryland state law — a claim he called \"baseless\" since the law contains no such restrictions on congressional oversight.\n\"We left with more questions than answers,\" he said, adding that his office has demanded ICE provide evidence for their tracking systems and detention procedures.\nEASTERN SHORE PRIORITIES\nWhen asked about regional concerns, Van Hollen outlined three Eastern Shore priorities: quality education, affordable health care and job opportunities.\nHe expressed particular alarm about potential shutdowns of the Department of Education, calling the Chesapeake Bay \"a great national treasure\" and \"an opportunity to work in a bipartisan way.\"\n\"The Bay is lifeblood for watermen, tourism, seafood industry,\" he said, noting his work on H-2B visas for migrant workers in the seafood industry.\nVan Hollen touted efforts to combat invasive blue catfish: \"We have to eat our way out of this problem.\"\nPOLITICAL WARNINGSThe senator delivered some of his sharpest rhetoric when discussing redistricting, accusing Texas of preparing to \"steal the 2026 election\" through congressional map changes ordered by Trump.\n\"I do not believe in unilateral disarmament,\" Van Hollen declared when asked if Maryland should follow suit.\nHe demanded transparency on the Jeffrey Epstein case files, saying: \"Enough of this, release the damn files\" while protecting victims, not perpetrators.\nVan Hollen warned the crowd about threats to Social Security and environmental protections, calling the current moment a test of American democracy.\n\"The system is designed to take a lot of strain,\" he said, \"but the kind of strain that's being put on it right now, I'm afraid if we don't really push back hard right now, it could break.\"\nDespite the partisan edge to much of his presentation, Van Hollen closed on a unifying note, telling the audience: \"At the end of the day, it is all of you that will determine our future.\"\nThe town hall marked Van Hollen's latest stop in a series of public forums across Maryland as Democrats gear up for the 2026 midterm elections. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

His comments included:\"The worst has been numerous messages on social media and other media platforms — e.g., a newspaper editorial cartoon — that were vile, hateful and some of which were vulgar.\"\n\"Many of them chose to blame Trump supporters or policy decisions of the Trump administration for this tragedy.\"\n\"Far too many did not include expressions of sadness or sympathy for the deaths of innocent children and adults or compassion for the lifelong impact on all the flooding survivors.\"\n\"The only thing they have in common is they are devoid of any sense of decency and civility.\"\nDevoid of any sense of decency and civility. Sounds like the Trump administration to a T.\nMr. Reel and the Republican Party have forfeited all rights to criticize, for any reason, anyone for their perceived lack of empathy. Their leader, Donald Trump, during his first term, under the leadership of Stephen Miller, raised family separation at the border to an art form.\nDonald Trump famously mocked a reporter with disabilities while on the campaign trail in November 2015. He castigated John McCain on the campaign trail, saying \"He's not a war hero. He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured.\"\nThe recently passed budget bill (nothing beautiful about it) is going to force millions of people off Medicaid and SNAP and is already forcing some rural hospitals to close.\nThe recently enacted taxes (that's what tariffs are) are going to cause many small businesses to close and raise the cost of living for everyone else (except the uber rich). There's the failure to release the full Epstein files which just further downplays the plight of the many victims of this pedophile.\nSo please, Mr. Reel, spare us the lectures about empathy.\nSTEVE SHIMKO\nSt. Michaels \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'1984' was not fiction ... it was a warning\n\n August 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JARED O. BELL | Section: Columns \n \n 896\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n If I'm completely honest, I can't recall all the twists and turns of \"1984.\"I probably read it in high school or maybe as an undergrad, somewhere alongside \"Animal Farm.\" They're the kind of books teachers press into young hands to spark critical thinking, to push us to look beyond the surface, question the official story, and spot the sleight of hand in politics and power. What has stayed with me isn't the fine detail of the plot, but the feeling it left behind: that the words on the page were not just fiction, but a warning, one I wasn't sure I needed at the time, but which feels uncomfortably relevant now.\nIn \"1984,\" George Orwell particularly warned us about the dangers of language twisted into a tool of control. His fictional Newspeak and doublethink have since morphed into what we now call doublespeak, the art of making lies sound truthful, brutality seem humane and repression appear just and fair. In the U.S. and around the world, the language of democracy and human rights is often wielded not as a shield for the vulnerable, but as a weapon to serve political agendas and target those deemed expendable.\nWhile this is hardly new, as history is littered with leaders who cloaked repression in the language of freedom, today the phenomenon is compounded by the reach and velocity of social media, 24-hour news cycles and algorithm-driven outrage. These tools don't just spread doublespeak; they normalize it, rewarding those who weaponize democratic ideals with likes, shares and airtime until the distortion becomes the dominant narrative.\nWords like democracy, freedom, justice, fairness, human rights, along with lofty invocations of \"protecting the rule of law,\" have been co-opted by those who embody anything but. What's more unsettling is how banal this has become, so regularized that for those of us who still hold to the true principles of democracy, the world now feels upside down.\nOne example that has stayed with me comes from the Trump administration's deportations without due process. On social media, I repeatedly saw the refrain: \"This is what I voted for, a president promising to remove those who entered the U.S. 'illegally,'\" all under the guise of protecting the rule of law.\nYet the reality was far murkier. Take the case of Kilmar Abrego García, who in 2019 was granted protection from removal by an immigration judge due to credible threats in El Salvador. That order was ignored, and he was deported anyway — even as another federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to halt such actions. In other words, the rhetoric of law and justice was invoked while the actual rule of law was being actively undermined.\nAnother example from the U.S. is the notion that somehow suppressing the rights of trans women promotes the rights and liberties of women, a claim wrapped in the language of \"protection\" and \"fairness.\" Meanwhile many of the same states advancing these measures have simultaneously moved to strip away women's reproductive freedoms, curtailing their ability to make decisions about their own bodies and health care.\nOr, on a more global scale, consider the mass killing of civilians in Gaza, permitted, even rationalized, by much of the international community, especially in the West, under the guise of delivering \"justice\" and \"accountability\" for the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, which targeted and kidnapped innocent civilians. Yet Israel has been allowed, and actively supported, in carrying out indiscriminate bombings that have killed thousands, actions that are anything but justice or accountability.\nThe United States and several European countries have blocked or watered down UN Security Council resolutions calling for an immediate ceasefire, while continuing to supply Israel with military aid despite mounting civilian casualties. Meanwhile, the United States has sanctioned ICC judges and United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.\nUsing the language of democracy and human rights is no different from leaders invoking \"protection\" during emergencies, not to safeguard the public, but to consolidate power and erode democratic norms. After 9/11, the United States expanded surveillance and curtailed civil liberties. During COVID-19, Hungary used emergency powers to rule by decree. In Egypt, anti-terror laws have been turned against journalists and political opponents.\nIn each case, the rhetoric of safety masked a tightening grip on power. Yet when democracy and human rights are twisted into this same kind of doublespeak, we undermine values that are already fragile, and, to be blunt, growing more fleeting by the day. The Economist Intelligence Unit reported a plunge in the global average democracy rating to 5.17 in 2024, the lowest since tracking began in 2006, with roughly 39% of the world's population now living under authoritarian regimes.\nThese figures are not simply a barometer of democratic vitality; they are a warning. The doublespeak that corrodes democracy on paper is the same force shaping real-world crises. To challenge these forces and those who hijack the language of democracy and human rights for their own ends, the true essence of these values must be continually echoed.\nEvery NGO, movement, article, discussion, meme, TikTok video or other act that counters these narratives helps protect the genuine form and spirit of democracy and human rights. Without such efforts, the values we hold dear will keep being twisted into tools of their own destruction, as we sink further into a present-day dystopia where the language of freedom is mistranslated into the language of repression. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Are we spending too much to arrest immigrants?\n\n August 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 462\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The tax and spending bill passed by Congress and signed by President Trump on July 4 allocated $45 billion over four years to snatch undocumented migrants and some legal immigrants off the street or from their jobs and to lock them up. This is far more money than any previous president spent on removing undocumented migrants. Those doing the snatching are the masked, unidentified ICE agents, or Trump's new \"secret police\" who will balloon in numbers.This \"secret police\" force, reporting to the Department of Homeland Security and, therefore, to the president is bigger than most countries' military force. It is reminiscent of the Brown Shirts under Benito Mussolini in Italy before and during World War II. A police force reporting to the president of a country is out of character for any democracy in modern times.\nThe new detention centers for the unfortunates snatched up, who seldom have committed a crime, are being deliberately built in the worst locations. We all saw photos of President Trump visiting \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" a tent camp (so far) built on an unused airfield in the middle of the Everglades in Florida. This part of the Everglades is populated by big snakes and alligators.\nAccording to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem, the camp will be paid for by FEMA and will cost $450 million per year to maintain. It can so far accommodate 5,000 people, but it can only withstand a Level 2 hurricane. More severe hurricanes occur in this part of Florida occasionally. The disregard for human life and the dehumanization of migrants who only came to the U.S. to build a better life for themselves and their families is extraordinary.\nMigrant advocates have raised concerns about the living conditions in tents, but President Trump likes these unsafe structures with poor ventilation, as tents can be erected quickly. (Even the Nazis provided wooden housing in their concentration camps.) Apparently, Homeland Security needs 100,000 beds quickly. They are looking into using old prisons such as Alcatraz in San Francisco. At least 10 migrants died while in ICE custody in the first half of 2025.\nThe Big Beautiful Bill also includes $46.5 billion for building the famous wall toward Mexico and $6 billion for border technology and surveillance, along with other border security and immigration measures.\nWhy are we agreeing to spend such a large amount of money on a nearly non-existing problem? Trump has closed the border, so few new migrants are coming into the U.S. According to most experts undocumented and documented immigrants are committing many fewer crimes than U.S. citizens. We also need these people to do jobs that most citizens do not want to do. Here in Maryland the jobs tend to be picking crab meat and harvesting farm products that would otherwise rot on the vine. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But to call NPR \"elitist\" betrays the network's character.\nRecall the weekly series over four decades ago, \"IBM's Your Heart of Music: The Program About Life and the Classics that Help You to Live It,\" of which I was writer, producer and host. It was the program in which you heard common topics from life — the death of a parent, the birth of a child, being in love, trouble with your boss — and what the great composers thought of such themes in their works.\nListeners wrote and called, some in tears, grateful for a broadcast that spoke to their common lives. Elitist? No way. And personally, the show taught me so much about becoming a priest.\nTruth is, listeners stumbled onto Your Heart of Music because they were already tuned in for our trustworthiness of NPR's news and human interest reporting. Listener research has long proven NPR has the broadest appeal of all things on the air.\nBut let us pray for the lonely Mr. Gingrich and his old citations, who has lost so many friends.\nTHE RT. REV.

    "content": "Easton pastor reunited with family after ICE detention\n\n August 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 881\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — When Daniel Fuentes Espinal walked out of an ICE detention center in Louisiana on Thursday, his oldest daughter shed tears before hugging him.In an interview with The Star Democrat Sunday afternoon, Clarissa Fuentes Diaz recounted the emotional reunion with her father. It came nearly a month after he was arrested by ICE agents in Easton while heading to work the morning of July 21.\nDiaz and her husband flew to New Orleans on Thursday morning after a judge ordered bond and Diaz posted it the day prior. They made a four-hour drive to the ICE detention center southwest of Winnfield, about 160 miles northwest of Baton Rouge.\nAround 4:30 p.m., Espinal and his oldest daughter embraced.\n\"When (the guard) told me he is getting released, I started obviously tearing up,\" she said. \"And then when we finally went in there, I was already crying. This is actually happening, after a month. I'm actually gonna hug my dad again.\"\nThey stopped at a restaurant that night for dinner, then flew back to Maryland, where Espinal was reunited with the rest of his family Friday night.\nDiaz said her sister and brother, Daniela and Daniel, are holding up well. Daniela will soon move into her dorm at the University of Maryland. Her \"worst fear\" was her dad not being there, Diaz said, a worry that's now gone.\nEspinal's case has garnered national attention in the weeks since his arrest, as have its impacts on the Easton community. Services at the Iglesia del Nazareno Jesús Te Ama, where Espinal has been pastor since 2015, were temporarily halted. Maryland representatives in Congress, Town Council members and protesters rallying weekly since his arrest called for Espinal's release.\nBorn in Honduras, the 54-year-old pastor has been in the country since 2001 and has no criminal record, his family has said. Following his arrest, ICE said he was arrested for overstaying his six-month visa.\n\"Fuentes entered the United States on a 6-month visa and never left in 24 years,\" ICE wrote in a statement last month. \"It is a federal crime to overstay the authorized period of time granted under a visitors visa.\"\nDiaz acknowledged that the family has tried to fix Espinal's status. She said it's been hard to find a \"pathway,\" but this year they had plans to apply for naturalization.\n\"Whoever says that it's easy, it's not,\" Diaz said. \"It really isn't.\"\nCONTINUING TO PREACH\nReturning from Louisiana, Espinal told his family it wasn't all doom-and-gloom. Conditions were \"not ideal,\" Diaz said, but her father had a bed, a private bathroom and received some medications.\nThe experience led to a medical discovery. His family knew Espinal was pre-diabetic; a nurse at the Winn Correctional Center officially diagnosed him with diabetes.\n\"He's like, 'I can't say anything bad about Louisiana,'\" Diaz said of what Espinal has conveyed. \"'They treated me with respect. They gave me what I needed.'\"\nEspinal told his family about his experience with the detention center's church.\nThe center's chaplain saw Espinal on the news and invited the pastor to preach and lead Bible studies, Diaz said. Sparsely attended services and studies grew enormously.\n\"He said that from 13 people that he preached on that first day, the last day that he was there, 85 people started attending,\" Diaz said. \"And he said not just Christians ... Muslims, Hindus, people from Ethiopia, just different ethnicities wanting to hear the gospel.\"\nThe chaplain told Espinal \"he's never seen anything like this\" in around 10 years at the facility, Diaz said.\n\"Being the light in someone else's darkness during your process is amazing to see, not because he's my dad and not because I'm his daughter,\" Diaz said on Sunday. \"But when God uses you as a vessel, that's when people come at you the most.\"\nWHAT'S NEXT\nEspinal appeared at his church on Sunday, though he's not back to leading services. Diaz said this week will include a medical visit given his new diabetes diagnosis.\nEspinal's case remains in Louisiana, although Diaz said the family and their attorney are asking to have it moved to Maryland. She said they are waiting to be notified of the next court hearing.\nMaryland politicians in Congress have taken mixed stances on Espinal's case, largely along party lines.\nIn a statement Monday, Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) said he views Espinal's bond release as \"appropriate\" pending a court appearance. The congressman, though, said federal law on overstaying a visa \"is clear.\"\n\"Under that law Mr. Espinal is subject to deportation,\" Harris' statement read. \"As the process moves forward, I will continue to be in contact with (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi) Noem's office about whether an exception to deportation is possible in this case in the event the immigration judge rules against Mr. Espinal.\"\nOn Saturday, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) called Espinal's return home \"an important victory\" and said \"there are many more like him\" in a post on X.\nDiaz says \"words are not enough\" to thank the community, politicians and family friends for their support over the last weeks. Espinal and his oldest daughter released a video statement on Sunday.\n\"I'm very happy to be home with my family and my community,\" Espinal said.\n\"I'm just happy, my heart is full. My dad is home,\" Diaz said. \"Just praying for whatever outcome, or whatever happens. Just keeping our faith. The faith that we had at the beginning won't break.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He was the fifth commissioner or acting commissioner in a period of seven months.\nYou have to wonder why the president would have chosen Billy Long to serve as the IRS commissioner in the first place.\nHe was a congressman from Missouri from 2011 to 2023. His background was as an auctioneer and real estate agent. According to news sources, the only tax credentials he had ever received were a designation as a \"certified tax and business adviser,\" a title given after taking a short class from a business in Florida.\nAfter getting his certificate, he was involved with companies that assisted businesses and nonprofits in applying for the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit available in 2020 and 2021 for employers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFrom my own experience as both a tax preparer and taxpayer, I have found the civil servants who work for the IRS are some of the smartest and most competent in the federal government. It makes me wonder how these tax professionals kept up their morale with Mr. Long as the commissioner.\nAdd to that the effects of the DOGE project on IRS employees. Since January of this year, thousands have left the agency.\nMore than 266 million tax returns were filed with the IRS in fiscal year 2024, collecting more than $5 trillion in tax revenue and $98 billion in enforcement revenue.\nGiven the enormous, looming debt we are facing, tax revenue is crucial to keep the government functioning and to pay the interest due on this debt.\nI feel fortunate to live in a country where, at least until now, I can file my tax returns and feel confident that they will be processed by an agency that abides by the rules, keeps my records confidential, sends me refunds or credits my payments in an orderly and efficient manner.\nStability and consistency in tax administration are also necessary for a thriving American business community.\nThe IRS deserves good leadership in order to maintain public trust. A healthy U.S. financial system depends on a well-functioning Internal Revenue Service.\nELAINE TAMA\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

How about the gangs of armed, masked gunmen grabbing people off the street and disappearing them into a vast prison system or sending them to a foreign maximum security terrorist gulag?\nHow about sending federalized troops into democratic cities under the pretext that an emergency exists, when in fact violent crime is at a 30-year low in DC?\nHow about appointing incompetents to lead the Defense Department, the Department of Justice, our national intelligence agencies, the FBI? How about Elon Musk, the world's richest man, taking a chainsaw to federal jobs and workers families, dancing with glee? How about the attacks on science, education, universities, the free press, the judiciary and the rule of law?\nAmericans have faced many crises in our 250-year history. Whether political parties hold open primaries is not one of them. It can certainly wait to be addressed in due course, if ever. Instead, let's focus and face the immediate, unrelenting assault on traditional American values and institutions.\nIf we fail, future generations will look back at hypothetical questions about open primaries and merely shake their heads, wondering how we could have been so oblivious to the real threats to the survival of a democratic society.\nMICHAEL PULLEN\nRoyal Oak \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Taking the podium at Canton Waterfront Park, he said his campaign would focus on public safety and education. His formal announcement came just three months after he informally declared his candidacy as a Democratic opponent to incumbent Gov. Wes Moore.\nHale, who formally announced his candidacy for the 2026 Maryland governor's race last week, has a complex resume.\nAccording to a 2015 article in the Wall Street Journal, Hale disclosed that he worked covertly for the Central Intelligence Agency for nearly a decade during the 1990s and early 2000s. He said he allowed the CIA to create a fictitious company under his corporate umbrella to be used as cover for field operatives, and claimed he spoke with a CIA handler between 30 and 50 times a year. Hale reported traveling to Saudi Arabia, Poland, Denmark and Norway, among other places, providing the agency with economic reports upon his return. He also said he was involved in a canceled operation in Georgia in 1998 concerning the purchase of ships for intelligence purposes and played a role in the CIA's early search for Osama bin Laden by facilitating covert agent deployments across Central Asia. Hale said his role with the CIA ended after the Sept. 11 attacks.\nIn addition to his intelligence work, Hale founded First Mariner Bancorp before stepping down from an operational role in 2011. He also owns property in Easton.\nHale's roots run deep in southeastern Baltimore City and Baltimore County. He was born and raised in Dundalk and, according to previous Eagle coverage, chipped in money to help restore the wrought iron gates at Dundalk's Battle Monument Park in 2014 after a resident stole the previous structure to sell for scrap.\nThe businessman is also responsible for the development of Canton Tower, the 17-story waterfront structure that kicked off a wave of retail and housing growth in the area during the 2000s and 2010s.\nWhile he has had a hand in Baltimore's development, Hale's pursuits extend beyond the city. He currently owns the Baltimore Blast soccer team.\nHis Republican candidacy, however, is already proving contentious.\nIn a press release published shortly after Hale's announcement, Maryland Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey voiced concerns about the businessman's sudden platform switch.\n\"Just because he may no longer feel comfortable associating with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party doesn't mean he now embraces the Republican Party's long-standing principles of limited government, fiscal responsibility, individual liberty, and strong public safety,\" Hershey said.\n\"We've built a Republican movement in Maryland that stands for more than just opposition to the far left — it stands for authentic leadership and a clear governing philosophy,\" he continued. \"Our voters expect more than opportunism — they expect commitment.\"\nOthers, like county council candidate Tim Fazenbaker, have aligned themselves with Hale. In a recent interview, Fazenbaker said that he and Hale, both natives of the greater Dundalk area, are planning a joint tour of Dundalk in the coming months.\nMitchell is an attorney and former chairman of the Board of Appeals at Maryland Department of Labor.\nEditor Hannah Combs contributed to this article. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "The GOP has turned core principles on their head",

    "content": "The GOP has turned core principles on their head\n\n August 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KARY LOVE | Section: Columns \n \n 831\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As a civil rights lawyer, I wanted to dedicate my life to preserving and defending the Bill of Rights. I saw that as the highest duty imposed by my oath to \"preserve and defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies foreign and domestic.\"I took all kinds of civil rights cases — one of the first I worked with the ACLU of Illinois to defend the American Nazi Party right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a place with a large number of people who survived Hitler's death camps. Unlike Nazis, the ACLU and I agreed even those whose politics we detest, the Nazis, have rights to freedom of speech. Ironically in that case I was the sole ACLU lawyer who was not Jewish. Amusing, no?\nI worked on many other civil rights cases. I represented U.S. Army whistleblowers concerned about waste and fraud in military contracts, black carpenters denied jobs based on race, the rights of a disabled woman to say grace over her meals in a state run group home, librarians threatened with being fired due to school library book selection. Because the Bill of Rights applies to people, not only citizens, my rule was if a core Bill of Rights right is involved, I am willing to fight for that right even if I personally disagree with the views of my client.\nWhen I first moved to the most Republican county in Michigan, where the people had overwhelmingly voted for Republicans since Abe Lincoln, I realized that if I wanted to get things done outside of court, the GOP was the way to go. I ended up being \"elected\" a GOP \"precinct committeeman\" for a number of years. You may have never heard of this \"elected\" job. Precinct committeemen don't get paid, work for free, and mostly do things out of sight and out of the news.\nBut in time I was able to get two amendments to the Michigan Constitution passed, fully supported by the GOP: one was term limits. The GOP supported ending \"professional politicians,\" which had not worked too well, because they put more and more government regulation on the backs of the people, and replacing them with citizen lawmakers, on the view that \"ordinary citizens,\" who worked for their neighbors were preferable to pro politicians who worked for re-election and those who had the money to pay for it.\nThe second was property tax relief. We passed \"Prop A\" trying to give the people protection against constantly increasing taxes on their homes. Again the GOP supported lower taxes, tax freedom and constraints on government growth and cost.\nToday the GOP has turned its principles on their head. They want a perpetual president, not term limits. A constant Congress made in their image. Not term limits. They want more taxes for government funding of ICE, TSA, CBP and DHS among others, to intrude more and more into the lives of neighborhoods.\nRather than cutting spending, the GOP is blowing past all rational restraints. Rather than supporting the right of the people to \"get the government off their backs,\" the GOP is putting more and more government agents on the backs of the people.\nInstead of promoting self-government, by letting states and local governments run according to the will of the local people, the GOP is acting like Moscow and dictating central planning from D.C. in total disregard of state's rights, and the Ninth and 10th Amendments to the Bill of Rights. Instead of freedom of the people to make their own decisions and run their own neighborhood and businesses, the GOP is imposing more central planning from the nation's capital, including increasing the federal police, army, ICE and other actions against local people often against their will.\nEven worse, they are now contrary to the GOP \"principle\" enunciated by President Ronald Reagan at a press conference on Aug. 12th, 1986. President Reagan said, \"The nine most terrifying words in the English language are 'I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.'\"\nReagan is rolling in his grave at the news the GOP is sending masked, unidentified federal cops, national guard and even Marines into neighborhoods often without the consent of the governed. The fact that the \"reason\" for sending in the U.S. Marshals, Secret Service, FBI and others is based on \"fake news\" (i.e., false claims about crime) is hugely concerning.\nBut when you enable those federal agents to go masked and unidentified, you are deploying the undeniably \"secret police\" on the streets of America. Already reports emerge of people \"kidnapped\" off the streets by masked men unidentifiable as police. One anticipates true criminals will soon realize that, if they dress in \"camo\" and wear a mask and shout, \"We are federal agents,\" their crimes will be enabled, not deterred.\nWhen you cannot tell the cops from the robbers, you are in deep water without a life vest, wearing cement overshoes. I may be wrong, but to me not being able to tell the cops from the robbers is the antithesis of America. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

During the era of Franco, from the end of the civil war in 1939 until his death in 1975, police force was ever present in the capital, Madrid, and throughout the country in small towns and larger cities, urban and rural.For older individuals in this population, the bloody civil war of 1936-1939 was still raw with memories of atrocities. When Franco ceded power to Juan Carlos in 1974 and officially transferred power upon his death in 1975, Spain experienced an opening of freedoms — freedom of the press, religious freedom, freedom to gather, freedom to speak and criticize and express oneself openly without fear of government reprisal.\nDuring the transition into a democratic state, my elderly neighbor and landlady, who had lived through the turmoil of the civil war and was at that time witness to the transition into a democratic state, bemoaned the loss of strict law and order that had been imposed during Franco's regime. To her, the freedoms gained through a transition to a free democratic society had a cost. I think her question, \"Is this democracy worth it?\" is a repeated one that is worth considering today.\nSUSAN MacKINNON\nOxford \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Grassroot and AstroTurf protests in America\n\n August 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 738\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Bill of Rights in the United States Constitution prohibits Congress from restricting the right of the people to assemble peacefully and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.This provision is a fundamental reason that, while America is not perfect, it is one of the few places in the world that explicitly provides for and embraces the concept that everyone has a right to challenge their government.\nProtests in America have been the norm since we were founded and secured independence from Britain, which was driven in large part to a failure by Britain's leadership to provide a path for the colonists to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\nNotable and successful protests that made a difference in American society are beyond counting.\nThey include protests for women's voting rights, for civil rights for Black Americans and against military actions like the war in Southeast Asia.\nHistorically, these protests are known as \"grassroots\" protests.\nA hallmark of grassroots protests are groups of volunteers who are energized and mobilized by a shared commitment to addressing a grievance of deep concern to them. Their goals are to educate the public and generate public support for ideas on how to address that grievance.\nA perfect example of grassroots protests done right were recent protests organized and executed by a group of Mid-Shore volunteers. Their peaceful protests helped secure the release of Pastor Daniel Fuentes Espinal from detention by U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nUnfortunately, America is experiencing fewer grassroots protests and more AstroTurf protests.\nAstroTurf protests do not include volunteers who are energized and mobilized by a shared deep commitment to and sincere concern about a grievance. They include paid protestors who are energized and mobilized solely by a shared commitment to receiving payment for services rendered.\nTheir goals are to help create an often-false perception that there is significant public support for addressing the grievance for which they are being paid, either directly or indirectly, and often by limited transparency on exactly where funds are coming from to pay them.\nTheir carefully orchestrated protests are especially appealing to some in the national media, who feature reports on AstroTurf protests to attract readers and viewers and also promote a perception there is widespread public support for addressing AstroTurf protesters grievances and their proposed solution on how to do so.\nA perfect example of AstroTurf protesting is now occurring in Washington, D.C., which not coincidentally, is the center of the political universe for almost all the national media.\nThese AstroTurf protests are focused on the Trump administration's decision to deploy military troops to help address crime in Washington, D.C.\nThis decision is very contentious in large part because of conflicting and unresolved questions on the accuracy of past and current reports on the actual levels of serious crimes there.\nIn any event, these protests confirm the growing use and problems of AstroTurf protests.\nAdam Swart is president of Crowds on Demand, a nationwide company that provides clients with hired actors to serve as paid protesters.\nHis business in Washington, D.C., is booming.\nIn a recent interview, Swart said, \"Right now, D.C. inquiries are up roughly 400% compared to the same period in 2024.\"\nSwart also said his company always sees a spike in requests during what he calls \"high-stakes political moments.\"\nMost revealing is Swart's candid acknowledgement that the \"vast majority\" of people at political or advocacy events in D.C. are in some way paid.\nThis affirms their actions are based more on what they are paid to say and do, rather than on an understanding of and commitment to addressing the protest's stated grievance.\nSuch motivations were certainly not what was envisioned by America's national leaders when they adopted the Bill of Rights as amendments to the U.S. Constitution in 1791.\nThese amendments have served America well. Until now.\nComparable to the years before and during the War Between the States, our society is deeply divided, politically and socially.\nAstroTurf protests do nothing to help heal our divisions. In fact, they make them worse.\nThat said, our constitution allows for carefully scripted AstroTurf paid protest performances, even if the protesters are making a mockery of true grassroots protest principles.\nAccordingly, the public, elected officials, and the national media must continuously exercise due diligence in evaluating the motivation and commitment of paid AstroTurf protesters performing in nothing more than political stunts.\nAt the same time, we must listen to and respect the grievances of legitimate volunteer grassroots protesters, even if we may disagree fully or partially with those grievances or how to address them. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'1984' was not fiction ... it was a warning\n\n September 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JARED O. BELL | Section: Columns \n \n 896\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n If I'm completely honest, I can't recall all the twists and turns of \"1984.\"I probably read it in high school or maybe as an undergrad, somewhere alongside \"Animal Farm.\" They're the kind of books teachers press into young hands to spark critical thinking, to push us to look beyond the surface, question the official story, and spot the sleight of hand in politics and power. What has stayed with me isn't the fine detail of the plot, but the feeling it left behind: that the words on the page were not just fiction, but a warning, one I wasn't sure I needed at the time, but which feels uncomfortably relevant now.\nIn \"1984,\" George Orwell particularly warned us about the dangers of language twisted into a tool of control. His fictional Newspeak and doublethink have since morphed into what we now call doublespeak, the art of making lies sound truthful, brutality seem humane and repression appear just and fair. In the U.S. and around the world, the language of democracy and human rights is often wielded not as a shield for the vulnerable, but as a weapon to serve political agendas and target those deemed expendable.\nWhile this is hardly new, as history is littered with leaders who cloaked repression in the language of freedom, today the phenomenon is compounded by the reach and velocity of social media, 24-hour news cycles and algorithm-driven outrage. These tools don't just spread doublespeak; they normalize it, rewarding those who weaponize democratic ideals with likes, shares and airtime until the distortion becomes the dominant narrative.\nWords like democracy, freedom, justice, fairness, human rights, along with lofty invocations of \"protecting the rule of law,\" have been co-opted by those who embody anything but. What's more unsettling is how banal this has become, so regularized that for those of us who still hold to the true principles of democracy, the world now feels upside down.\nOne example that has stayed with me comes from the Trump administration's deportations without due process. On social media, I repeatedly saw the refrain: \"This is what I voted for, a president promising to remove those who entered the U.S. 'illegally,'\" all under the guise of protecting the rule of law.\nYet the reality was far murkier. Take the case of Kilmar Abrego García, who in 2019 was granted protection from removal by an immigration judge due to credible threats in El Salvador. That order was ignored, and he was deported anyway — even as another federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to halt such actions. In other words, the rhetoric of law and justice was invoked while the actual rule of law was being actively undermined.\nAnother example from the U.S. is the notion that somehow suppressing the rights of trans women promotes the rights and liberties of women, a claim wrapped in the language of \"protection\" and \"fairness.\" Meanwhile many of the same states advancing these measures have simultaneously moved to strip away women's reproductive freedoms, curtailing their ability to make decisions about their own bodies and health care.\nOr, on a more global scale, consider the mass killing of civilians in Gaza, permitted, even rationalized, by much of the international community, especially in the West, under the guise of delivering \"justice\" and \"accountability\" for the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, which targeted and kidnapped innocent civilians. Yet Israel has been allowed, and actively supported, in carrying out indiscriminate bombings that have killed thousands, actions that are anything but justice or accountability.\nThe United States and several European countries have blocked or watered down UN Security Council resolutions calling for an immediate ceasefire, while continuing to supply Israel with military aid despite mounting civilian casualties. Meanwhile, the United States has sanctioned ICC judges and United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.\nUsing the language of democracy and human rights is no different from leaders invoking \"protection\" during emergencies, not to safeguard the public, but to consolidate power and erode democratic norms. After 9/11, the United States expanded surveillance and curtailed civil liberties. During COVID-19, Hungary used emergency powers to rule by decree. In Egypt, anti-terror laws have been turned against journalists and political opponents.\nIn each case, the rhetoric of safety masked a tightening grip on power. Yet when democracy and human rights are twisted into this same kind of doublespeak, we undermine values that are already fragile, and, to be blunt, growing more fleeting by the day. The Economist Intelligence Unit reported a plunge in the global average democracy rating to 5.17 in 2024, the lowest since tracking began in 2006, with roughly 39% of the world's population now living under authoritarian regimes.\nThese figures are not simply a barometer of democratic vitality; they are a warning. The doublespeak that corrodes democracy on paper is the same force shaping real-world crises. To challenge these forces and those who hijack the language of democracy and human rights for their own ends, the true essence of these values must be continually echoed.\nEvery NGO, movement, article, discussion, meme, TikTok video or other act that counters these narratives helps protect the genuine form and spirit of democracy and human rights. Without such efforts, the values we hold dear will keep being twisted into tools of their own destruction, as we sink further into a present-day dystopia where the language of freedom is mistranslated into the language of repression. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Sunday's leg of it ended in Towson, with marchers carrying copies of the sections of the Constitution copied by more than 50 kids across the nation.\n\"We found as many children as we could across the country to help create the Constitution,\" Bohara said. \"It's their lives, it's their country we're fighting for.\"\nJaxy Lagrome, a resident of Perry Hall, said she decided to participate in the march because of her children, including her 10-year-old daughter Dana, who helped copy part of the constitution.\n\"I want the world to be a better place for them,\" Lagrome said. I want them to be able to be themselves, to be surrounded by good people, like the people here, and to be free to pursue what they want to do.\"\nLagrome was towing a large \"trojan horse\" behind her vehicle as she marches. As they make their trip, people are covering the horse with notes about what they care about, Lagrome said.\nIt's been a conversation starter, she said.\n\"I have a lot of Republicans who come up to me and ask questions, and when I tell them that this is really just to be funny, light hearted, keep everything positive and to bring community together, they're open to it too,\" Lagrome said. \"It's hard to be mad at the purple horse.\"\nA 16-year-old Montgomery County resident named Graham Milner joined for the weekend, influenced by issues like gun law policies and deportations. He said he thinks it's important to show that children care about issues that affect them.\n\"It is our future that is being affected … by anything that's being passed by Congress, and so it's really important that we are being represented,\" Milner said. \"The best way to do that is to come out and do it yourself.\"\nSome participants have been with the march since Philadelphia.\nJanet Carmosky from Albany, New York, and Jimmy Sandoval from San Antonio, Texas, are both walking the entire 160 miles.\nCarmosky said she came because she couldn't stand by while people's rights were crumbling.\n\"At this point, our rights have been so deeply eroded that it feels like a crisis,\" Carmosky said. \"I mean, it is a crisis. We have a constitution that no longer is respected by the leaders who … took an oath to defend it.\"\nFor Sandoval, it's important to march now in order to be a beacon of hope for Americans and show that people are willing to organize against despotism, he said.\nSandoval said he was inspired to march because of issues impacting his home state of Texas. He said he is concerned about Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the placement of the Ten Commandments in schoolrooms and political gerrymandering.\nThe march's focus on the Constitution also resonated with him, Sandoval said.\n\"We're like, 'hands off our Bill of Rights, our individual rights, our freedoms that make America great,'\" Sandoval said.\nPassersby were mostly supportive of the marchers as they traversed the road to Towson, honking in support. But there was a man who flipped the protesters off as he drove by.\n\"It's been a lot of positivity, for sure,\" Philadelphia resident Ashley Roman said. \"I think it's interesting how the haters come forward. It's like they're angry, but it's not really at us, it's more at their own actions.\"\nMarchers plan to arrive in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 17th and hold a rally on the National Mall, where political leaders like U.S. Rep.

    "content": "Viral vitriol: Workers are getting fired over social media posts celebrating Charlie Kirk's assassination\n\n September 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Adams MultiMedia | Section: News \n \n 1055\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Across the country, some people who have posted unsettling social media videos and messages celebrating the assassination of conservative activist and influencer Charlie Kirk are losing their jobs.Kirk, 31, was shot and killed by a sniper during a Sept. 10 rally at Utah Valley University.\nTyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Utah man, has been arrested and faces capital murder and other charges related to Kirk's killing.\nKirk was a top ally of President Donald Trump and popular with young conservatives and Evangelicals.\nThere are scores of TikTok and other social media videos and posts from progressives and other left-wing advocates celebrating Kirk's killing. Some claim Kirk's conservative messages are fascist, misogynist or racist. Others call him a Nazi.\nSome of Kirk's critics have posted videos of themselves singing and dancing to the conservative activist's assassination.\nBackers of Kirk and Trump have responded by reposting those social media communications, publishing information about their jobs and calling for the controversial posters to be fired from their jobs.\nAnd in some cases, that's exactly what's happening.\n\"Offensive or politically charged posts referencing figures like Charlie Kirk are often viewed as damaging to the employer's reputation, client relationships, or internal morale – grounds sufficient for immediate termination,\" said Chad Cummings, CEO and an attorney with Bonita Springs, Florida-based Cummings & Cummings Law.\nDanny Karon, an attorney and author who also teaches classes at law schools at Ohio State University and University of Michigan, said many employers have codes of conducts (including related to social media).\nKaron said First Amendment free speech exercises are not protected in the workplace and could be deemed cause for firings.\n\"Those words might be within the First Amendment, but you may be outside of your workplace's codes of conduct or ethics,\" said Karon, who is managing partner of Ohio-based law firm Karon LLC.\nAT-WILL TERMINATIONS\nFlorida-based Office Depot fired employees at a store in Michigan after they refused to print posters for a prayer vigil after Kirk's death.\nClemson University in South Carolina, Middle Tennessee State University, the Nasdaq stock exchange, the Carolina Panthers National Football League team, as well as hospitals, nonprofits and local school districts in Idaho, Florida and other states have fired or suspended employees who have glorified or cheered Kirk's murder.\n\"The majority of employees who are losing their jobs because of postings concerning Charlie Kirk are almost certainly at-will employees,\" said Christopher Migliaccio, an employment attorney and founder of the Dallas-based law firm Warren & Migliaccio LLP.\n\"This means an employer is able to terminate an employee for almost any reason that is not prohibited by law, such as discrimination or retaliation,\" Migliaccio said.\nMontana is the only U.S. state that limits at-will employment terminations. In Montana, such firings are allowed only during the first 12 months of employment.\nLaws in Montana and California also limit firing employees for social media posts unless employers can show harm to their business.\nNadine Jones, an attorney and founder of New Jersey-based General Counsel Support Services, recommends employers remind their staff of social media policies and to respect others' beliefs.\n\"My advice to companies would be to circulate their code of conduct to employees with an email cover citing to those sections talking about non-hostile work environments, no bullying, and about respecting each other's beliefs or positions,\" she said.\nOther employment attorneys say absent some kind of discriminatory enforcement, at-will terminations are difficult for workers to challenge, but there are instances where employers can face legal exposure.\n\"It would be extremely difficult for an employee to thread the needle to show discriminatory conduct by the employer based on a protected category (race, religion, sex, gender, marital status or disability) based on comments about Charlie Kirk's death,\" said Camron Dowlatshahi, partner with the MSD Attorneys, which has offices in Los Angeles and New York.\nCROSSING THE LINE\nBut there are some potential perils for employers.\n\"Employers could be accused of discrimination if they impose rules randomly, terminating one employee for damaging posts, but not terminating an employee who did something similar. In states that protect off-duty behavior, or where the employee has a contract or union protections,\" Migliaccio said.\nMore broadly, Cummings said social media terminations or sanctions against workers can run afoul of the National Labor Relations Act.\nThe New Deal era law strives to protect workers from being axed for talking about workplace matters and potential organizing.\nConservatives say Kirk was killed for his conservative and Christian beliefs.\nKirk was a strong backer and ally of President Trump. He also opposed abortion rights; diversity, equity and inclusion policies; and favored traditional Christian values.\n\"Charlie Kirk was assassinated because he was an outspoken Christian. This is undeniable,\" argues Bill Donahue, president of the Catholic League.\nSome of the controversial social media posts celebrating Kirk's assassination allude to his conservative Christian beliefs.\nOther conservatives view the slain influencer as a martyr.\n\"Charlie Kirk is a martyr. Martyrs create movements. We need more of this dialogue on our college campuses. But we can do that in a way like Charlie did. It was thoughtful dialogue,\" said U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Montana.\nCHILLING FREE SPEECH?\nSome free speech advocates have concerns about the chilling of discourse brought on by the firings.\n\"It's disgusting to see people using their freedom of speech to celebrate Charlie Kirk's murder on social media and further divide our country. I swore an oath to uphold the laws of Montana and our Constitution, including the freedom of speech, regardless of how vile it is,\" said Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte.\nThe Republican governor referenced a 2023 law passed to protect workers from dismissals for their social media posts.\nThe free speech group the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) is voicing concern about the chilling effects of the firing and lawmakers and other government officials pressing employers to fire workers over their Kirk posts.\nThat can amount to censorship via government pressure on the private sector, akin to conservatives' concerns during the pandemic and debates over vaccine mandates.\n\"As free speech advocates, it places us in a painful position. Charlie Kirk's assassination was an attack on free speech and open discourse. In a free society, we must not be afraid to express our views, no matter how strongly some might oppose them. That's the point of free speech,\" said FIRE Vice President Adam Goldstein. \"But it is precisely for that reason why we must not respond to mockery of Kirk's assassination by canceling everyone who offends us: because that too creates a society where people are afraid to express themselves.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Turning points? Perilous landscapes for media, free speech & political discourse after the killing of Charlie Kirk\n\n September 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: National \n \n 1462\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The maelstroms after the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk have created convergences and inflection points for social media, free speech and civil discourse across the U.S.Insensitive and offensive social media posts cheering Kirk's killing by a sniper during a rally at Utah Valley University Sept. 10 have resulted in some posters getting fired from their jobs. It has also prompted the Trump administration to talk about prosecuting and punishing \"hate speech.\"\nThe social media cheers of Kirk's murder also challenge longstanding societal norms \"not to speak ill of the dead.\"\nJared Meade, founder and principal of Rayne Strategy Group (a public relations firm with offices in Ohio and North Carolina), sees a conspiracy of contemporary uncivil discourse, social media echo chambers and people saying things online they might not utter in real-life settings.\n\"People are so quick to 'speak ill' of someone who has just died because the rhetoric and vitriol, particularly on both sides of the political spectrum, have become increasingly extreme and reckless,\" he said.\n\"When individuals like Charlie Kirk are labeled as Nazis, fascists, or similar dehumanizing terms, it has serious consequences. These labels strip these individuals of their humanity, creating a mindset where they are viewed as less than human. This makes it easier for society to dismiss and mistreat them or, as in the case of Charlie Kirk, incites violence,\" Meade said.\nKirk was CEO of Turning Point USA, a conservative group focused on college campuses. He was a top ally of President Donald Trump.\nA new poll by research YouGov shows 25% of Americans who are \"very liberal\" say political violence can be justified. Among self-identified \"liberals\", 17% say political violence can be justified. Overall, 26% of liberals under the age of 44 are okay with political violence in some instances.\nThat compares to 6% of conservatives and 3% of those who are very conservative, according to the YouGov poll.\nThose types of numbers and social media videos celebrating Kirk's death have prompted Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance and other conservatives to focus on violence from the political left.\n'ECHO CHAMBERS'Social media reactions hailing Kirk's killing display the current discord online and within American politics, according to Amore Philip, a PR strategist and founder of New York-based Apples & Oranges Public Relations.\n\"Cheering someone's death isn't politics; it's the loss of our humanity. Social media has turned ideology into a sport, and Charlie Kirk's killing is exposing just how dangerous that can be,\" Philip said.\nShe sees the Kirk killing and fallout as part of a bigger societal challenge.\n\"The bigger picture is this: Social media has created echo chambers where people defend their 'sides' rather than viewing issues empathetically. It rewards outrage, piling on, and polarization, as evident in this instance,\" Phillip said.\n\"The question isn't just about Kirk; it's about where we stand as a society when free speech becomes weaponized and death becomes mere content. At its core, this moment should remind us that political disagreement should never overshadow our ability to value human life or engage in meaningful dialogue,\" she continued.\nRania Sedhom, managing partner of New York-based Sedhom Law Group, also sees wider ramifications from Kirk's assassination.\n\"He was silenced by a 22-year old who disagreed with him. The repercussions of this form of expression permeates through our everyday lives,\" Sedhom said.\n\"Who is up for debate? How are people communicating? The workplace is fundamentally changed. Water cooler talk? Too risky. Discussions about anything of relevance? Too risky. Stating your opinion? Too risky,\" she said.\nStill, Meade sees some benefits brought by our social media-dominated discourse. \"Social media is a double-edged sword. It offers a platform for those who otherwise wouldn't have a voice. It provides opportunities for connection, information sharing and community building on a global scale,\" he said.\n'FREED\nOM TO WOUND'\nSome of the social media reactions cheering Kirk's murder are viewed as poor form, according to etiquette experts.\n\"Good behavior is more than table manners — it's the daily practice of respect, restraint, and compassion. After 25 years as an etiquette expert, I see how often we confuse freedom of speech with freedom to wound,\" said Lisa Mirza Grotts, a California-based etiquette expert, \"The Charlie Kirk murder was a bridge too far.\"\nShe says America has lost its behavioral compass.\n\"I'm struck by how far we've drifted from simple decency. We shout instead of listen, demand agreement instead of understanding,\" Mizra Grotts said.\nKevin Angelo Brown, a criminologist and criminal justice professor at Arkansas State University, said the saying and norm of 'not speaking ill of the dead' dates back to the 6th Century BC and ancient Greece and Sparta and carried into Roman and other Western cultures with the Latin phrase 'de mortuis nil nisi bonum,' meaning 'of the dead, say nothing but good.'\nBill Villanova, president of Frank E. Campbell: The Funeral Chapel in New York, said holding your tongue regarding the recently passed has been a \"longstanding tradition\", but the spontaneity and perceived anonymity of social media has changed that.\nStill, Villanova, whose funeral home has organized services for notable persons such as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Joan Rivers, John Lennon and Heath Ledger, said social media can also produce well wishers sharing stories about a departed person's positive impacts.\n'RISING CONTRADICTIONS'Kirk's assassination and the ugly aftermath online are also magnifying workplace, social media and political intersections with free speech rights.\nEmployees have been learning their social media posts regarding Kirk can have repercussions, including losing their jobs.\n\"The current dynamic highlights the rising contradiction between professional accountability in private employment and free expression in the public domain,\" said Edward Hones, owner of Seattle-based Hones Law, of workers and executives losing their jobs for their posts, mostly under at-will employment arrangements.\nOn Thursday, the Walt Disney Co. said it was indefinitely pulling ABC late night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air after he made comments Monday that Kirk's alleged assassin was \"anything but one of them\", referring to Trump's Make America Great Again \"MAGA gang.\"\nUtah prosecutors said in charging documents on Tuesday that Robinson told his parents that he killed the conservative Kirk because \"there is too much evil and the guy [Charlie Kirk] spreads too much hate.\"\nDisney ABC yanked Kimmel off the air after Nexstar Broadcasting and later Sinclair Broadcasting said they would stop airing the late-night show on their local stations after the Kirk comments.\nTrump welcomed Kimmel's indefinitely shelving as \"great news for America\" and said the ABC host was shelved for poor ratings.\nFree speech advocates and Democrats decried the move, pointing to Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr's criticisms of the ABC host. They say the Trump administration pressured Disney/ABC to nix Kimmel's show.\n\"This marks a dark new level of capitulation and censorship of speech more redolent of autocracies than democracies. The Trump administration's regulatory crusade against free speech has crossed an historic line with the indefinite removal of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' — an act of government-instigated censorship against satire and comedy,\" said Summer Lopez, interim co-CEO of Pen America. The group advocates for writers, literature and free speech.\nThe Trump administration — including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Vance — have talked about going after \"hate speech\", stemming from the Kirk fallout and their contentions that liberal and far-left groups rhetoric demonize Trump and his supporters.\n\"Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is not protected by the First Amendment. It's a crime. For far too long, we've watched the radical left normalize threats, call for assassinations, and cheer on political violence. That era is over,\" Bondi said in a statement.\nSecretary of War Pete Hegseth has also ordered the U.S. military to identify and sanction personnel who have celebrated Kirk's assassination online.\n'ABSOLUTELY CHILLING'Trump said Thursday he was designating the anti-fascist, left-wing ANTIFA activist movement as terrorists. ANTIFA is a collection of smaller left-wing activist groups, opposed to Trump and right-wingers.\nConservatives point to instances of violence and vandalism perpetrated by self-proclaimed ANTIFA protesters and activists, including in the Pacific Northwest.\n\"President Trump is right. ANTIFA is a dangerous, radical group that thrives on chaos and violence. Rightfully declaring them a terrorist organization will help protect our communities,\" said U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a conservative Republican representing Maryland's Eastern Shore. \"It's time to investigate those who fund them and stop the lawlessness once and for all.\"\nThere is pushback from the left over whether Trump has the power to designate domestic advocates as terrorists and how the government and police will treat left-wing opponents.\nFree speech advocates also note that controversial or unpopular speech is protected under the First Amendment as long as it does not incite violence or make violent threats.\n\"This is absolutely chilling. It's why carving out a 'hate speech' exception to the First Amendment is so dangerous. It grants the government the power not only to decide what constitutes hateful speech, but to punish it,\" said the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), a free speech group, in a statement. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He briefly served as an elected commissioner for the Town of St. Michaels in 2008 and 2009.\nWalish said he is running because he believes he could do a better job representing the Eastern Shore and responding to residents' needs than Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md. 1st). Harris has represented the district in Congress since 2010.\n\"The first week that you could register in February, I was there,\" Walish said. \"In fact, I was there on the second day, and I was just determined that I could do a better job.\"\nWalish had a seven-month stint as a commissioner of St. Michaels, until he resigned amid controversy surrounding the never-constructed Miles Point subdivision. Walish opposed a growth allocation awarded to the property's developer, which had been a key issue of his campaign, he said.\nWhen he resigned in 2009, Walish wrote in his resignation letter that \"It has become increasingly apparent over the last half of 2008 that it will not be possible to accomplish for the voters of St. Michaels the initiatives that I was elected to deliver to them.\"\nWhile Walish left only seven months into the office, he said he wanted to assure the Eastern Shore residents that he is not a quitter.\n\"I worked for the same company for 30 years. I was married to the same person for 33 years. So, I'm not a quitter,\" Walish said.\nWalish's business career includes leadership tenures with Xerox Corporation, Chrysler and BMW, where he became one of the company's youngest senior executives in North America.\nAs BMW's senior executive, he led the entire company's integration of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and chaired BMW's Diversity Committee. Under his leadership, BMW expanded diversity efforts across its workforce.\nWalish plans to focus on the health of the Chesapeake Bay if elected. He said he would also support farmers and watermen.\n\"For example, farmers are really having a tough time right now, and I would definitely support some sort of program that would help them,\" he said.\nThe 2026 primary election is scheduled for June, with the general election to follow in November. The winner will represent Maryland's 1st District in the U.S. House of Representatives for a two-year term. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Constitution attempted to create better world\n\n September 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KARY LOVE | Section: Columns \n \n 824\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Do you remember that before July 4, 1776, 99% of the people living in the world and 99% of those who had lived and were dead, had lived as slaves, serfs, peasants or indentured servants, and that only kings, emperors and lords had rights?Of course over human history many had fought for human rights. Over time, a tidal wave supporting human rights emerged among humans as the many suffered the cruelty and arbitrary rule of those unaccountable to the people — kings and their ilk.\nIn what I regard as the greatest political legal achievement in history, America threw off the tyranny of \"kings and aristocrats\" and established a \"government of the people, by the people and for the people.\"\nThe Constitution of September 17, 1787, was an imperfect effort to establish a better world with a government subject to the rule of law, wherein the people were represented by the law makers who had a duty to see the will of the people adopted into the nation's laws. Of course, the Constitution was not perfect at birth and the amendment process was included should it need alteration as issues emerged.\nThe 1787 Constitution was written in secret by the \"1% of the day\" and represented a retreat from the more universal declarations of human rights expressed in Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. The perpetual struggle between the interests of the few at the top and of the many below did not end with the revolution nor the Constitution. The revolutionary generation was appalled by the Constitution and demanded a Bill of Rights protecting the human rights the American Revolution bled and died to achieve be made part of, and enforceable against government, under the \"Supreme Law.\"\nFaced with an overwhelming reaction against the proposed Constitution, in order to get state conventions to agree to it, the \"Federalists\" agreed that the first order of business of the Congress once the Constitution was ratified would be to adopt a Bill of Rights demanded by the people. James Madison primarily whittled those down to the first 10 amendments, adopted in 1791, to appease American Revolutionaries and their families who demanded that the revolution's great achievements be written into law.\nHowever, despite a Bill of Rights, America suffered under a continued struggle between power and the people. As a result the various interests fought over \"representation\" because that was where the foundation of power lay under the Constitution. One Amendment submitted early on raised the issue of what representation was needed if the people were truly to have input into how their government mutated and ruled going forward. Making sure sufficient representatives were present to cover the divergent interests of the people was debated and the Congressional Apportionment Amendment was one submitted by the states to ensure representation not be diluted.\nAs James Madison wrote, in Federalist Paper No. 55:\n[F]irst, that so small a number of representatives will be an unsafe depositary of the public interests; secondly, that they will not possess a proper knowledge of the local circumstances of their numerous constituents; thirdly, that they will be taken from that class of citizens which will sympathize least with the feelings of the mass of the people, and be most likely to aim at a permanent elevation of the few on the depression of the many.\nThe congressional apportionment amendment suggested one representative for every 30,000 people, eventually increasing to one for every 50,000. This amendment was never ratified. In 1929, the House was frozen by Congress at 435 members, leading to larger districts and a growing number of constituents per representative.\nToday, each representative serves approximately 760,000 constituents, a significant dilution of actual ability of \"representatives\" to represent the people. One contemplates this dilution of representation is manifested in our current dissatisfaction with our federal government; after all, our nation was founded in part on the cry \"no taxation without representation,\" because unless the people consented to the use of their money by meaningful representative government, the founding generation called such taxation without representation mere \"theft.\" Today taxation without real representation results in use of tax dollars for purposes most Americans oppose but that benefit a \"select\" few.\nAs Constitution Day was celebrated this week, Americans ought reflect on the fact that lack of meaningful representation has diluted their status as Americans who self-govern. They ought reflect on the fact the Bill of Rights enshrining their human rights in the supreme law is being diluted by laws passed by unrepresentative congresses and executive orders issued in defiance of the supreme law.\nNeither the Constitution nor the Bill of Rights descends from the heavens to preserve the greatness of America. Both require active support daily by the people in order to live and survive the grasping hands of those who disdain government by the people preferring government by money. The continuation of the great revolution for human rights, equality before law and justice for all, begun at the founding of America, is the duty of every American. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "We need more conversation, not assassination\n\n September 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: GLENN MOLLETTE | Section: Columns \n \n 565\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Charlie Kirk was a man who had opinions and vocalized them. He believed in free speech. He also believed in the right of free speech for those who disagreed with him. In his Turning Point rallies, he gave untold numbers of people the opportunity to express their opinions and to debate him. He respectfully gave each person the time to state their case on whatever the subject. Charlie was adamant, profound and articulated strong convictions.Sadly, a deranged 22-year-old man from Utah allegedly took Charlie's life. It has been reported that the suspected gunman had previously stated at a family dinner that he thought Kirk was filled with hate. When Kirk spoke at a university rally in Utah, the gunman plotted and positioned himself to shoot a single long-range rifle shot that took Kirk's life. The suspect ran back to his home where he reportedly later had no choice but to confess to his father that he was indeed the man who had been videotaped at the rally who took Charlie Kirk's life.\nThe lone assassin is an evil coward who silenced one of America's star voices. At least he thought he did. Charlie Kirk has become more known and his sound clips have been heard more in the last few days than in his entire ministry and career. Kirk has been propelled by the assassin to a status in American culture that will never be forgotten. Instead of silencing Kirk he magnified Kirk's voice and message a hundred or more times. Kirk is now being remembered around the world.\nCharlie Kirk used his voice. Every American is entitled to this freedom. His voice cost him his life.\nAbraham Lincoln gave his life reuniting our country and abolishing slavery. A cowardly assassin took Lincoln's life as he leisurely watched a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C.\nJohn F. Kennedy used his voice to excite the American people and to bring about a positive attitude in the country but was gunned down by an assassin from a hidden window in downtown Dallas, Texas.\nMartin Luther King, Jr. was a man with a great voice who stirred the hearts of millions of Americans and brought about liberating change for Black Americans. An assassin who disagreed with King cowardly hid and took King's life with a bullet.\nMalcom X and Bobby Kennedy were orators for positive change in America but someone who disagreed with their views killed them.\nThe greatest voice of hope, love, change and forgiveness, who ever lived, was Jesus Christ. A cowardly crowd yelled for him to be executed.\nThese mentioned voices were not silenced by hideous crowds or hidden gunmen. Each of their voices have rung loudly and clearly. Their legacies have only grown bolder and stronger.\nIt is sad that Charlie Kirk's assassin did not go down to the rally, stand up like a man and challenge Kirk in a debate. He could have told Kirk what he thought about him and given Kirk a chance to respond. But, no, he was a weak, spineless man filled with more hate than probably anyone in America at that given moment. It's one thing to have a hateful, negative thought, but it's another to allow hate to act itself out in such a way.\nViolence is never the answer. Let's keep America free. Free to speak, free to debate, free to practice and express our religion. Let's have peaceful and strong conversation not assassination. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Charlie Kirk relished engagement with critics\n\n September 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Columns \n \n 725\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Charlie Kirk — a conservative political activist, co-founder of Turning Point USA and ally of President Trump — was assassinated Sept. 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.Charlie had a huge following of supporters who strongly agreed with his conservative values and views. He also had a huge following of detractors who strongly disagreed with him.\nThis column will not focus on defending or challenging his views on the issues of the day.\nIn today's deeply divided world, an effort to change strongly held views is an exercise in futility.\nInstead I will focus on how he conducted himself in expressing and discussing his views.\nIn watching videos of Charlie's events with large crowds of mostly young people, college students and high school students, I was always impressed with how different those engagements were in contrast to much of the political debates in our society.\nCharlie presented his strongly held views without being aggressive or condescending. He always listened intently and respectfully to those who strongly disagreed with his views. He regularly took questions, answered questions and listened to criticism of his views.\nHe encouraged and relished direct engagement with supporters and critics alike.\nAt the opening of his events, he often told attendees — if you disagree with my views, come to the front of the line so we can share and talk about our respective positions.\nHe was the epitome of a person who could disagree without being disagreeable.\nDespite his civil approach in delivering, defending and discussing his beliefs, he was regularly branded by his opponents as, among other things, a misogynist, racist, transphobic, homophobic, fascist, Nazi and a Hitler.\nImmediately following his death and since then, there have been countless people saying or writing they condone, support, justify or are actually celebrating Kirk's murder.\nThey have a constitutional right to do that. They do not have human decency.\nThey do not understand or commit to the belief that every human life has value deserving protection and respect.\nThat is true even when that human expresses his or her beliefs that his or her opponents may strongly disagree with or even abhor without being murdered.\nMao Zedong, longtime leader of China, once said, \"Politics is war without bloodshed, while war is politics with bloodshed.\"\nCurrently in America, politics has become war with bloodshed.\nThis lack of civil discourse and respect for differing opinions is not exclusive to any religious affiliation or political party.\nIn just the past few months, two children were murdered, and seventeen people were injured when a shooter opened fire during worship in a Catholic school in Minnesota. The shooter's manifesto described his hatred of Blacks, Hispanics, Christians, Jews and President Trump.\nAlso in Minnesota, a pro-abortion rights Democratic — Farm-Labor Party state representative was murdered along with her husband. A fellow pro-abortion rights Democratic -Farm — Labor Party State Senator, and his wife were shot by the same individual, but both survived the attempted murder. The murderer is an anti-abortion advocate.\nMurders of children, elected public officials and political activists such as Charlie Kirk are more than tragedies.\nThey are a further indication of a warp speed acceleration in our society on the decline of civil discourse and decency, and the desensitization of the loss of human life.\nNext year will mark 250 years of America's experiences with free speech and civil discourse on and a wide range of divisive issues.\nI am increasingly uncertain free speech and civil discourse in America will ever return.\nIn the book, \"Poorer Richard's America,\" there is an ominous suggestion that Charles Darwin's \"Theory of Organic Evolution: Natural Selection,\" applies not only to nature but also to nations.\nOne example is Great Britain.\nAt one time, Great Britain was the most powerful nation in the world.\nIt was often said, \"The sun never sets on the British Empire.\"\nAfter the end of World War II, Great Britain declined rapidly as a great world power.\nSome suggest that America is on a path to do the same and will do so sooner rather than later.\nThat outcome is not inevitable.\nAlexis de Tocqueville, a 19th century French diplomat, political scientist and social critic suggested that \"America is great because America is good. If America ever ceases to be good, it will cease to be great.\"\nIt is not too late for Americans, individually and collectively, to strive to be good with a renewed commitment to freedom of speech, civil discourse and respect for all people, all ideas and all beliefs. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Former FCC leaders weigh in on Kimmel suspension\n\n September 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The nearly week-long suspension of late-night show host Jimmy Kimmel, which was imposed by ABC after Kimmel drew backlash for comments he made in the wake of the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, quickly became the center of a national conversation on press freedoms.It was a conversation two former Federal Communications Commission chairs, both Talbot County residents, were watching closely.\nThe suspension was imposed by ABC last Wednesday after Kimmel said supporters of the Trump administration were \"working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.\" Kimmel returned to the air Tuesday evening.\nBut the initial decision to remove Kimmel from his position raised concerns for former FCC Chair under Republican President George H.W. Bush Al Sikes, who said the current pressure on media, exemplified by incidents like Kimmel being pulled off air, is unprecedented and prevents individuals and organizations from pushing back.\nKimmel's suspension came amid recent pressure put on media outlets by the Trump administration to cover the president more favorably. The president has often complained of what he says is an asymmetry between critical press coverage and the views of the American people as exemplified by his victory in 2024.\nBrendan Carr, the current head of the FCC, issued a warning prior to Kimmel's suspension while speaking on the Benny Johnson podcast. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said. \"These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"\nFormer FCC Chair under Democratic President Barack Obama Tom Wheeler critiqued Carr. Wheeler clained the FCC chair is pursuing a coercive approach to content and ownership, despite statutory prohibitions on content censorship, First Amendment protections, and 90 years of FCC policy promoting diversity of voices and ownership.\nCarr authored these concepts into a chapter of Project 2025, a political initiative to reshape the federal government in favor of right-wing policies written ahead of the 2024 election.\nIn the plan, Carr called for a balanced approach to regulation in the tech space, one that would protect free speech, promote competition and foster innovation without allowing government overreach.\nWheeler said recent FCC actions contrasts with Project 2025, citing Carr's recent messaging that \"We're not done yet. There will be a massive shift in dynamics in the media ecosystem, and we are operating under a permission structure provided by President Trump's election.\"\nCarr's messaging raises multiple concerns for Sikes, but the greatest is self-censorship, which he says is a harmful issue that ill-serves the nation.\n\"We are engaged in a level of self-censorship that is really quite harmful, by which I mean we choose to read people that we agree with or that agree with us, and we tend to get into these little narrow corridors,\" Sikes said.\nSikes said media entities are also complicit in censorship because litigation is too costly.\nIn December 2024, ABC settled a $15 million libel lawsuit with then President-elect Donald Trump and agreed to issue an apology.\n\"I think that ABC thought, 'okay, well, this is our blood money. We'll pay this. We'll get it all behind us.' But really what this taught is, for a bully, if you find you can bully them once, you can bully them twice,\" Wheeler said.\nWheeler linked the rapid move to take Kimmel off the air to Nexstar Media Group's dependence on FCC favor, saying Nexstar has more than two dozen ABC affiliate stations and pressured ABC after Kimmel's remarks.\nAccording to Wheeler, there has been limited judicial review of FCC actions because Carr has been acting informally, not in his official capacity as FCC chair. Judicial review can only occur when formal decisions are made.\n\"ABC could have stood up and said, 'No, we'll challenge you in court for violation of the First Amendment.' But they didn't because it was easier to buckle,\" he said.\nSikes anticipates that there will be further levels of censorship and more firings like Kimmel's. \"It's hard to know how all of this is going to unfold. I mean, we're literally in the very, very early stages,\" Sikes said.\nWheeler said electoral change and a non-beholden Congress are key remedies, emphasizing that citizens have the opportunity to \"send a message\" in 2026. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-09-27",
    "author": "DAVID REEL",
    "content": "State has a fair system available for redistricting\n\n September 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 814\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. Constitution requires that district boundaries for representation in the U.S. House of Representatives be based on state population as determined by the results of a national census that is conducted every 10 years.In many states, including Maryland, drawing these district boundaries is done by the state legislature subject to final approval of the governor. In such states, redistricting is regularly characterized by gerrymandering, the practice of drawing the boundaries in a way that gives one political party a distinct advantage in elections. Gerrymandering has been pursued aggressively by the Democratic and the Republican parties, depending on which party controls a state legislature and the governorship.\nFollowing one reapportionment in Maryland, former Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley testified under oath: \"I did everything in my power to draw a map that would be more favorable to the election of a Democratic congressional delegation.\"\nRecently, at the urging of President Trump, Republicans in the Texas state legislature launched a successful effort to discard the historical every 10-year redistricting schedule and redraw congressional district boundaries before the 2026 midterm elections.\nTheir goal was simple — to enhance the prospects for Republican candidates to flip seats currently held by Democratic members in the U.S. House. That would help Republicans maintain or expand their current House majority for the last two years of a Trump presidency.\nIsaac Newton once noted that in physics, for every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction. That is true in politics as well.\nFollowing the gerrymandering in Texas, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has raised $70 million for Proposition 50, a reapportionment referendum initiative. That amount includes $10 million from George Soro's Open Society Foundation. Proposition 50's goal is also simple — to enhance the prospects for Democratic candidates to flip seats currently held by Republican members in the U.S. House.\nLegislation also has been introduced in the Maryland House of Delegates and the Maryland Senate for congressional district reapportionment to be done sooner rather than later.\nState Sen. Clarence Lam, a sponsor of Senate legislation has said, \"If red states want to redistrict early, with the goal of picking up additional seats in Congress, blue states should do the same.\"\nOne proposal of Sen. Lam would have a disproportionate impact on the Eastern Shore. If approved all of the Eastern Shore counties would not be in one congressional district, as they are now. Mid and lower Eastern Shore counties would be in a new congressional district (District 1) along with parts of Anne Arundel County. Cecil County and a part of Harford County would be in a new Congressional District 2 with parts of Baltimore County and Baltimore City. The rest of Harford County would be in a new Congressional District 3 with parts of Baltimore City and Howard County.\nIf an accelerated reapportionment effort in Maryland goes forward, there is a better way to proceed.\nIn 2021, former Gov. Hogan issued an executive order creating the Maryland Citizens Redistricting Commission.\nThe commission had nine members from across Maryland — three Democrats, three Republicans and three independents. Stanford Law School Professor Nathaniel Persily, an expert on voting rights and election law, served as an adviser for the commission.\nThe commission's final report issued in November 2021 included the following observations: \"The lines were drawn without regard to the interests of any party or candidate and without taking into account the place of residence of any incumbent officeholder or other potential candidate, nor did we consider how residents of any community may have voted in the past, or with what political party they may be registered. The Citizens Commission believes its maps embody good redistricting principles, including compactness, minimal splits of counties and municipalities, and a highly understandable layout for congressional representation. Additionally, they offer better adherence to the principle of \"one person, one vote\" through a closer approach than in past maps to population equality. We are proud that our proposed congressional and senate maps earned a rating of \"A\" for partisan fairness from the Princeton Gerrymandering Project.\"\nAt the final meeting, Professor Persily told commission members their efforts should be held out as a national model for the way things should be done.\nA majority in the General Assembly did not share that conclusion. The state Senate approved their own version of congressional district boundaries with yes votes from all the Democratic senators and no votes from all the Republican senators. The state House concurred with 90 yes votes from Democratic delegates and no votes from 40 Republican delegates and 1 Democratic delegate. Accepting political reality that resistance was futile, Gov. Hogan signed the redistricting legislation. Afterwards Bloomberg Governments' Greg Giroux wrote, \"The new map will continue to favor Democrats in seven of eight districts.\nIn these uncertain political times only one thing is certain.\nReapportionment in Maryland will remain politicized with gerrymandered results unless citizens demand legislative approval of reapportionment recommendations developed by a group comparable to the 2021 Maryland Citizens Redistricting Commission. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "As state politicians play blame game, federal offices shut down\n\n October 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 895\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On Day 1 of the federal government's first shutdown in nearly seven years, Maryland politicians placed blame across partisan lines for the spending plan that stalled out in the U.S. Senate Tuesday night.Legislators couldn't reach a compromise to keep government appropriations flowing, with health care dollars the main point of contention. Senate Democrats lobbied for a spending plan to extend soon-to-expire tax subsidies in the Affordable Care Act. It would have avoided a shutdown through October. Senate Republicans rejected that proposal.\nRepublicans' plan, which would fund the government through Nov. 21, fell five votes short. A vote held in the Senate on Wednesday failed to end the shutdown.\nIn an interview late Wednesday morning, Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) blamed Senate Democrats, including Maryland's Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks, who both voted against the GOP proposal.\n\"Because so many Marylanders are federal employees, I think that the two senators should realize that will harm a lot of Marylanders,\" said Harris, whose district includes the Eastern Shore and who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus. \"Maybe one of them changes their mind, but I'm not holding my breath waiting for that.\"\nAt a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, Alsobrooks placed the onus on Republicans for allowing the shutdown — which she called \"foreseeable.\"\n\"This is their shutdown, and anyone who says anything different than that is dishonest,\" Alsobrooks said, citing the GOP's control of the White House and both the House and Senate. \"They have the keys to the kingdom.\"\nAlsobrooks and Van Hollen, along with House Democrats from Maryland, cited a potential implosion of health care costs as a reason why they aren't willing to budge on their spending plan. The plan would restore cuts to Medicaid made in Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill this summer in addition to extending the health care subsidies.\nAccording to an analysis by the nonprofit health policy organization KFF, health insurance premiums could more than double if the subsidies are not extended past the end of this year.\nHarris said he opposes new spending proposals from Democrats, in part, due to the claim echoed by many Republicans that they would give \"health care to illegal immigrants.\"\nVan Hollen on Wednesday called that talking point a \"big lie.\"\nUndocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal health insurance programs, including Medicaid, but Medicaid may offer reimbursements to help cover emergencies for undocumented immigrants who would otherwise qualify for the program.\nThe Big Beautiful Bill does reduce these reimbursements, which accounted for less than 1% of Medicaid spending in past years, according to KFF.\nEmployees furloughed\nMany full-time federal employees were furloughed Wednesday, including those on the Eastern Shore.\nUSDA Farm Service Agency offices in Easton and Denton were closed Wednesday. Voicemail greetings indicated employees were furloughed and did not have access to emails.\nThe Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge posted on Facebook that its page would not be updated during the shutdown. Calls to the refuge, which is run by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, were not returned Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard station in Oxford remains open. Bryant Gooch, executive petty officer, told The Star Democrat that the site \"will remain operational.\"\nMaryland Democrats touched on the status of federal employees during their press conference.\n\"We want to make sure that federal government employees and federal contractors do not bear the brunt of this shutdown,\" Van Hollen said. \"We want to provide them with relief.\"\nVan Hollen touted Gov. Wes Moore's (D) efforts to assist the state's federal employees and contractors, which were announced Wednesday morning. A new page on the state's official website consolidates potential relief for furloughed employees in one place.\nLayoffs may loom\nAmid the shutdown, legislators are sparring over Trump's vows to layoff more federal employees.\nHarris said if the shutdown continues, he's \"sure that the layoff proposals are gonna come in the next few days.\"\n\"I think they look at this as an opportunity to make the efficiency changes that the federal government needs, and this is the perfect opportunity to do it,\" Harris said of Trump and the Office of Management and Budget, which has headed an effort to reduce the federal workforce since Trump took office.\nVan Hollen said the shutdown doesn't give Trump more legal leeway to enact layoffs but instead makes that plan of action more difficult.\n\"If they continue to do it, we will be in court first thing the next morning with our documents to get people their jobs back,\" said Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) of potential layoffs.\nHow long?\nThe U.S. government last shut down in December 2018 and January 2019 for a record 34 days. It's unclear just how long the current standoff will persist.\nHarris said he could see one or two Senate Democrats flipping their votes each day until the 60-vote minimum to pass a spending plan is met.\n\"That could be late this week, that could be early next week,\" he said. \" ... We need to get the government open and running.\"\nVan Hollen said the position of Democrats in Congress is \"crystal clear\" in regards to restoring funding: \"We're not going to give a blank check to a lawless president.\"\nHarris, meanwhile, said the central focus should be on reopening the government. Then lawmakers can debate whether to extend health care subsidies closer to their expiration at the end of December, he said.\nVan Hollen doesn't buy that line of thinking.\n\"We've seen this play before,\" he said. \"These are always empty promises, empty statements.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Democrats must rebuild trust with working class, speaker tells Citizens Connect\n\n October 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 943\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Democrats must rebuild trust with rural and working-class voters by listening to their grievances and acknowledging valid reasons for their economic frustration, Anthony Flaccavento told a Citizens Connect gathering Sept. 15 at the Kent Cultural Alliance Center.Flaccavento, co-founder and executive director of the Rural Urban Bridge Initiative, said the Democrats lost the trust of many rural working class and urban working class throughout the years, culminating with the election of President Donald Trump.\nTrump increased support among rural and working class while Democrats lost that support, Flaccavento pointed out.\nHe presented reasons why but also shared hope how to restore trust.\nFlaccavento quoted from minority leader Chuck Schumer on the eve of the 2016 election when he said for every blue collar Democrat they lost they can pick up two moderate Republicans.\nBut they did not pick up either one, Flaccavento noted.\nDuring those elections, rural and blue collar voters moved to Trump with a percentage increase among Blacks and Hispanics, he said. The increase among the Democrats were college-educated and middle, high class and wealthy.\n\"That is essentially our base now,\" he said. \"The problem on the left was we weren't able to convince enough people of the threat Trump posed. Focusing too much on that failed to persuade swing voters.\"\nBut that was not the blame of all conservatives, he said, and indicated his own party.\n\"We (the left) tend to psychoanalyze the people who would vote for him are bad people or are incapable of hearing us because we believe we have the right message.\"\nBut Flaccavento said there were some valid reasons to vote for Trump, and not just simply his supporters were racists, homophobes and bigots. Trump voters believed the system is rigged, the lecturer noted.\nAre they right? Flaccavento said President Ronald Reagan's trickle down economics did not create a trickle down effect. It benefitted the top 20 percent, he said. The urban and rural working class, especially people of color, faced economic insecurity.\nThis wealth discrepancy was bipartisan in some aspects. He observed President Bill Clinton repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, adding to economic instability. Under Clinton, trade policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement and pushing for China's entry into the World Trade Organization destabilized things.\nThrough these policies, Flaccavento said people's claim the system was rigged had validity among many from both sides. Trump used it, so did 2016 presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders.\nWith the belief of a rigged system grew an anti-elitism sentiment, Flaccavento said. When talking with Trump supporters, the cry against injustice against the elite was mingled into the other messages.\nWhat about the messengers of the elites? The experts? Flaccavento said they also were not trusted. Is there any validity to that? Flaccavento said yes. The experts told the nation that the North American Free Trade Agreement would create a million new jobs over the first five years. It did not, he pointed out.\nFlaccavento cited \"Hands Across the Hills,\" a dialogue and exchange project after the 2016 election when residents of Letcher County, Kentucky, and Leverett, Massachusetts, came together to understand each other better.\nIn the example Flaccavento presented, they asked someone in Kentucky why they did not believe the experts over the importance of vaccines. That person told them these same experts said OxyContin was perfectly safe and not addictive.\nWith some of those strong examples of reasons to question authority, still the left overlooked that and tend to ridicule Trump supporters, Flaccavento observed. Circling back to Trump, he said his supporters held him as the lone figure that could tear down a system which has not worked for the working class in decades. That is one of the reasons the base grew, he said.\nBut for Democrats, Flaccavento said, there is hope.\nHe called for the left to acknowledge the resentment the working class feel. Listening intently to the other side while also self-reflecting on their own side's flaws, he said, is effectual.\n\"We (on the left) carry biases into this. We might think we're beyond that, but we're not,\" he said.\nIn order to reestablish trust, Flaccavento said, they have to reach out to the community.\nHe urged them to not be overly obsessed with Trump, causing those who may be turning against him to start defending him again. He also said avoid ridicule and bumper stickers which scream, \"I'm right!\"\nFlaccavento noted that Trump's bad policies are being noticed. Within a group of people whose approval of Trump is \"underwater\" are about 10 percent of former Trump voters who they could win over, but not with current tactics of the Democratic Party.\nFlaccavento started the Beyond the Resistance Campaign for that reason. \"We reach out to working class folks and lift up their concerns.\"\nAnd reaching beyond the political is vital to their goal. \"It's about local Democrat committees working with non Democrats doing concrete community action. For some that is helping to fix a roof. To others it would be to feed the needy or deliver firewood. It is important to be seen in the community without just showing up and protesting.\"\nSince then they have conducted several events and are seeing progress. \"To preserve our democracy and to rebuild our fractured nation, we need to mobilize a much broader, more diverse base of people, including rural and working-class people across race and geography. To do this, we must offer a vision that addresses the grievances of rural communities and working-class people. Rebuild trust. That's the baseline.\"\nCitizens Connect, formed by Chestertown residents Joan Caivano and Eileen Kessler, is a forum designed to find common ground among people who disagree politically. The group was inspired by Washington College's class \"Bridging the Divide\" and held its first meeting in August.\nYou can find them on Facebook or email info@citizensconnectkc.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The officials do not suffer, they take a vacation due to previously scheduled holidays.\nAs an American taxpayer who votes, I hired these people to do their job and work for the good of all Americans, regardless of party affiliation.\nFiring the lot of them will take time and will only bring in incompetent replacements. In order to make these worthless individuals feel the consequences of their behavior, I propose the following.\nWhen it is evident that a government shutdown is imminent, all members of the House and Senate will be locked in their respective chambers until such time as they work out an acceptable compromise.\nAs time passes without progress, bathroom breaks and food deliveries can be increasingly limited. Communication with the rest of the nation will be cut off until a compromise is reached. Medical professionals can be on hand to deal with any real or imagined medical issues. The only time a representative can leave the building ahead of a compromise is if they are deceased.\nFaced with such draconian measures, I am confident that these representatives will quickly find a way to reach a compromise and do the jobs that they were hired to do.\nMARK MALPHRUS\nRidgely \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Kirk did not invite conversation\n\n October 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 352\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Let me say at the start that like almost all Americans I deplore the murder of Charlie Kirk. But I want to challenge the opinion pieces by Glen Mollette and David Reel in the Sunday Star Weekend Edition of Sept. 20-21.The headlines accurately sum up their views: \"We need more conversation, not assassination\" and \"Charlie Kirk relished engagement with critics.\" I believe that Kirk's behavior exhibited neither conversation nor engagement.\nWikipedia tells us that \"conversation\" is an ambiguous word. The only common element in its various meanings is that it involves at least two people.\nAt the modest end of the spectrum of meanings one might imagine two people talking about the day's weather. At the other end is something like discussion, wherein two or more people seek a richer understanding of some topic that interests them.\nMany commentators, like your two opinion writers, seem to imply that Kirk's activity was of this sort. I believe it was not.\nKirk's behavior in his Q & A sessions were notable for his polite, respectful listening, which implied that he was open to changing his views — if only he could find someone to persuade him otherwise.\nThis apparent open mindedness seems to have disarmed some of his critics who, like Reel, were charmed by Kirk's manner even while finding his positions disreputable — even despicable. He was never bombastic; he did not promote demonstrations (or worse) on behalf of his views.\nWhat gets lost in appraisals of his mission are his actual beliefs and values, which then go unchallenged — and his offer to be proven wrong has effectively diverted away from them.\nFurthermore, there is no way to prove Kirk's views wrong (nor to prove right the views opposing his). These are not matters of proof but rather beliefs involving strongly held assumptions and values.\nIn sum, Kirk's mantra \"Prove me wrong,\" stated by him over and over– and posted prominently on overhangs of tents at his meetings – while seeming to ask for a counter argument, is a hollow request. It does not invite conversation at all — and certainly not conversation in pursuit of further understanding.\nFOREST HANSEN\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Do not ignore escalating signs of authoritarianism\n\n October 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LARRY PIFER | Section: Columns \n \n 504\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The deployment of National Guard troops and regular military in Washington, D.C,. Los Angles and now Portland, Oregon, is not OK.Nor is Trump's directive \"we are going in\" to Chicago and his claim that he is ready to deploy in Baltimore. Some will dismiss this as merely Trump's stunts to divert attention from the unstoppable Epstein inquiries. I believe Trump is testing whether he can deploy and control our military in these Democratic cities, despite laws to the contrary, for a more sinister purpose.\nDeploying armed troops on U.S. soil for domestic law enforcement invokes authoritarian tactics. It echoes the tactic of securing military power to override civil governance — an infamous step that Adolf Hitler took when the German army aligned with him. By federalizing the Metropolitan Police Department and overriding local control under Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act, the president has bypassed D.C.'s elected government.\nCentralization of control is a hallmark authoritarian approach. Declaring D.C. is in a \"crime emergency\" despite statistics showing plummeting crime rates and deploying troops primarily for a show of power, mirrors how Hitler used fabricated emergencies to legitimize crushing civil rights. This same situation is true in Portland, with reduced crime rates and no need to send in federal troops.\nThe National Guard and regular military forces were deployed in Los Angeles to assist the Immigration and Customs Enforcement forces in the apprehension of criminal immigrants. The idea was to find criminal immigrants and deport them. However, as we have seen, many innocent immigrants were swept up into this process.\nOnce Trump controls the military outside the Constitution then there is really no one left to oppose him. In theory the United States Congress can prevent this, but as they have demonstrated since Mr. Trump's inauguration, that is not happening.\nThe Supreme Court has yet to show its ultimate independence of Trump's control. Gaining the support and cooperation of the military was the final part of the plan that Adolf Hitler put into operation in his creation of the Third Reich, which eventually led to World War II. We must resist.\nThe question is what should we be doing in the face of these circumstances? I would offer these types of efforts as being very important:\nWe must stay informed and engaged. Read and listen to what is happening in the politics of our country, express our opinions and thoughts, attend meetings sponsored by our elected representatives, insist that our elected representatives have meetings.Defend our democratic institutions. Make sure you know what the Constitution says and defend those words.Demand that our government do its job and serve the people as they were elected to do.Resist rhetoric that tries to manipulate our thinking. Make sure that we do not accept the takeover of Washington, D.C. as a legitimate response to out-of-control crime that is in fact steadily decreasing. Fight the normalization of unlawful activities.Learn from history. There is too much that is happening in the current administration that mirrors things that happened in Germany in 1933. Do not ignore those signs.Vote. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Trump’s dangerous distortion of national security\n\n October 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MEL GURTOV | Section: Columns \n \n 684\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n During a large part of the post-World War II history of American foreign policy, national security meant international security — that is, defense of the U.S. homeland was believed to require a global military presence and regular interventions — political, military, economic — in the affairs of other countries.The threats changed over time from the Soviet Union to China to terrorism, but until Donald Trump, presidents never claimed that these threats required giving internal order the highest defense priority. Their policies of liberal interventionism and their commitment to an imperial presidency were directed at defeating global menaces, even at the expense of real security at home.\nNow, under Trump, we are at the start of another and far graver distortion of national security — waging \"the war from within,\" as Trump told the generals. But the enemy within isn't any enemy of past decades: the communist party, organized crime, disease or rampant inflation. It is the non-white migrant worker, the leftist intellectual, the drug trafficker, the Democratic-run city, the \"woke\" universities, liberal civil society. In short, it is most of us.\nNational security now requires widespread domestic repression: \"We have to handle it before it gets out of control,\" Trump said. He confirmed the shift to internal order when he said the National Guard would be sent to Chicago: \"We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds\" for military forces. Today's cities will play the role of U.S. military bases abroad.\n\"National security\" once again is the catchword to justify all manner of official acts that have no or very little bearing on the nation's security. Every tariff increase — on furniture, foreign movies, aluminum — is a national security measure. Border reinforcement against increasingly few illegal migrants is to bolster national security. (It's an \"invasion,\" remember.)\nRegular military units are dispatched to cities on national security missions. Pressuring law firms, universities and social media companies to conform with the administration's policy on D.E.I., and pay huge fees for compliance, is necessary for national security.\nThe Trump administration has learned from authoritarian regimes, as well as from previous administrations, that cloaking official acts in the language of national security is almost certain to get Supreme Court approval.\nTrump has essentially given up on foreign policy. He has nothing to offer beyond tariffs. He has failed to end wars in Gaza and Ukraine; in his bid for a Nobel Peace Prize, he has fully backed the genocide regime in Tel Aviv and the aggressor state in the Kremlin. And he has failed to bring China to heel; his tariff and foreign aid policies have been gifts to Beijing that have enabled it to extend its economic and political influence.\nNow, foreign policy is domestic policy: the militarization of the southern border, the attacks on presumed drug smugglers at sea. The war secretary, Pete Hegseth, may prattle about reviving a \"warrior ethos,\" but the only war he's going to conduct is in U.S. cities. Sure, there may be occasional (illegal) uses of force against Iran or the Houthis or Caribbean boats, but those are easy targets that can't retaliate against U.S. assets. Hegseth's main job is to see that Trump's ambition to quell all sources of American discontent is supported with troops.\nMany senior military officers, including Trump's chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, are reported to be upset over his plan to use the military against Americans. As well they should be: The U.S. armed forces and National Guard should never be deployed to satisfy a president's personal political agenda. Trump's plan is patently illegal, a blatant violation of the Constitution and Trump's pledge to uphold it, and a suborning of democracy.\nIt is frankly traitorous and should be denounced as such by military as well as political leaders. Surely some of our military leaders are mindful of what the militaries in other countries have done when faced with abuses of national security by corrupt, incompetent and self-interested politicians.\nUnless opposed, Trump's plan for national security can only end one way: in martial law imposed on our cities and in the mass detention of his critics. Who will rescue U.S.? \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The shutdown occurred due to a partisan argument over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, which currently covers 24 million Americans, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\nRepublicans argued that cutting ACA subsidies would help reduce the country's current budget deficit.\nThe GOP rejected the legislation that extends ACA subsidies, arguing that it could be discussed at a later time. Democrats did not budge on the issue, leading to the Government shutdown.\nActivists began marching at 9 a.m. Saturday to advocate for healthcare access \"as Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans in Congress push our country into a government shutdown rather than lower healthcare costs for families,\" according to a press release from Cambridge Indivisible.\nThe Dorchester Democratic Central Committee has been participating in the Hurlock Fall Fest Parade since 2022, and Chair of the Committee Sydney Bradner-Jacobs said around 15 people participated in the march portion of the event.\n\"We didn't really have a theme before, but with the government shutdown, I thought it was best to theme it around what's going on in Washington,\" Bradner-Jacobs said.\nCambridge Indivisible Co-founder and Co-chair Michelle Fowle said grassroots activism efforts in small towns like Hurlock and Cambridge are crucial to stand up against Republican policies she perceives will gut Medicaid and eliminate Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n\"So to keep the government open, the Republicans are saying, well, basically they're saying it without saying it, 'We want you to ensure that we strip healthcare away from millions of people, of American citizens,'\" Fowle said.\nFowle worries that if Medicaid is cut and ACA subsidies are removed, there could be hospital closures and other local impacts.\n\"I think it's important that rural communities, little tiny communities, have people getting activated,\" Fowle said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland lawmakers, union leader challenge memo threatening furloughed federal workers’ pay\n\n October 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AUDREY KEEFE Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 598\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Furloughed federal workers may not be entitled to back pay when they return from the government shutdown, according to a draft memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget, first reported by Axios.The memo comes almost a week into the shutdown and marks a stark change in the Trump administration's position on furloughed federal workers' pay.\nPresident Donald Trump further confused the issue on Tuesday. Asked by a reporter whether federal workers should get retroactive pay after the shutdown ends, the president responded: \"It depends on who we're talking about.\"\n\"For the most part, we're going to take care of our people,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we'll take care of them in a different way.\"\nHowever, Maryland lawmakers and a top union leader said the White House and the OMB are attempting to violate a 2019 law and potentially halt about 750,000 federal employees' pay.\n\"The law is the law,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said in a statement. \"That legislation was signed into law — and there is nothing this Administration can do to change that.\"\nEverett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in a statement the memo is \"an obvious misinterpretation of the law.\" The AFGE is the largest federal employee union and represents more than 820,000 workers. Kelley lambasted the memo's goals and said it is an attack on federal employees.\n\"The livelihoods of the patriotic Americans serving their country in the federal government are not bargaining chips in a political game,\" Kelley said.\n\"Those who want the government to stay open and operating do not threaten its employees,\" Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said in a post on X. \"Federal workers aren't political pawns; they're patriots.\"\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, said in a statement \"the president has no right to just pay the federal workers in his own political camp.\"\n\"The president is threatening to deliberately violate the law; or he is suffering from a debilitating case of legislative amnesia,\" Raskin said. \"Either way, he should refresh his memory on the law he signed. And if he chooses to barrel forward anyway, he should get ready for a fight in court.\"\nThe Government Employee Fair Treatment Act was signed in 2019 by President Donald Trump during the last government shutdown. The bill ensured back pay for federal employees during lapses in federal spending.\nNow, an amended version is providing OMB with an alleged loophole, stating the compensation is only mandatory \"subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse,\" the bill said.\nThe new interpretation means furloughed workers could only be paid if the funds are specifically appropriated by Congress, according to Axios. This differs from the original statement made in 2019 by OPM, which said furloughed workers would receive retroactive pay.\nEssential federal employees, such as military service members and air traffic controllers, may be the only workers entitled to pay once the government reopens, according to the White House memo.\nVan Hollen argued the interpretation shift threatens the original intent of the law. He previously worked with former Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, in 2019 to \"ensure federal employees would receive guaranteed back pay for any future shutdowns,\" he said in a statement.\nRep. Glenn Ivey, D-Maryland, said instead of \"attacking government workers,\" Republicans and the Trump administration should come to the table with Democrats and create a solution to the Medicaid cuts and expiration of the Affordable Care Act.\n\"Democrats are trying to force (Republicans) to fix the problem they've created, and that's what we're going to do,\" Ivey told Capital News Service. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

such events could take down power grids as well as communications and other technology systems essential for contemporary market economies and modern everyday life.\n\"If you don't have electricity, everything just comes to a grinding and horrible halt,\" said Munson, whose company has patents and technology applications for energy storage, agriculture, defense and other sectors.\n\"Life turns to hell right fast,\" he said.\nA BIG WORRY\nElectromagnetic pulses as well as nuclear weapons detonated in space could potentially be used to cause dangerous surges and other disruptions.\nMunson said a detonation of nuclear weapons in space by an adversary such as North Korea could send electromagnetic pulses and waves that \"could knock out the U.S.\"\nMunson also points to North Korea's construction of extensive underground facilities and tunnels to help withstand a major war.\n\"They could bury all their troops underground,\" said Munson.\nMunson said a major solar storm like the 1859 Carrington Event (where the Northern Lights could be seen in Florida) would have monumental impacts today.\n\"A big solar storm is the worry,\" he said.\nMunson points to an industrial and urbanized world dependent on power supplies, data centers, smartphones and digital and technology platforms for banking, communications, defense, health care and other sectors.\nMunson said it could take a significant amount of time to replace utility transformers and transmission infrastructure, and he noted most of that power grid equipment is manufactured overseas, including China.\n\"There's no stockpile of transformers,\" said Munson. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moments later, the Sons of the American Legion (SAL) commander found himself standing before his peers — \"dumbfounded,\" as he described it — as he was presented with the national SAL Squadron Commander of the Year award.The award was given by Maryland SAL Commander Jason Miller of Chestertown and followed by words of praise from Department Commander for the state of Maryland Nikki Randolph of Kent Island.\n\"John leads by example, and is exactly the kind of person we want representing the American Legion,\" Randolph said. She added, \"I wish every American Legion Post in Maryland was like Post 18 in Centreville,\" crediting the Post's long-standing leadership and teamwork in support of veterans.\nQueen Anne's County Commissioner Phil Dumenil also took part in the ceremony, reading a proclamation signed by all five commissioners recognizing White's dedication.\nIt read, in part:\n\"John has been a dedicated member of the SAL since 2015. He devoted countless hours each day volunteering at Post 18, supporting not only squadron activities, but the entire Post family — handling the ordering, shopping, advertising and setup for weekly Friday night dinners. He welcomes veterans each Monday morning for their Veterans Helping Veterans meetings at the Post. John is instrumental in coordinating the Mid-Shore Toys for Tots program, managing logistics across four counties, and personally ensuring that children in need receive toys, candy and letters during the annual Letters to Santa program that reaches approximately 150 local children each year.\n\"He actively participates in setup and cleanup for the annual Wreaths Across America ceremonies at two local cemeteries, honoring the memory of veterans with dignity and respect. John has contributed significantly to the growth and improvement of the Post home, assisting in fundraising and working with contractors during major renovations, ensuring the success and sustainability of Post 18. The success of Post 18 is a direct reflection of the dedication and teamwork of its members, with John White leading by example — always willing to assist anyone in a time of need, and serving as a cornerstone of the Post's continued success and strength.\"\nWhite joined the SAL in 2015, eligible through his grandfather and father, both U.S. Navy veterans. His grandfather served during World War I; his father and father-in-law were Vietnam veterans. His father-in-law, who served in the Air Force, flew 116 fighter-jet missions.\nWhite said he joined the Legion in their honor and to serve other veterans. \"I had regrets that I never served in the military,\" he said.\nOf the award, White added, \"This is a Post award, really. It's not about me. You've seen the turnout we get when our Post hosts events — we have great support from our membership. The award might have my name on it, but it's really for all of us. I don't do all these things by myself.\"\nWhite also credited past commanders of the Centreville Post \"who have led the membership to serve the community and other veterans.\"\nBefore his retirement, White served 32 years with the U.S. Department of Justice as a multimedia IT specialist. He is a graduate of DeMatha High School in Hyattsville, Md., where he played football under famed coach Morgan Wootten. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Some thoughts on a US president from Maryland\n\n October 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 736\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n To date, no individual born or living in Maryland has been elected to serve as president of the United States.Ever since Gov. Wes Moore was elected in 2022, he has been viewed by many as a rising star in the Democratic Party.\nMany of his admirers have even suggested he has potential to be the Democratic Party's 2028 candidate for president.\nThat is not surprising. Wes Moore is a charismatic, progressive and relatively young elected official at a time when both major political parties are struggling mightily with internal divides between longtime and elderly party leaders and emerging younger leaders.\nDespite that political chatter, Moore has repeatedly said he will not run for president in 2028.\nInstead, he has said he is eager and ready to run for reelection as governor for a second four-year term.\nThat said, if Wes Moore does have future national ambitions, they may ultimately be delayed or derailed by another charismatic Maryland Democratic elected official — U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen.\nVan Hollen has had a long career in politics starting with elections to serve as a Democratic member in the Maryland House of Delegates and in the Maryland Senate.\nHe was elected to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives as the Democratic representative from Maryland's 8th Congressional District.\nIn 2016, he was elected to the United States Senate, re-elected to a second term in 2022, and is now the senior U.S. senator from Maryland.\nVan Hollen has not said anything about if or when he may run for president, but his actions speak louder than silence on this matter.\nVan Hollen has regularly and aggressively challenged a wide range of decisions and actions of the second Trump administration, including but not limited to federal government spending cuts, immigration deportments and closing or relocating federal agencies.\nVan Hollen has opposed Trump administration efforts to detain and deport El Salvador native Kilmar Abrego Garcia, maintaining Garcia has been denied due process on these efforts.\nIn September, he was the keynote speaker at a Democratic Steak Fry in Polk County, Iowa.\nIowa is a longtime early testing ground on the popularity and viability of presidential candidates from both major parties.\nVan Hollen has been a guest on Yahoo News, CBS News, CNN, NBC News and The Hill.\nBetween now and the next two election cycles, a lot can happen in the Maryland and national political arenas.\nIn Maryland, Wes Moore is widely expected to win a second term next year, but in today's volatile and unpredictable political environment, that is not a given.\nNext year, Maryland's Republican voters may nominate a candidate that unites, energizes and mobilizes their base voters. Those voters combined with enough Democratic and unaffiliated voters, could result in Wes Moore losing next November. That is unlikely, but not impossible.\nIn 2014, Democratic candidate and former Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown was almost universally expected to be elected governor, but he lost in a historic upset to Larry Hogan.\nKey elements of a winning political campaign always include messaging, money and meeting expectations.\nIn his upcoming reelection effort, Wes Moore will have no problem with messaging and raising campaign contributions.\nHe may find meeting or exceeding expectations to be a challenge.\nHis rising star status could be greatly diminished if, in a deep blue state, his reelection vote margin is significantly lower than his landslide win for the governorship the first time when he received 64.5 % of votes cast.\nOne unanswered question for Wes Moore and or Chris Van Hollen is if either would agree to be nominated as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2028.\nHistorically, pursuing a nomination for the vice presidency is not something candidates publicly announce or overtly pursue. Instead, presidential nominees for both major parties announce their choice for a vice presidential running mate and their choice is ratified at their party's national convention.\nThat was the case when Richard Nixon chose Maryland's former governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate in 1968. Agnew served in that role until 1973 when he resigned in disgrace.\nServing as a vice president as a pathway to nomination and election as president has had mixed success. Only six have done so since 1948 — Harry Truman, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush and Joseph Biden.\nUltimately, only time will tell if either Wes Moore or Chris Van Hollen will be the first Marylander in history to be nominated or serve as president of the United States or be the second Marylander in history to be nominated or serve as a U.S. vice president. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Celebrating 250 years of the U.S. Navy through the history of the Washington Navy Yard\n\n October 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Alice Swan Special to The Enquirer-Gazette | Section: News \n \n 1332\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Strolling the river walk along the Washington Navy Yard waterfront today, it is hard to imagine that the Anacostia River, from the Yard all the way to its confluence with the Potomac River, was a testing area for the weapons being built here before and during the Civil War. Or that the Yard was once home to more than 20,000 workers in its weapons manufacturing facilities from World War II until the 1960s.Harder still is picturing what the area surrounding the Navy Yard would have looked like when President George Washington picked the site of what would become the U.S. Navy's largest shipbuilding and ship refitting facility in 1799, creating the Navy's oldest active shore base.\nWho knew — except for the dedicated Navy personnel and civilians who work there — the history that was hiding behind the impressive white façade of the Latrobe Gate on the Navy Yard's M Street boundary? But thanks to Kristina Higgins, Command Public Affairs Officer for the Naval History and Heritage Command and NHHC Education Specialist Michael Galloway, At Ease was provided a behind-the-gate glimpse into the legends and legacy of this important Navy installation.\nAccording to Galloway, the Navy Yard was created in 1799 for the purpose of having a government-run shipbuilding activity. The Yard was supposed to build large ships of the line — a 50 or more-gun vessel — but that didn't happen, he noted, due to the shallow depth of the East Branch of the Potomac (Anacostia River) caused by its shifting sandy bottom.\n\"Shipping vessels already had a presence in that area in the 1700s along with many docks,\" Galloway explained. \"The area had plenty of trees to supply lumber for ship building and the marshes supplied hemp for making rope. I found a map in the Library of Congress from 1792 that shows the area was pretty much entirely farmland with heavy woodland. In the book \"Round Shot to Rockets\", one of the histories of the Navy Yard, it talks about Commandant of the Navy Yard Thomas Tingey's first arrival here in January 1800, and he describes it as a wilderness.\"\nDuring its early years, the Navy Yard became the Navy's largest shipbuilding and ship-refitting facility. The History and Heritage Command notes that 22 vessels were built at the Yard, from 70-foot gun boats to the Minnesota, a 246-foot steam frigate. In 1815, Navy leaders decided to limit the role of the Yard to just shipbuilding, eventually leading to the Yard's shift in focus to ordnance and technology for the next century. By the 1850s, the Yard's primary function had evolved into ordnance production, spurred by the engineering genius Lieutenant John Dahlgren (who would also serve as the commandant of the Yard).\n\"Early Navy Yards did a little bit of everything and that comes down to infrastructure,\" Galloway shared. \"There weren't good roads in early America and there weren't railroads until the 1830s, so you had to do everything in one spot. By the mid-1800's the Navy starts to separate operations, so with John Dahlgren, the Father of Naval Ordnance, already establishing a lot of great gunnery work here with testing and development, that's when the Washington Navy Yard becomes a Naval gun factory, and then the Yard is named the U.S. Naval Gun Factory (in World War ll). And that was the Yard's purpose until the 1960s.\"\nGalloway admitted that many people are surprised to learn about the Navy Yard's history of shipbuilding and ordnance manufacturing. At the Yard's height of production, some 25,000 people were working at the Navy Yard, becoming one of the largest employers for the local community, he said. He added that in the 19th century a lot of homes were built for workers just north of the Yard and that worker neighborhoods also formed on the east and southeast sides of the Yard starting in the early 1900s.\n\"When you are in Washington, D.C., what do you think about — The Pentagon, the Capital and the city being a hub for government and policy,\" Galloway said. \"You don't think about this being a get-your-hands-dirty, blue-collar town. The Navy Yard may be one of the larger remnants of manufacturing that took place in this area. There were 188 buildings, on 26 acres making some of the most dangerous and advanced weapons materials in the world by the end of World War II.\"\nHiggins noted that visitors to the Yard are also amazed by the Optical Tower, a reminder of the Yard's scientific and manufacturing history.\n\"Just the practicality of putting the tower in the middle of D.C. and using the monuments and buildings of the city to calibrate weapon sights that were manufactured here,\" she explained.\nFrom the tower, which was built in 1918, sightings were taken on the United States Capitol, the Washington Monument and the Masonic Temple in Alexandria, 10 miles away.\nGalloway added that the Anacostia River really was a testing area for the weapons being built at the Yard until the creation of longer-range guns. He said that the Naval test batteries were a big deal for the local community. People would come out to the riverbanks with picnics and watch the guns fire, staying safely out of range.\n\"President Abraham Lincoln was a frequent visitor to the Navy Yard during the Civil War, and loved to talk with Dahlgren about weapon development,\" Galloway shared. \"In a tragic twist, his assassins are also associated with the Yard. John Wilkes Booth escaped across the early Navy Yard Bridge, and his body was brought to the USS Montauk at the Navy Yard for a postmortem examination. Some of his co-conspirators were held in the copper rolling building before their trial at Fort McNair.\"\nThe Yard also was the arrival point in D.C. for many distinguished visitors through the early history of the nation. As Galloway explained, \"Before transatlantic flights become routine — where are you going to have visiting dignitaries arrive? They would land by boat at the Navy Yard, including Japan's first embassy personnel in 1860.\"\nAnother famous moment for the Navy Yard was the arrival of the USS Olympia, carrying the remains of the United States' World War I Unknown Soldier, docking at the Yard on Nov. 9, 1921, he noted.\nAs the U.S. Navy marks its 250th birthday on Oct. 13, the Navy's oldest shore establishment still has a critical role to play for the force, Higgins explained.\n\"While its history is unparalleled, the Yard's modern strategic importance stems directly from the concentration of vital commands headquartered on its grounds: the Chief of Naval Operations, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Navy Installations Command (CNIC), Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC), Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command (NAVFAC), and Strategic Systems Programs (SSP). The Yard is the administrative and operational heart of the fleet,\" she said.\nLooking into the future, the Navy Yard will also be a part of the continuing beautification and development of the surrounding community, Higgins added.\n\"One of the things we are really excited about at Naval History and Heritage Command is that the Navy Yard is going to be a part of that growth through the construction of the new National Museum of the U.S. Navy,\" she said. \"The museum is going to be built in an unused field just off the Navy Yard. I don't know if that would have been possible if not for the expansion of the Nat's Park and the Navy Yard area over the last 20 years. The Navy wanted to keep the museum in D.C.; they wanted it to be walkable, have Metro access and the current growth of the local area made it an easy choice to put the new museum next to the Navy Yard.\"\nThough the current museum is closed, it still hosts special events, including for the Navy's 250th anniversary. Galloway said that interested individuals can visit the 250th events tab on the Museum's website — www.history.navy.mil/content/history/museums/nmusn/navy250.html — to see all the planned activities, locally and at other Navy installations near Washington.\nThe above URL may not display correctly for all users.\nTo read more, visit dcmilitary.com/at_ease. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) visited Talbot County Democrats in Easton on Sunday, taking aim at President Donald Trump and the Republican Party.In a nearly 40-minute keynote speech during the Talbot County Democratic Forum's annual Kennedy-King Unity Dinner, Raskin went on energetic runs to engage the crowd, alternating between current issues such as immigration enforcement and Trump's ongoing battles with federal courts since taking office.\nLocal officials, including Talbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher, attended.\nRaskin, who represents residents in Montgomery and Prince George's counties, hosted a town hall in Cambridge in March. He said he enjoys trips to the Eastern Shore, especially since he went to summer camp in Worton as a child.\n\"I come because I know you're the only Marylanders who don't have a Democratic member of Congress,\" Raskin told a packed crowd inside of Temple B'nai Israel on Sunday.\nRep. Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) is the representative for Eastern Shore residents.\nRaskin also used the speech to tout some of his optimistic and broad opinions, such as granting Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico statehood and abolishing the electoral college — a system he called \"an accident waiting to happen every four years.\"\nRaskin criticized Trump for imposing tariffs in a manner that the congressman said exceeds presidential power. He said Trump's actions are being rejected in district and appeals courts around the nation.\n\"The rule of law is holding, Donald Trump is losing until we get to just one court,\" Raskin said. \"There's one court that has been packed and stacked and sliced and diced and gerrymandered to his advantage and to his liking, which is the Supreme Court.\"\nAfter delivering the speech and accommodating a long line of local Democrats hoping to chat or take photos, Raskin weighed in on the ongoing government shutdown in an interview.\nHe said an agreement needs to be reached where people are not losing health care tax credits — the central issue driving the Senate's deadlock on an appropriations bill.\n\"I hope that our Republican colleagues will recognize that and come back to Washington and make a deal,\" Raskin said. \"But right now it's just Democrats in Congress waiting for the Republicans to come back home to D.C.\"\nMaryland Republicans in Congress have placed blame on Democrats, criticizing them for not OK'ing a continuing resolution to fund the government through Nov. 21. Harris said earlier this month that Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks, both Democrats, are part of the problem.\n\"Because so many Marylanders are federal employees, I think that the two senators should realize that will harm a lot of Marylanders,\" Harris said.\nTALK OF 2026\nSunday evening inside Temple B'nai Israel, early discussions on 2026 election strategy were held. Justin Butler, director of party affairs for the Maryland Democratic Party and a member of the Talbot County Democratic Central Committee, said the party needs to \"get back to voters\" and listen.\n\"Here in Maryland, we can't be out of touch,\" Butler said.\nRaskin said the biggest challenge facing Democrats is the national redistricting fight. Republicans have led pushes to redraw maps in states such as Texas and Florida, while Democrats have countered in California and New York.\n\"They have proven themselves to be focused like a laser beam on gerrymandering us into oblivion,\" Raskin said. \"We have to fight back at the state level wherever we can, and then we have to mobilize a huge popular movement to oppose that assault on democracy.\"\nIn Maryland, a state senator filed a bill to redraw the eight congressional districts— a proposal that would edit Harris' 1st District to remove Harford and Cecil counties and add part of Anne Arundel. Harris has said the proposal will lose in court, and \"perhaps the courts will redraw a nonpartisan map\" to flip seats for Republicans.\nLocally, Butler told the crowd Sunday that a priority for Democrats going into 2026 should be winning more seats on the Talbot County Council. Currently, Lesher and Keasha Haythe are two Democrats to three Republicans on the body.\n\"We have a chance, next year, to fix that,\" Butler said. \"To make sure that we have a majority on the County Council that's gonna be able to implement tolerance, compassion, unity and truly work for all citizens of Talbot County.\"\nThis story has been updated. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Green Party defines success in political arena\n\n October 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 746\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Vince Lombardi, legendary head coach of the National Football League's Green Bay Packers, often said, \"Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing.\"The leadership of the Green Party in Maryland does not embrace that philosophy, at least when it applies to winning an election.\nEarlier this month, Andy Ellis filed paperwork with the Maryland State Board of Elections, to be the Green Party candidate in the 2026 general election for governor of Maryland. He also filed paperwork for Owen Andrews to be his running mate as the Green Party candidate for lieutenant governor.\nAccording to his campaign biography, Ellis has served as a Green Party organizer and former Green Party nominee for the Maryland House of Delegates. He previously served as co-chair of both the Baltimore City and Maryland Green Parties and has held national roles on the Green Party's Presidential Campaign Support Committee, Ballot Access Committee and Coordinated Campaign Committee.\nHe is the founder of Debate Strategies LLC, a consulting firm focused on public debate, civic engagement and political augmentation.\nEllis is realistic about his odds of winning.\nHe has said candidly, \"I would love it if we were the next governor and lieutenant governor. But I am a student of history and political science. ... We're not going to go and set expectations that we don't think we can meet.\"\nAs a self-described student of history and political science, Ellis is likely aware that Maryland voters have only elected two third-party candidates for governor.\nThey are Thomas Hicks, the American Party candidate in 1858 and Augustus Bradford, the Union Party candidate in 1882.\nWith regard to setting campaign expectations, Ellis has three key campaign goals.\nThe first goal is to take necessary steps for their campaign to qualify for and receive public campaign financing from Maryland's Fair Campaign Financing Act.\nThat was a fundraising strategy that Larry Hogan used when he requested and received public funds in his first run for governor.\nWith a goal of $120,000 in contributions from 1,500 Marylanders (capped at $250 each), the Green Party of Maryland could get a state-funded match of the contributions received from other sources.\nEllis and Andrews have already started fundraising with a campaign launch party that met a goal of $2,026.\nGoal 2 is to secure an invitation to participate in gubernatorial debates including, but not limited to, the debate sponsored by Maryland Public Television.\nAndrews has said, \"We think that if Marylanders are able to see and hear us, and see and hear our positions, then we're more likely to achieve that top-line goal.\"\nThe third goal is for the Green Party candidates to receive at least 4% of the total votes cast in the November 2026 gubernatorial general election.\nIf they do that, they will eclipse the best showing by a third-party gubernatorial candidate in Maryland since 1895 when the Prohibition Party candidate received 3.2% of the votes cast.\nMore importantly, meeting or exceeding that goal will maintain their status as a political party that will automatically be included on future Maryland general election ballots.\nThis goal is immensely important for the future viability for the Green Party and also for other third parties in Maryland.\nEvery time the Green Party and other third parties in Maryland fail to get 4% of the votes in statewide general elections, party volunteers have to collect 10,000 signatures from registered voters for their candidates' names to be included on future general election ballots.\nThat signature collection process requires an inordinate amount of volunteer time and effort.\nThat time and effort could be reallocated to inform, energize and mobilize Maryland voters who may be ready and willing to consider supporting the Green Party's core values and their positions on such issues economic matters, housing affordability and increasing energy costs.\nThis has significant potential at a time when polling results are showing increasing voter disenchantment with the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.\nThe bottom line is, the Maryland Green Party is well positioned going into Maryland's 2026 gubernatorial general election.\nThat is not because their candidates have any chance of winning that election.\nThey do have an opportunity to demonstrate to candidates of both major parties that the Green Party's core values and issue positions resonate with at least 4% of the voters.\nThat is meaningful, as Larry Hogan received 51.0% of the vote in his first run for governor and Anthony Brown received 47.2% of the vote, a difference of 3.8%.\nIt would also affirm that any third political party with realistic expectations, measurable goals and effective campaign execution can achieve success in the political arena in Maryland without winning an election. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I trust your recess was restful. Unfortunately, it was also silent. You chose not to hold a town hall meeting during your time in the district. That absence did not go unnoticed. It deprived your constituents of the chance to hear you explain why you reversed yourself on the spending bill you had so fiercely opposed — until you suddenly didn't. You claimed \"assurances\" persuaded you. Assurances of what, exactly? Your vote helped push through the single largest increase in the federal deficit in history. If you stand by that decision, you should have had the courage to face us and defend it.But my main concern today is not the budget, it is the Jeffrey Epstein files. You are a Catholic. You are a father of daughters. Given both, it should not require any moral calculus to condemn not only Epstein, but also anyone who willingly associated with him while he and his circle exploited, abused, and demeaned young women. The conduct in question — sexual assault, abuse of minors, harassment in dressing rooms, grotesque violations of trust — is abhorrent. And participation in, or willful blindness to, these acts is unforgivable.\nYour colleagues in Congress are circulating a bipartisan discharge petition demanding the release of all Epstein files. This is a defining moment for you. Will you align yourself with justice and transparency, or will you shield predators and the powerful? As a father, you owe this to every parent whose child was harmed. As a man of faith, you owe it to your conscience. As my representative, you owe it to me.\nSo let me be clear: I expect you to sign this petition. I demand that you sign it. Your record of retreat and equivocation has already earned you the nickname \"nowhere man.\" If you fail to step up here, it will confirm that title — and worse, it will mark you as someone who turned away from the helpless in their moment of need.\nThe victims deserve closure. The public deserves the truth. The perpetrators deserve justice. Representative Harris, history will remember whether you stood tall or disappeared. Choose wisely.\nDAN McKEW\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Local No Kings rallies among thousands nationwide\n\n October 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CHRISTINE CONDON and DANIELLE J. BROWN Maryland Matter | Section: Local News \n \n 1248\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In Queen Anne's County, where 62% of voters went for President Donald Trump in last year's election, some of the people who showed up for the No Kings rally said they were pleasantly surprised by Saturday's turnout.Several hundred people attended, many waving hand-drawn signs by the roadside in Centreville's small historic downtown, while others gathered in the courtyard, where a musician performed at a piano, and organizers opened the mic for testimonials.\n\"The honks and waves way outnumber the middle fingers,\" said Tom Gallagher, 74, of the public response to No Kings in Centreville. The Anne Arundel County resident crossed the Bay Bridge to attend the rally here.\nNo Kings protests dotted Maryland's rural and conservative Eastern Shore, running up U.S. Route 50 from Ocean City and Salisbury to Cambridge and Easton, where protesters lined the busy highway beside a Wawa convenience store, attracting a smattering of honks as cars drove past. A single counterprotester stood in the grass behind them, yelling \"We love President Trump.\" But he was handily outnumbered, as the assembled group chanted: \"Love, not hate, makes America great.\"\nBeverly Fox, 75, an Easton resident who is disabled, uses a motorized wheelchair to get around. On Saturday, the back of her wheelchair sported an image of Trump wearing a crown with the message \"No Kings.\"\n\"That man has got to go,\" said Fox, who worries about Trump's attacks on health insurance for vulnerable Americans. \"Every day I think I can't get shocked any more.\"\nIn Talbot County, Trump's victory was far narrower than elsewhere on the Eastern Shore, winning 11,125 votes to 11,119 for Vice President Kamala Harris.\nFor many attendees on Saturday, it felt difficult to choose just one reason they were drawn to decorate handmade signs and wave them by the roadside.\n\"I don't even know where to start,\" said Ashley Cromwell, a Queenstown resident who came to Centreville with a \"We the People\" sign.\n\"Since Trump first — in 2015 — came on the scene this way, I've been against what he stands for, and the hatred and the anger and the division and the way that he wants to take power for himself,\" Cromwell said.\nEven if it was sometimes hard to articulate, attendees on Saturday were united by a passion to speak up against Trump.\nAcross the Bay in Baltimore — where 12.8% of voters backed Trump in 2024 — the challenge was not getting people to turn out, but managing No Kings on the same day as the 25th annual Baltimore Running Festival, when an estimated 10,000 runners were expected to take over downtown to compete in everything from a 5K to a full marathon.\nMost coped by combining the two events, with runners wearing No Kings gear and No Kings attendees lining the race route with signs playing off the combination of the two events, like the one that said, \"You're running better than the government.\"\nThe Baltimore and Centreville rallies were just two of more than 60 events scheduled in Maryland Saturday, from Ocean City to LaVale and from Northeast to Lexington Park and scores of points in between.\nThey were in big cities like Baltimore and small towns like Centreville. They were in deep blue counties like Montgomery, which had more than a dozen events scheduled, to deep red counties like Carroll, where one event was scheduled for the County Government Building in Westminster for those willing to brave it.\nNationwide, more than 2,600 events were planned, in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam and the District of Columbia, where as many as 100,000 were expected to turn out. Events were being held overseas as well, in Australia and across Europe — although events in the United Kingdom were tactfully labeled \"No Tyrants\" events.\nSome estimates said turnout for the weekend's events could be in the millions.\nThe latest rallies are a followup to No Kings events in June that were held to counter President Donald Trump's massive military parade in Washington to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Army — and, some say not coincidentally, Trump's 79th birthday.\nThere were about 2,000 events in June. Organizers said they scheduled this weekend's events because Trump \"has doubled down\" since the first rallies, ramping up immigration raids, deploying troops to Democratic cities and urging the Justice Department to prosecute his enemies.\nA main theme of the events, besides no kings, is peaceful protest. Rallygoers were told to leave weapons at home and were trained in de-escalation techniques. And in Maryland, at least, it seemed to be working.\n'What was your tipping point?'\nStanding in the courtyard in front of the Queen Anne's County historic courthouse in Centreville, a bulletin board asked locals: \"What was your tipping point?\"\nNo more context was needed.\n\"The day he was elected — the first time,\" read one sticky note. \"Musk + DOGE,\" read another. \"The Apprentice,\" one attendee wrote.\n\"We wanted to know, what was that moment that you felt like you needed to come?\" said Elaine McNeil, chair of the Queen Anne's Democratic Central Committee, which organized Saturday's event. \"Because that's the feedback that we need to get other people to that tipping point to start standing up.\"\nGallagher, the Anne Arundel County resident who traveled to Centreville for the rally, said he has been disturbed by the administration's decision to attack ships off the coast of Venezuela, killing several people.\n\"Even if he's correct that they're drug dealers, that's still a legal matter, not a military matter,\" said Gallagher, a retired Navy veteran. \"You're being judge, jury and executioner for people out on boats in the water. It's beyond the pale.\"\nDiana Leonard, a Queen Anne's resident, said she began attending anti-Trump protests for the first time in March.\n\"I'm out here for the people that can't be out here,\" said Diana Leonard, a Queen Anne's County resident. \"Because there are people that are either disabled or they're afraid, or they've been fighting forever.\"\nBut, like many at the rallies, she was keeping it light. Leonard wore an inflatable otter costume Saturday and carried a sign that said, \"You otter join us!\" adding that she was aiming for a \"positive, unifying\" message.\nLaurie Rome, 63, said that while the Baltimore No Kings rally was a little more spread out than other protests, it was still important to show up, \"no matter the format.\"\n\"It's kind of nice to have it sort of pervasive along the route. Not just people clustered in one place,\" she said. \"There are people everywhere who think that the current level of unkindness, instability and hatred is not OK.\"\nProtesters lining the roads — and the marathon routes — seemed to be popular venues. In Prince George's County, sporadic clumps of protesters lined U.S. Route 1 from the Washington, D.C., line to the University of Maryland, College Park, and beyond.\nOn the Eastern Shore, Denise Perdue of Grasonville stood on the side of the road and talked about her \"tipping point\" while waving a sign. For Perdue, it was Nov. 5, 2024, when Trump was elected a second time.\n\"I didn't think that there was so much hate in the United States as there is, and so much bigotry,\" she said, adding that she felt that the electorate scorned Harris, the Democratic nominee, because she is a woman of color.\nAs Perdue held a sign inviting passersby to \"Honk for Humanity,\" one driver in a pickup truck flew past and yelled, \"Sore losers!\"\nPerdue was quick to respond: \"Jesus loves you!\" she shouted back. It was the same response she'd used all day for the occasional heckler passing through.\n\"Because, what are you going to say to that?\" she joked. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The national No Kings movement began in 2024 to emphasize democracy over authoritarianism and has since inspired rallies nationwide calling for transparency, equality and civic engagement.\nUnder sunny skies, the crowd filled the courthouse lawn waving homemade signs reading \"We the People\" and \"Democracy Is Not a Spectator Sport.\" Throughout the afternoon, rally goers created signs, shared personal stories about what democracy means to them and wore paperclips as symbols of solidarity and unity.\nGathering people from all walks of life, many participants were no strangers to protest, recalling the Vietnam era, the women's rights movement and the Civil Rights movement. They said the freedoms they stood for in their youth are being challenged again by this generation.\nVickie Love, of Chester, has been peacefully protesting since Vietnam and said she was disappointed in what she considered the country going backward with too much misinformation spreading.\nInspired by a recent Portland protest in which a demonstrator \"held fast in the face of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\" while dressed in a frog costume, Kelley Barrow of Kent Island hopped in solidarity with protesters on the other side of the country as an eye-catching amphibian, joined by her son Jordan, who dressed as a bear.\n\"We are not terrorists, we are peacefully protesting,\" Kelley said.\n\"It's important to show you care about this country and speak out when you can,\" Jordan said.\nThe event was not limited to Queen Anne's County residents. Coming from Annapolis to participate, Janet Gambarani, Jill Garrity and Anne Schellie voiced concern for a world being \"destroyed\" that their grandchildren will have to inherit.\nVoicing a need to persevere and promote values outlined in the Constitution, Garrity said she was particularly offended by officials who framed No Kings Day rallies as \"hate America rallies.\"\nA teacher for 30 years, committee chair Elaine McNeil noted the importance of education and said No Kings Day rallies across the country highlight the need for change and demonstrate that people will not stand for violations of their rights or the rights of others.\n\"People should feel safe in the country they pay taxes and work in,\" she said.\nAs the crowd dispersed from the Historic Courthouse Square, MacKenzie said she felt hopeful seeing generations standing together.\n\"That's what democracy looks like,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
