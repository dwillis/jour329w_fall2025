Dr.Gieske was born October 3rd, 1938 in Baltimore to Mr. Edward T. and Mary Clare Chapman Gieske. He attended Calvert School, Gilman School, Princeton University ('61), and Johns Hopkins Medical School ('65). At Hopkins, he met and married fellow student, Judith Porter, beginning an exemplary 59-year marriage.Jim then trained in Boston in general, pediatric, thoracic, and cardiac surgery. In 1967, he began Naval Service in Norfolk and served as a Medical Officer aboard USS Georgetown during the Vietnam War. In 1973, he and Judi moved to Easton where he opened a surgical practice while Judi practiced pediatrics, and they raised three sons.Jim's breadth of training enabled him to meet the surgical needs of a wide variety of patients and he practiced with the spirit of a country doctor in Easton's small community. Those who worked with him in the operating room remember him as skilled, poised, caring, and amusing.He co-founded Delmarva Foundation for Medical Care, which is now Qlarant, and chaired the Medical Ethics Committee at Memorial Hospital. In retirement, he served on the board of Talbot Hospice and remained a resource for friends, family, and anyone who came his way in need of comfort and medical guidance. He also trained doctors in Kazakhstan and helped modernize medical care in Vietnam.Settling on the Eastern Shore in 1973 was a return home, as Jim was preceded by four generations of Chapmans in Chestertown and, as a boy, he learned to sail on the Chester River. An avid sailor, Jim raced locally and offshore before he and Judi, in 1992, realized a dream which he had nurtured for decades: to sail into blue water over the horizon. Their thirst for adventure not fully quenched by a two year trip around the Caribbean, they then spent many summers traveling the canals of France by barge, embarked on several voyages to the Arctic and Antarctic, and recently traveled to the Galapagos.Dr. James Gieske rests now in peace, a man whose generosity of spirit, passion for adventure, and quest for learning never waned. He is survived by his wife, Dr. Judith Gieske, sons Chapman, Porter (Sarah), and Hardy (Vanessa), and grandchildren Sebastian, Chloe, Dash, and Juniper. Memorial donations can be made to Mid-Shore Community Foundation, designated to ITCH, an Introduction To Careers in Healthcare serving public middle schools, Jim and Judi's most recent endeavor begun only three months ago. Honor Dr. Gieske's life and extend well wishes to his family at Third Haven Meetinghouse at 405 S Washington St in Easton on Wednesday, August 23rd from 12-3pm. Burial services will be private. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Maryanne was a beloved friend, sister, aunt, devoted mother, grandmother, and loving spouse.Born in Amityville, NY on January 31, 1957 to Hugh and Marilyn Burr, Maryanne grew up on Long Island as the fifth of six children. Maryanne spent her high school years at North Babylon where she ran track and field, played trumpet and worked at Carvel Ice Cream.After graduation, Maryanne left New York to attend the University of Maryland, College Park where she met her future husband during her time as first trumpet in the \"Mighty Sound of Maryland\" Marching Band. They married in 1977 and built their home in the community of Hurlock, MD where they would raise three children and create countless memories for the next 45 years.Maryanne worked for University of Maryland Shore Regional Health for 40 years as a physical therapy aide, rotating between outpatient centers and Easton Hospital. She was known for her compassion, patience, respect, and for always greeting others with a smile and open ear.She loved people and people loved her.A member of Unity Washington United Methodist Church in Hurlock from the year they moved, Maryanne was an active member of the congregation and served on the Deborah Circle. Religion was a pillar in her life and she built lifelong friendships from the community found there. Maryanne invested deeply in her relationships and the return on her love manifested itself tenfold in the care and kindness she and her family have been afforded in the last few weeks.As a mother, Maryanne dedicated her life to her children. It's easy for families to get distracted as children grow, but she made it her mission to be the magnet to hold things together. She supported all of their ambitions, was prepared to catch them anytime they fell, and was ready with a call, an ear, and open arms whenever they were needed and even when they weren't.She loved her grandchildren. She matched their energy until the end and knew all of their interests and loves, catering all of her homemade cards for holidays and birthdays to be specifically personalized and cherished forever.She attended any event or game she could and turned her yard into a haven of ziplines, swings, ninjalines and games. She was revered.Maryanne loved her husband, Michael, and while she was most at peace in her gardens at home, they spent the last number of years traveling around the United States driving Route 1 in California, hiking the Grand Canyon at sunset, relaxing in Florida and visiting family all over. The two built a beautiful life on Palmers Mill.The loss of Maryanne leaves a deep hole in our family. She is survived by her mother, Marilyn Burr (Hugh, deceased); husband Michael, son Cory (Lisa), daughter Amanda, son Alex (Megan); grandchildren Livvie, Carter, Ellie, Kinsley, Douglas, Dean, and Annie; siblings Bruce (Terry), Glen, Andy, Ian, Kenny (Cheryl), and several incredible nephews and nieces.Maryanne was a light, she was loved immensely, and she leaves a deep legacy for her family and friends. She beat the odds and courageously battled stage four breast cancer for the last six years. While she fought quietly, she was and has always been surrounded by a group of women who carried her through.A celebration of life will be held at Unity Washington United Methodist Church in Hurlock on Saturday, August 19, 2023 at 3pm. Those who wish to visit are welcomed to join the family at 2pm.In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to the Blessings Bags initiative, something Maryanne respected and admired. To date, over 6,500 care packages have been delivered to patients undergoing cancer treatment. Checks can be mailed to: Liz Tyler, 3750 Elliott Island Road, Vienna MD 21869. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Jim Gieske led a life of medicine, adventure and family\n\n August 17, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom Mccall; tmccall@chespub.com | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 1490\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Dr. James Chapman Gieske died of cardiac arrest on Aug. 10, 2023, at University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton, formerly known as Memorial Hospital, a place where he cared for many patients over the years. He was 84.Gieske was a lover of medicine, sailing adventures, orchids and family. A Princeton and Johns Hopkins trained surgeon he gave up the glitz of a skyrocketing career and settled on the Eastern Shore to raise a family and care for his patients.Often patients would barter with him for the ducks they had shot to get a surgery performed. This was long before health insurance took over the art of medicine.So, he said yes to ducks, crabs and even crates of lobster.At heart, he was a country doctor.His son Hardy remarked on how challenging it was as a young family man with two kids.\"Jim was in the Navy and sent off on a spy ship for seven months and couldn't tell his wife where he was going. He told mom, 'Don't know where I am going and don't know when I will be back.' He missed (brother) Porter's birth and was gone from September 1968 through Porter's second birthday. His kids were little, and I think that experience really told him to cool down. Be a dad. So, he went from being a really highly trained general pediatric thoracic cardiac surgeon. He was going to be a big wig.That experience made him want to chill and become a small country doctor. He thought, 'I want to bring my expertise to who ever comes through the door.' He probably charged 0% to 25% of his patients. We had a freezer in the garage that would be full of soft shell crabs, oysters and chickens and hams,\" Hardy said.Gieske started an insurance company out of dissatisfaction.It was the Delmarva Foundation for Medical Care. With a few other doctors he created what is now the data analysis behemoth Qlarant.\"He could feel the momentum of the business of medicine becoming too important. He was trying to keep it at bay and keep things ethical,\" Hardy said.Gieske's wife of 59 years Judi said, \"Jim always said, 'I am for the people.'\" On the home front, this introvert turned to the pursuit of keeping orchids alive in a greenhouse. To discover how he got to these sublime and notoriously difficult to cultivate flowers, one has to start at the Aspen Institute in Wye Mills.Judi said, \"We became part of a group that would work there and have dinner with this distinguished man Arthur Houghton.They wanted us on Thursday night before Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Because if the Ambassador to France or Germany or Kissinger or a Supreme Court Justice was there for a private meeting at the Aspen Institute, they wanted token locals to not talk about anything else on Thursday night. Often I would sit next to the owner.He gave the place away and he had to give his greenhouse away. He did not want to give it to the state, so he said to Jimmy, 'I understand you love orchids.' That is when we put the greenhouse in. We inherited 50 orchids.\" Jim Gieske led two lives as both a country mouse and a city mouse. He was just as home with watermen as he was Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, banker and philanthropist Frank and Trisha Saul and former National Gallery Director Rusty and Nancy Powell.He enjoyed many New Year's dinners with this group.He was remembered in an Annapolis courtroom last week before court got started.\"Before we get started with the cases I want to take a moment to publicly acknowledge Jim Gieske.He was a doctor, who near as I can tell operated on just about everyone I have met this side of Easton. One time I was looking for his home in a rural area. So I stopped and asked a bunch of farmers if they knew how to find Dr.Gieske's home and instead of just giving me direction each farmer would pull up his shirt and show me some scar or manifestation where Dr. Gieske had helped them out at one point. Thank you, Dr. Gieske,\" said Hon. Mark Crooks, Fifth Judicial Circuit Associate Judge of Anne Arundel County.Like all men there is the public self and the private.\"In public, he was a formal guy and liked to have intellectual conversations; the other side of him always like to have his hands in the dirt. There was a very casual organic unfettered simplicity to him. Gardening and sailing and medicine and all these collisions of the deeply intellectual study of something like music and just being in real life,\" Hardy said.He had a long standing movie night date with lawyer JT Smith. They did not watch rom coms and instead went for a thoughtful diet of Bergman, Hitchcock and Kurosawa. Smith would make the salad, and Gieske would bring the burgers.Once a month for 15 years the tradition held. Often times discussions would turn political, but Smith recalled Gieske being very persuasive and thoughtful even in his contrarian opposition.Gieske also loved to listen to classical music and later in life took up the ukalele. He was not great, but he taught himself the opening of Bach's Cello Suite on the ukalele.He would study different versions of a single composition.He was also an adventurer.During the Newport to Bermuda race his sail boat filled up with water and needed rescuing.\"I believe it was 1978 or 1979 that he was in the Bermuda races and their boat capsized in the middle of the Atlantic. Dr. Thompson was on the boat as well as Chuck Benson. That was something he often smiled about.They were rescued by the Coast Guard,\" said Dr. Stan Bysshe Jr., a general surgeon.John Knud-Hanson, Gieske and Bysshe were in practice together for over 20 years.They had matching vanity plates KGB 1 and KGB 2 and KGB 3. This was a time before cell phones. All they had were beepers and occasionally a state trooper would come get a surgeon needed, who was out of touch.\"He was extremely gifted with his hands as a surgeon.And you know that whole Dutchman's Lane complex was nothing until we put up the first medical building there and then the second.And then it all blossomed. It all started with 505 Dutchman's Lane. Medicine today is a job, and when we practiced it was a passion. Today it is about how much time do you get off. When Jim and John and I practiced it was medicine and if we were lucky we slotted in family life where we could. What Jim and Judi did was remarkable.To have two active practices and raise three great sons,\" Bysshe said.Years later Gieske bought a live aboard barge and navigated the Seine in France for 10 summers. He also took off to sail around the Caribbean for two years saying, \"We don't know where we are going and we are going for and indefinite amount of time. Are you up for it?\" He took his wife and his son Hardy. Hardy taught his mom how to sail on the way.Even after his two year sailing hiatus with his wife, Gieske never practiced in a hospital again, but he gave hundreds of consultations in his living room. Or he would travel as a physician to remote places like Kazakhstan with Doctors Without Borders, or to Vietnam. In later years, Gieske discovered that if he offered himself up as the adventurous doctor, the doors of access swung open. He served as a doctor in China, Antarctica, the Arctic, Kazakhstan, Vietnam and the Galapagos. He even found himself aboard a Russian fishing vessel.Judi said, \"We had very vigorous medical careers. With retirement, we thought we were looking forward to something with some action.\" On the Joli Coeur (Pretty Heart), they traveled around 5,000 miles in France by barge. There was no shortage of vineyards, fresh bread and gooey cheese to experience aboard the 78-foot pleasure craft. They fell in love with France.Even his last week seemed charmed. He took a trip to Martha's Vineyard and was surrounded his family and grandchildren.The community is invited to honor Gieske's life and extend well wishes to his family from noon to 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 23, at Third Haven Meetinghouse, 405 S. Washington St., Easton. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nDr. James Gieske led a life filled with surgery, boats, orchids and family.\n \nCONTRIBUTED\n \nA 78-foot barge named Joli Coeur (Pretty Heart) was home for Jim and Judi Gieske for many summers. Both doctors, Judi said that they were active in their medical careers, so why not have an active retirement. They fell in the love with the people and food of France and traveled around 5,000 miles.\n \nCONTRIBUTED\n \nAfter graduating from Princeton, Jim Gieske joined the Navy. He was assigned to a spy boat during Vietnam and didn't see his two young children for nearly two years. He had many adventures on boats over the years including sinking a racing sailboat during the Newport to Bermuda race. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Her family is deeply saddened by her sudden loss.Born on April 1, 1954, in urban Baltimore, her family moved to the scenic town of Cambridge, MD in 1962 and were captivated by the beauty of the Choptank River. Sandy attended Cambridge High School and soon after married and later happily divorced Lyle Cameron Sr., remaining amicable. She often joked that her three children were that union's greatest gift. Displaced from homemaking, like many women of her time she persevered, working at Black and Decker, Airpax, and in the hospitality industry. She also married a second time; she made it clear that his name does not merit mention in her story.Sandy was strong-willed, but also possessed immense empathy-traits that helped her though life's many challenges. She approached life with a caring and loyal spirit, leaving lasting impressions on those fortunate enough to cross her path. She loved the beach, vacations and time spent with her children and grandkids. Among her treasured memories were her childhood days spent fishing outside the Cambridge Yacht Club where her love for the water was born, and her final wish was to return to those beloved waters.In her moments of relaxation, Sandy found solace in the pages of books, immersing herself in different worlds. True crime TV shows were a guilty pleasure, and she cherished the weekends spent with her family and friends. Sandy's heart overflowed with love not only for people but also for animals. Her furry companions, both canine and feline, held a special place within her and she was as passionate about helping animals in need as she was people.Sandy is survived by her children, Donise Cameron Dukes (Greg Dukes), Sherry Cameron Adibi (Clyde Adibi), and Lyle Lewis Cameron Jr. (Dayniese Hurley) Her grandchildren, Serena Grace Bloodsworth, Violet Grace Dukes, Iris June Dukes, Joseph Koby Cameron, Scotlund Bayne Cameron, Sebastian Willey, and great-grandson Elijah Willey. She is also survived by her sisters, BJ Brown, Marion Badger, Peggy Andrews, and her brothers, John Badger and Levin Badger.A celebration of Sandy's life is planned for the 30th of September at the Cambridge Yacht Club at 1 Mill Street in Cambridge, MD, from 12 pm to 3 pm. At half past noon, a memorial service will commence. Fellowship and libations shall follow thereafter. Interment will be private.In lieu of floral arrangements, contributions may also be made to the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in tribute to Sandy's compassionate and selfless nature. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He served on the MidShore Regional Council from 2003 to 2010 and the Caroline County Planning Commission from 2007 to 2010. He was past chair of the county Board of Estimates.The county flag was flown at half-staff in Layton's memory.\"I can't tell you how many conversations we had about things, and he would give me his perspective on issues,\" Porter said. \"He was a very, very good source of information and advice, and his advice was always very good.\"Although he didn't know Layton well, Commission President Travis Breeding said he appreciated Layton's backing in the 2022 election.\"He was a supporter of mine and made sure he reached out to me and wanted a sign to put up,\" he said. \"I heard nothing but good things about him, and obviously I have a newfound respect for his public service and the amount of time and dedication\" he devoted, especially during a \"second round of public service that he did as a commissioner.\"According to Layton's obituary, \"Roger's sense of duty and commitment to public service led him to the Maryland State Police Academy, where he graduated in March 1975.\"He was a Maryland State trooper until his retirement in 1997 and served at barracks in Centreville, Denton, Easton, Annapolis and Salisbury.From 1997 to 2002, Layton was an investigator for the Caroline County State's Attorney Office.Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker met Layton when Layton was still a state trooper. They went on to become friends and neighbors.\"Roger was absolutely a great guy,\" Baker said. \"He was a great friend and a great mentor to me, and he will be deeply missed.\"Born Aug. 5, 1953, in Baltimore, Layton was the son of the late Robert Cosden and the late Reva Pauline Sard. He graduated in 1972 from Easton High School.\"He played a pivotal role in shaping the future of his county,\" his obituary stated. \"His dedication to his community was a testament to his love for Denton and the surrounding areas.\"Layton was known for his love of the outdoors, finding \"solace and joy in hunting, fishing, and (excelling) in the art of trap shooting,\" his obituary stated.\"He was an avid fisherman and hunter,\" Breeding said. \"I know firsthand after taking this position, my fishing and hunting time has suffered, so there are a lot of sacrifices that Roger made to (serve) and then to run for office a second time. It really says a lot about his dedication to the community and Caroline County.\"Roger devoted his time to coaching Denton Little League softball for many years and later coached in a women's softball league in Centreville.Breeding recalls a time when he was coaching with American Legion baseball and some equipment got misplaced.\"Roger went out of his way to make sure I got it back,\" he said. \"He was always looking out for people. He was a good guy.\"In January 2006, Layton was critically injured in a fire that destroyed his home near Denton. A news report after the fire quoted then Commission President John Cole. \"I have found Roger to be a man of incredible inner strength,\" he said. \"Trusted friends with strength and dedication are hard to find.\"Layton is survived by his wife Faye Layton of Denton, his daughter Jaclyn Crawford (Chris) of Preston, his granddaughter Madison Weston of Denton, his stepfather Ronald Sard, his sister Rena Callahan (Bobby) of Harmony, his brother Duane Sard (Michael Anne) of Cordova; his uncle Emory Davis of Easton, his cousin Richard Davis (Kim) of Easton, his former son-in-law Mike Weston of Crapo and many nieces and nephews.In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his sister Debbie Cosden; three brothers, Michael Cosden, James H. Layton, James L. Cosden; and his aunt Mary Jane Davis.A memorial service to celebrate Layton's life will be held at noon Friday, Oct. 6, at Calvary Baptist Church in Denton, where friends may visit with the family 10:30 a.m to noon.

Our family will miss him. But I know he's in a better place,\" Ronald Isley said in a statement released Thursday by an Isley Brothers publicist.Further details were not immediately available.A Cincinnati native, Rudolph Isley began singing in church with brothers Ronald and O'Kelly (another sibling, Vernon, died at age 13) and was still in his teens when they broke through in the late 1950s with \"Shout,\" a secularized gospel rave that was later immortalized during the toga party scene in \"Animal House.\" The Isleys scored again in the early 1960s with the equally spirited \"Twist and Shout,\" which the Beatles liked so much they used it as the closing song on their debut album and opened with it for their famed 1965 concert at Shea Stadium.The Isleys' other hits included \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You),\" later covered by Rod Stewart, and the Grammy-winning \"It's Your Thing.\" In the 1970s, after younger brother Ernest and Marvin joined the group, they had even greater success with such singles as \"That Lady\" and \"Fight the Power (Part 1)\" and such million-selling albums as \"The Heat Is On\" and \"Go for Your Guns.\" Rudolph Isley left the group in 1989, three years after the sudden death of O'Kelly Isley, to become a Christian minister. He was among the Isleys inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He was predeceased by his wife of nearly 70 years, Betty Seymour, and by his son, Reverend David Seymour. He is survived by his son, Chris Seymour, and by extended family and his many friends. He was almost 97 years old.George was born November 4, 1926 in St.Michaels, Maryland, the only child of George Albert Seymour Sr. and Thelma Krill Seymour.He attended public schools in St. Michaels and in Baltimore, and then joined the army in the closing days of World War II. He served as a sergeant in the US Army Air Corps, 1st Recon Squadron, 8th Air Force, at Kadena, Okinawa, from1945 to 1946, first as an aviation mechanic, then in the Information and Education Office, where he edited a newspaper called \"Recon Roundup,\" managed the radio station, KRW, and originated and led island history tours for squadron personnel.Returning to civilian life, George graduated cum laude with a BA in Literature from Western Maryland College in 1950, and then earned a Master of Social Work from the University of Pennsylvania in 1952. The same year, he married Betty Radcliffe, a nurse, also from St.Michaels. Their first son, David, was born in 1955, followed ten and a half months later by Chris. The family lived in Baltimore and Annapolis through the end of the 1960s, moving frequently within that area so that Dave could attend schools suited to his cerebral palsy, before returning to St. Michaels in 1971.Professionally, George served 37 years in various public and private non-profit programs in mental health, juvenile delinquency services, and other services for children. He was the Executive Director of Big Brothers of Baltimore for nine years and of Big Brothers of the National Capital Area for two years. He retired as Chief of Social Work at Eastern Shore Hospital Center, at Cambridge, Maryland, in 1987. He spent his retirement with Betty sailing, traveling, and volunteering. George served as a member of the Maryland State Board of Social Work Examiners for three years and as its chairman for one year. He was the co-founder and first president of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of the Upper Eastern Shore, and he volunteered in a variety of capacities for the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, the Talbot County Historical Society, and the St. Michaels Museum at St. Mary's Square.George not only developed the popular walking tour of sites in St. Michaels related to Frederick Douglass, he was also part of the committee that arranged for the statue of Frederick Douglas now in Easton, and he was the driving force behind the successful effort to dedicate State Route 33 to Frederick Douglass.Over the years, George earned multiple honors, including Social Worker of the Year for 1987; the Heritage Initiative Award, in 2011, for his work on Frederick Douglass' legacy; and, with Betty, the Heritage Award, in 2012, for \"lifetime achievement in research and documentation of local history and volunteerism.\" This past spring, he was able to attend the dedication of the George and Betty Seymour Room at the St. Michael's Museum. Though by then of failing health, he spent the day flirting with the docents and promising to come help at the museum if they should need anything.George did not talk very much-he was convinced that Betty was better at talking than hebut when he did speak in the last few years of his long life, his concerns were for Betty's safety and happiness and that his family be able to enjoy his legacy to them, the beautiful house on the river. He did what he had to do to make all that happen. Also, he wanted a beer and some bacon. We made that happen for him.Services will be held at Framptom Funeral Home, Ostrowski Chapel, 312 S. Talbot Street, in St. Michaels at 11 AM, Saturday, November 4th. Interment will be at Olivet Cemetery.

Her passing was peaceful as she was comforted and held by her youngest daughter, Anne.Ruth was born on August 21st, 1928, to Annie Elmira Eckert and Nevin Emanuel Dietrich in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania. Ruth loved and cherished her sister, Agnes Breidegam and her three brothers, Ivan, Ray, and Lloyd Dietrich, who preceded her in death.After graduating from high school, Ruth attended Mansfield State Teacher's College, in Pennsylvania. A devoted student, Ruth, earned a BA in Education, with French as her minor.She completed a graduate degree at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.She was a believer in attaining education and she so enjoyed learning, especially foreign languages.She was fluent in German and French.Ruth was a teacher for several years in New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania.Ruth married the late Hubert Chester Santucci on August 22,1953, in Hershey, Pennsylvania.Upon their move to Easton, Maryland, Ruth continued teaching for several more years at St. Michaels High School. Following the births of her daughters, she focused on raising her children and supporting her husband, Hubert, as he continued his employment as principal of Easton High School, and later as Supervisor of Instruction at the Talbot County School Board.Ruth was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. She always said she would \"fight tigers for her daughters\". She was a nurturer, a protector, and provided calm council for her family. As her husband's health declined, she was his strength. A quiet sentinel at his casket, gently placing his sleep toboggan on his head, so he wouldn't feel cold. A calm enduring presence following his death to give comfort to all the family who were grieving.Ruth was of the Depression Era. She never asked for much and was content with what she did have. She always put others feelings ahead of her own and it was most important for her to conduct herself in a ladylike manner. She never wanted to cause distress or inconvenience for anyone. A resilient lady, calm in a crisis, always lending emotional support to others.A member of St. Peter and Paul Catholic Church, Ruth had a strong faith. She did not fear death. She was confident she would be surrounded by her loved ones when she passed.Ruth is survived by her daughters, Lisa Santucci Dunphy, Amy Santucci Parrish, and Anne Kay Santucci; granddaughter, Kathryn Taylor Raver and her husband, Adam; grandson, William Chester Parrish, and his wife, Arianne; her great-grandchildren James Hubert Raver and Peyton Louis Raver; her sons-in-law, John Dunphy and Randy Parrish. Ruth will be cremated and her remains will be buried with her cherished husband, Hubert Chester Santucci, at the Eastern Shore Veteran's Cemetery.As Ruth had a love of learning and teaching, in lieu of flowers, she would have appreciated a donation to the Talbot County Free Library of Easton, Maryland. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "K. Diane Baumgartner\n\n January 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 6 | Section: Obituaries \n \n 910\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS - K. Diane Baumgartner, a beacon of light whose vibrant spirit danced through the currents of life, passed away surrounded by the love of her husband and children on November 9, 2023. Born on September 30, 1949, to John Walter Baumgartner and Anna Elizabeth Bell, Diane grew up on a family farm before moving to Vienna, MD where she embraced every aspect of life with an adventurous and joyful heart, spending many of her days at her grandmothers' home playing the piano.Diane's passion for movement brought her and Edward Farley together through the rhythmic steps of contra dancing in 2004. Their souls intertwined, leading to a seaside wedding in Florida on February 29, 2008. As partners in life, they sailed through the ebbs and flows, dancing along many shores and anchored their lives not far from the water's edge in St. Michaels, MD.\nDiane, a devoted mother, shared her boundless love with her children Michael Hawkins, Ashley Dejter, Alex Hawkins, and Nick Hawkins, whose lives she shaped alongside Chester Hawkins. Her nurturing heart extended to her eldest grandson Maison Hawkins, whom she raised for 12 years. Affectionately known as 'Mom-mom,' she enveloped her grandchildren Ethan Hawkins, Cru Dejter, Eleanora Hawkins, Wade Dejter, Nolan Hawkins, Axel Hawkins, Beau Hawkins, and Ezra Hawkins in the warmth of her love, as vast and embracing as the ocean itself.\nDiane's siblings - Nancy Reid, John Baumgartner, Don 'Bumpy' Baumgartner, and Betty Anne 'Bee' Harding- were her close friends in life's journey. Together with Bee, they raised their children side by side, their laughter echoing through countless ocean vacations.\nHer essence was one of acceptance and empathy, a sanctuary for others, offering a peace that calmed the worries of many. Her children recall a home where anger was a stranger, and life's lessons were learned through living rather than lecturing. Diane's intuitive nature and presence made you feel like the center of her universe, a feeling cherished by all who knew her.\nDiane's diverse professional endeavors, spanning three distinct careers, were a unified expression of her deep exploration into various cultural practices of healing the human body.\nHer first act was as a dancer, gracing stages with performances that captured the hearts of audiences and the praise of critics. A graduate of the University of Maryland, she earned her Bachelor of Arts in Dance in 1971, and subsequently, her Master of Arts from the University of Illinois in 1973. Diane's fervor for dance propelled her into the roles of instructor and choreographer at renowned institutions, including her tenure as a dance instructor at Sweet Briar College from 1976 to 1978, an artist in residence at Towson State in 1979, and an assistant professor of dance at Goucher College from 1979 to 1982.\nHer dedication to the arts continued as she choreographed and taught modern and jazz at the Baltimore School for the Arts, the University of Maryland, and the Peabody Conservatory from 1982 to 1984, leaving an indelible mark on the dance community.\nWhen motherhood called, Diane embraced it fully, only to reemerge in her second act as a nurturing nurse. After obtaining her Bachelor of Arts in Nursing from Stevenson University and her Master's from Wesley College, Diane's impact as a nurse was profound and far-reaching.\nKnown endearingly as 'Mrs. B' by the hundreds of students she mentored, Diane's legacy at Anne Arundel Community College and Chesapeake College is measured not just in the over 500 nursing students she educated, but in the countless lives they went on to touch. Her tenure there, which spanned a significant part of her career, was marked by the heartfelt support and unwavering belief she instilled in her students. Beyond her teaching, Diane brought an innovative spirit to Anne Arundel Hospital, where she introduced and developed a Reiki program, weaving her knowledge of holistic practices into the fabric of patient care, thereby enhancing the healing process with the energy and empathy that were the hallmarks of her life's work.\nDiane's zest for life found its zenith in her sixties as she embraced the role of a certified yoga instructor which was not just a pursuit of personal well-being, but an extension of her lifelong commitment to nurturing others. With her characteristic enthusiasm, Diane traversed the world, seeking further certifications and deepening her practice amidst the serenity of these paradises. At the Talbot County Senior Center, she offered her expertise often without charge, making the transformative power of yoga accessible to her community. Her teaching extended to the sandy shores of OBX and Myrtle Beach, where family vacations were graced with her leading yoga sessions against the backdrop of the ocean-a place she felt most at peace.\nThese sessions were more than mere exercises; they were the confluence of Diane's love for the water, her passion for teaching, and her innate ability to bring calm and balance into the lives of those around her, leaving a legacy for her family and community.\nDiane's life was a celebration, a dance of joy, love, and compassion. As we bid her farewell, we invite you to share in a celebration of her life, honoring a soul that moved gracefully through this world, leaving behind a legacy of love and cherished memories.\nCelebration of Life Service: January 7, 2024 3 PM at Living Waters Assembly in Denton, Md In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Living Waters Assembly, 9058 Double Hills Rd, Denton, MD 21629 \"May the waves carry you home, and the dance never end.\"\nFor online condolences, visit www.fhnfuneralhome.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was 102.Her death was confirmed by her commercial agent, Lori Sale, who called Apfel \"extraordinary.\" No cause of death was given. It was also announced on her verified Instagram page on Friday, which a day earlier had celebrated that Leap Day represented her 102nd-and-a-half birthday.\nBorn Aug. 29, 1921, Apfel was famous for her irreverent, eye-catching outfits, mixing haute couture and oversized costume jewelry. A classic Apfel look would, for instance, pair a feather boa with strands of chunky beads, bangles and a jacket decorated with Native American beadwork.\nWith her big, round, black-rimmed glasses, bright red lipstick and short white hair, she stood out at every fashion show she attended.\nHer style was the subject of museum exhibits and a documentary film, \"Iris,\" directed by Albert Maysles.\n\"I'm not pretty, and I'll never be pretty, but it doesn't matter,\" she once said. \"I have something much better.

She always gave back, not for recognition or anything; she gave back from her heart,\" Daniel Mautz, Diana's son, said.\nOriginally from Galion, Ohio, Diana Mautz spent her life making St. Michaels home for her and her family. She led a life of leadership, mentorship and philanthropy.\nHer family and friends described her as an invincible force shaping the St. Michaels Business Association and helping transform the local economy.\nMautz attended Saint Xavier University in Chicago, Illinois, before meeting and then marrying her husband, John Fredrick Mautz.\nShe moved to St. Michaels shortly after the birth of her first son, Johnny Mautz, in 1970, so she could follow her love for sailing. Four years later, she gave birth to her son Daniel.\nMautz built one of the East Coast's most extensive junior sailing programs. She directed junior sailing programs at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, the Tred Avon Yacht Club, the Miles River Yacht Club and what was then known as the Talbot County YMCA.\nJohnny Mautz said his mother's love for sailing and teaching kids to sail was a driving force in her life. He said she instilled a competitive spirit in her students. Many of the kids she taught went on to sail competitively, and some even went on to the Olympics.\nCathy Schmidt, a friend of Mautz's, said they taught sailing side by side for 25 years.\n\"Deep in our hearts, we all wanted our students to love sailing, and silliness was the perfect catalyst,\" Schmidt said. \"Scavenger hunts, 4th of July boat parades, popsicle stick Olympics, candy mark, instructor paddling races, turtle dancing and field trips all over the river too numerous to mention, unlock our inner child when mentioned between old sailing friends. These precious memories are, in a way, Diana's legacy.\"\nIn 1979, unbeknownst to her husband, Diana Mautz purchased Carpenter Street Saloon on C-Street in St. Michaels, which still operates today as one of the remaining iconic Eastern Shore gathering spots.\nWhen Mautz purchased the saloon, it was not a place people considered a shining star, her family said, but she saw potential.\n\"She went in and found the best in everyone,\" Johnny Mautz said. \"They may have been the roughest crowd around in that bar, but they were the sweetest of men and women … All of them had hearts and souls of gold.\"\nDaniel Mautz said his mom transformed the saloon into a calm place. He said her work in the saloon taught her many lessons and helped her grow as a business owner and leader.\nJohnny Mautz recounted how, as a child, witnessing men trying to intimidate her, his mother would just look them right in the eye and not back down.\n\"She did things that most women didn't do,\" he said. \"She had no concern, and she had no fear about saying, 'I'm gonna do this.' I think a lot of the men at the time were a little taken aback by this 'pushy gal,' but she was never pushy. She was assertive, and she was never afraid.\"\nDaniel Mautz said he learned from his mother not to back down from a challenge and to be persistent with his goals.\nHer family said that Mautz found a way to organize, encourage and lead volunteers to meet the community's needs in every place she lived.\nIn lieu of flowers, her family has established a Diana Mautz Legacy Fund. They ask that checks are made payable to Foundation for Community Development Inc. or any other correspondence to address 23942 N. Porters Creek Lane, St. Michaels 21663. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Pioneering sex therapist Westheimer dies at 96\n\n July 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: National \n \n 1402\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n NEW YORK — Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the diminutive sex therapist who became a pop icon, media star and best-selling author through her frank talk about once-taboo bedroom topics, has died. She was 96.Westheimer died on Friday at her home in New York City, surrounded by her family, according to publicist and friend Pierre Lehu.\nWestheimer never advocated risky sexual behavior. Instead, she encouraged an open dialogue on previously closeted issues that affected her audience of millions. Her one recurring theme was there was nothing to be ashamed of.\n\"I still hold old-fashioned values and I'm a bit of a square,\" she told students at Michigan City High School in 2002. \"Sex is a private art and a private matter. But still, it is a subject we must talk about.\"\nWestheimer's giggly, German-accented voice, coupled with her 4-foot-7 frame, made her an unlikely looking — and sounding — outlet for \"sexual literacy.\" The contradiction was one of the keys to her success.\nBut it was her extensive knowledge and training, coupled with her humorous, nonjudgmental manner, that catapulted her local radio program, \"Sexually Speaking,\" into the national spotlight in the early 1980s. She had an open approach to what two consenting adults did in the privacy of their home.\n\"Tell him you're not going to initiate,\" she told a concerned caller in June 1982. \"Tell him that Dr. Westheimer said that you're not going to die if he doesn't have sex for one week.\"\nAs a sign of her appeal across the generations and social culture, tributes came from actor-comedian Adam Sandler — \"She always made us smile,\" he wrote on X — to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who appointed Westheimer the state's Ambassador of Loneliness. \"May her memory be a blessing,\" said the governor in a statement. \"She was brave, funny, candid and brilliant.\"\nHer radio success opened new doors, and in 1983 she wrote the first of more than 40 books: \"Dr. Ruth's Guide to Good Sex,\" demystifying sex with both rationality and humor. There was even a board game, Dr. Ruth's Game of Good Sex.\nShe soon became a regular on the late-night television talk-show circuit, bringing her personality to the national stage. Her rise coincided with the early days of the AIDS epidemic, when frank sexual talk became a necessity.\n\"If we could bring about talking about sexual activity the way we talk about diet — the way we talk about food — without it having this kind of connotation that there's something not right about it, then we would be a step further. But we have to do it with good taste,\" she told Johnny Carson in 1982.\nShe normalized the use of words like \"penis\" and \"vagina\" on radio and TV, aided by her Jewish grandmotherly accent, which The Wall Street Journal once said was \"a cross between Henry Kissinger and Minnie Mouse.\" People magazine included her in their list of \"The Most Intriguing People of the Century.\" She even made it into a Shania Twain song: \"No, I don't need proof to show me the truth/Not even Dr. Ruth is gonna tell me how I feel.\"\nWestheimer defended abortion rights, suggested older people have sex after a good night's sleep and was an outspoken advocate of condom use. She believed in monogamy.\nIn the 1980s, she stood up for gay men at the height of the AIDS epidemic and spoke out loudly for the LGBTQ community. She said she defended people deemed by some far-right Christians to be \"subhuman\" because of her own past.\nBorn Karola Ruth Siegel in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1928, she was an only child. At 10, she was sent by her parents to Switzerland to escape Kristallnacht — the Nazis' 1938 pogrom that served as a precursor to the Holocaust. She never saw her parents again; Westheimer believed they were killed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz.\nAt the age of 16, she moved to Palestine and joined the Haganah, the underground movement for Israeli independence. She was trained as a sniper, although she said she never shot at anyone.\nHer legs were severely wounded when a bomb exploded in her dormitory, killing many of her friends. She said it was only through the work of a \"superb\" surgeon that she could walk and ski again.\nShe married her first husband, an Israeli soldier, in 1950, and they moved to Paris as she pursued an education. Although not a high school graduate, Westheimer was accepted into the Sorbonne to study psychology after passing an entrance exam.\nThe marriage ended in 1955; the next year, Westheimer went to New York with her new boyfriend, a Frenchman who became her second husband and father to her daughter, Miriam.\nIn 1961, after a second divorce, she finally met her life partner: Manfred Westheimer, a fellow refugee from Nazi Germany. The couple was married and had a son, Joel. They remained wed for 36 years until \"Fred\" — as she called him — died of heart failure in 1997.\nAfter receiving her doctorate in education from Columbia University, she went on to teach at Lehman College in the Bronx. While there she developed a specialty — instructing professors how to teach sex education. It would eventually become the core of her curriculum.\n\"I soon realized that while I knew enough about education, I did not really know enough about sex,\" she wrote in her 1987 autobiography. Westheimer then decided take classes with the renowned sex therapist, Dr. Helen Singer Kaplan.\nIt was there that she had discovered her calling. Soon, as she once said in a typically folksy comment, she was dispensing sexual advice \"like good chicken soup.\"\n\"I came from an Orthodox Jewish home so sex for us Jews was never considered a sin,\" she told The Guardian in 2019.\nIn 1984, her radio program was nationally syndicated. A year later, she debuted in her own television program, \"The Dr. Ruth Show,\" which went on to win an Ace Award for excellence in cable television.\nShe also wrote a nationally syndicated advice column and later appeared in a line of videos produced by Playboy, preaching the virtues of open sexual discourse and good sex. She even had a series of calendars.\nHer rise was noteworthy for the culture of the time, in which then-President Ronald Reagan's administration was hostile to Planned Parenthood and aligned with pro-conservative voices.\nPhyllis Schlafly, a staunch anti-feminist, wrote in a 1999 piece \"The Dangers of Sex Education,\" that Westheimer, as well as Gloria Steinem, Anita Hill, Madonna, Ellen DeGeneres and others were promoting \"provocative sex chatter\" and \"rampant immorality.\"\nFather Edwin O'Brien, the director of communications for the Catholic archdiocese of New York who would go on to become a cardinal, called her work upsetting and morally compromised.\n\"It's pure hedonism,\" O'Brien wrote in a 1982 opinion published by The Wall Street Journal. \"The message is just indulge yourself; whatever feels good is good. There is no higher law of overriding morality, and there's also no responsibility.\"\nWestheimer made appearances on \"The Howard Stern Radio Show,\" \"Nightline,\" \"The Tonight Show,\" \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" \"The Dr. Oz Show\" and \"Late Night with David Letterman.\" She played herself in episodes of \"Quantum Leap\" and \"Love Boat: The Next Wave.\"\nHer books include \"Sex for Dummies,\" her autobiographical works \"All in a Lifetime\" (1987) and \"Musically Speaking: A Life through Song\" (2003). The documentary \"Ask Dr. Ruth\" aired in 2019.\nDuring her time as a radio and television personality, she remained committed to teaching, with posts at Yale, Hunter, Princeton and Columbia universities and a busy college lecture schedule. She also maintained a private practice throughout her life.\nWestheimer received an honorary doctorate from Hebrew Union College-Institute of Religion for her work in human sexuality and her commitment to the Jewish people, Israel and religion. In 2001 she received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor and the Leo Baeck Medal, and in 2004, she received the degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa, from Trinity College.\nRyan White, the director of \"Ask Dr. Ruth,\" told Vice in 2019 that Westheimer was never someone following trends. She was always an ally of gay rights and an advocate for family planning.\n\"She was at the forefront of both of those things throughout her entire life. I met her friends from her orphanage saying even when she met gay people throughout her life in the '30s, '40s, and '50s she was always accepting of those people and always saying that people should be treated with respect.\"\nShe is survived by two children, Joel and Miriam, and four grandchildren. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hurley Sr. lived and breathed the Rescue Fire Company.\"It was definitely in his heart,\" said longtime friend and fellow fireman Dorchester County Council Member Ricky Travers.\nHurley, who died Jan. 23 at 68 years old, held a membership with Rescue Fire Company for 47 years, serving in a variety of roles.\nHe served as president from 1983 through 1985. In 1986, Hurley took on the title of first assistant chief before becoming chief for the first time in 1990. All in all, Hurley served as chief of the fire company from 1990 to 1994, from 1996 to 2002 and from 2004 to 2010.\nIn 2004, he was made a life member of the fire company.\nTravers said Hurley was an advocate who helped move Rescue Fire Company forward.\n\"He fought with the city to make sure that they knew we were a part of the city and that they had to get the building permits to run through us,\" Travers said.\nAccording to a social media post from Rescue Fire Company, even after his last term as chief, Hurley would still show up to fire incidents from time to time, sharing his expertise with firemen.\n\"My phone rang once or twice a week with him,\" said current Rescue Fire Chief Brad Walters, laughing.\nWalters, who in his first years with the company worked under Hurley, said Hurley was a \"strong-willed\" leader who fought for what the department needed.\n\"He was the cornerstone of where we are and how we operate now,\" Walters said. \"Every piece of apparatus inside the fire house at this time has his name attached to it in some manner. Whether he was on the committee, whether he was the chief overseeing it. Specifically, some of the engines. He fought extremely hard with the city to purchase the needed equipment for our department.\"\nWalters said Hurley was also \"kind hearted.\" He said he remembers Hurley helping him out and giving him side jobs when he was younger.\n\"He was there to make sure everyone excelled around him,\" Walters said.\nHurley served his community in more ways than one. He spent his career at Jess Jr's & Son's, a collision repair shop and towing service in Cambridge. He served in multiple positions as a member of the Cambridge Yacht Club, ultimately becoming the club's commodore.\nHis involvement spanned from the Cambridge Rotary Club, to the Maryland State Firefighters Association, to the Maryland Fire Chiefs Association to the Towing and Recovery Professionals of Maryland.\n\"He was a leader in the community,\" Travers said.\nHurley will be remembered for his friendship. Martin Pepper, who met Hurley in 1986 and served multiple years as assistant chief when Hurley was chief, said Hurley was very important to him.\n\"He was a very good friend to me,\" Pepper said. \"Good friend to a lot of people, but we were very close.\"\nDuring a Cambridge City Council meeting on Jan. 27, Commission President Sputty Cephas talked about his friendship with Hurley.\n\"There wasn't a time that we couldn't go to Jeff for whatever,\" he said, later adding, that Hurley will \"truly\" be missed.\nHurley is survived by his son, Jeffery O. Hurley Jr. (Sarah); bonus sons Joshua Bauguess (Kayla) and Noah Bauguess (Deanna); brother Jed M. Hurley Sr. (Brenda); nephew Jed \"J.R.\" Hurley Jr. (Abbie); niece Amanda Jo Hurley Hallowell (Logan); great nieces Abriella Hallowell, Leilani Hallowell and Maddie Hurley; great nephew Jed M. Hurley III and God children Brandon Hall, JR Moore and Maddie Fleming.\nHurley is preceded in death by his parents, daughter Jessica Anne Hurley and his brother, Jay L. Hurley.\nServices will be held Friday, Jan. 31. A visitation will be held from 10 a.m. to noon at the Public Safety Building at 8 Washington St. in Cambridge. The visitation will be followed by a firefighter memorial service at noon at the Public Safety Building. After that, a brief procession will pass by Jess Jr's & Son's and the old fire house at 307 Gay St. before entering Dorchester Memorial Park for burial services. A wake will be held after the burial at the East New Market Volunteer Fire Department. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Robert Earl Price, poet, playwright and arts advocate dies\n\n May 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 591\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Robert Earl Price, a celebrated poet, playwright, and champion of African American culture, died April 16 at the age of 83. Price, a former screenwriter during the Black Arts Movement and an influential figure in the arts community, spent the final 18 years of his life in Chestertown, where he co-founded the Kent County Poetry Festival, worked extensively with the Kent Cultural Alliance and contributed to preserving local African American history.Price was a prolific writer with several books of poetry, including \"Wise Blood\" and \"Blood Flow\", the latter of which earned him the William Meredith Award. His work transcended genres, with over a dozen of his plays produced, including notable works like \"Blue Monk\", which was commissioned for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. His plays were performed internationally, with productions in Johannesburg, Berlin, and across the United States.\nPrice's career spanned several decades and locations. Born in Atlanta, Georgia, he studied at Clark Atlanta University and later moved to Los Angeles, where he joined the Black Arts Movement and contributed to the L.A. Rebellion. He received the prestigious William Wyler Fellowship for Screenwriting from the American Film Institute, and collaborated with well-known figures such as Norman Lear and Alex Haley on the TV series \"Palmerstown, U.S.A.\" His work earned him an NAACP Image Award and recognition for his activism, including co-founding the Black Anti-Defamation Coalition in 1980.\nIn addition to his achievements in screenwriting and theater, Price was a dedicated educator. He served as Artist-in-Residence at Washington College in Chestertown, where he wrote and produced two new plays. His work also contributed to understanding slavery during the Revolutionary Era, particularly through productions such as \"The Unlading\", a work that gave better perception of the role of slavery in Eastern Shore history.\nPrice's poetry and plays often incorporated jazz and blues, blending these musical forms with themes of resistance and social justice. His work explored African American history, celebrated cultural icons, and pushed the boundaries of traditional theater. His friends and colleagues remember him for his sharp wit, deep wisdom, and unwavering belief in the power of art to challenge the status quo.\nChristopher Ames, president emeritus of Russell Sage College, worked with Price in both Atlanta and Chestertown. \"I first met Robert Earl when I was serving on the board of 7Stages, the innovative theater company in Atlanta, where he was the Playwright in Residence. Later, when I moved to Chestertown to serve as Provost and Dean at Washington College, I was thrilled to hire Robert Earl as a part-time Artist in Residence in the Drama Department,\" Ames said. \"He and his wife embraced this community, and Robert Earl's impact was immediate and lasting. Together, we conceived the Kent County Poetry Festival with the help of Tom Martin and The Book Plate. Robert Earl was not just a co-founder; he was the heartbeat of the festival, present and actively organizing every year until this last April, when he was on his deathbed. His passion for poetry, community, and the arts was unmatched, and his legacy will continue to influence the festival and the arts scene here for years to come.\"\nA devoted father and grandfather, Price is survived by his partner of 33 years, Carol Colgate; three children, Dhati Price, Makini Jones (Elzia), and Mshinda Jones (Lisa); five grandchildren, Ariana, Phylicia, Philip, Jamal, and Bashiri Halan; and one great-grandson, Brayden.\nA memorial service will be held in Chestertown June 21.\nPrice's legacy as a poet, playwright, and cultural advocate will continue to inspire and shape the Eastern Shore arts community for years to come. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
