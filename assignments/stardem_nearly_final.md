# Star-Democrat Nearly Final Beat Book

Given the feedback you've received, refine your chosen beat book to improve its structure, quality and accuracy. The goal here is to submit a nearly final beat book, so now is the last time to try new things or go deep on some aspect. In your repository, create a stardem_better folder and create a `notes.md` file in it. Put any JSON or other files you need in that directory and describe your process in the `notes.md` file. Be sure to include any problems you weren't able to overcome and an evaluation of your draft beat book. If you have remaining questions - things you don't know how to do - now's the time to include them. At the end of your Copilot conversation, ask Copilot to create a narrative summary of your conversation in a file called `copilot.md`.

When you are finished, add, commit and push those files and submit the URL of your `notes.md` file in ELMS.

### Getting Started

In your class repository, open a codespace and do the following:

1. In the Terminal, cd into the directory with your last name.
2. Create a directory called `stardem_nearly_final` using mkdir
3. cd into that new directory
4. Create a file called `notes.md` using touch and open it
5. Put "Star-Democrat Nearly Final Beat Book" and today's date at the top, then save it
