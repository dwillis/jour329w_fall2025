Sammons\n\n August 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 8 | Section: Obituaries \n \n 518\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - Audrey Virginia Wilcox Sammons, wife of Jack Sammons, of Cambridge, passed away on Monday, August 7, 2023. Born in Cambridge, Maryland on March 9, 1936, she was the daughter of Odie W. Wilcox and Iona Amelia Rhea Wilcox. Audrey grew up in Cassons Neck on the Rhea family farm until her family moved into a home meticulously built by hand by her father. Audrey spent her childhood with her sister, Irene Wilcox Thomas, surrounded by grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.Audrey graduated from Cambridge High School in 1954 and attended Goldy Beacom College until marrying her first husband, Robert E Anderson. Audrey and Bobby had three daughters, Lisa (Tom) Neild, Patricia (Tommy) Hallowell, and Jennifer (Guy III) Edgar, all of Dorchester County.Audrey was a gifted artist, played piano and organ, and was a talented seamstress. She played piano for the Men's Class of St. Paul's church, where she was a member for many years.In May, 1976 Audrey and Jack were married.While they were working full-time, they spent weekends on home improvement projects, with Audrey being skilled in carpentry taught to her by her father. They built kitchen cabinets by hand, refinished furniture and built additions to their home. As grandchildren came along, Audrey and Jack took them on short excursions to the Catoctin Mountains, a favorite journey for Audrey. Once she and Jack both retired they purchased a motor home and spent weeks at a time traveling the countryside, making friends from Florida to Canada.Audrey loved to garden. Rather, she loved shopping for plants, and would spend hours on the road with Jack searching for favorites and new plants to try. It was nothing for them to travel to Florida in the motor home and come back loaded down with plants. Audrey also loved shopping for bargains. Jack was her constant companion, good natured about driving the countryside in her quests.Audrey and Jack shared 47 years of love. When aphasia presented itself and Audrey found it more difficult to communicate, Jack was there for her continually.In addition to her beloved husband, Jack, and her daughters and sons-in-law, she is survived by stepchildren Steve Sammons and Cindy Sammons Hill, grandchildren Marcia Neild Groton, Lee Neild, TJ Hallowell, Logan Hallowell and Guy Edgar IV, Adam Sammons, Amber Sammons Salvadore, Ben Hill, Shawn Hill, Tyler Hill, Kaitlyn Hill, 14 great grandchildren, a brother in law J. Thomas Anderson and several nieces, nephews and cousins. She is preceded in death by her parents and her sister M. Irene Thomas and her husband Dick Thomas.The family thanks with gratitude the staff of Mallard Bay, including Amanda Hallowell, Audrey's granddaughter-in-law, all who provided exceptional care to Audrey over the last two years. Everyone's dedication to patients made this transition for Audrey and family easier to bear.A funeral service will be held on Friday, August 11, 2023 at 1 pm at Thomas Funeral Home, P.A. in Cambridge with Mr. Gary Hickman officiating. Interment will follow at Spedden Seward Cemetery. Family will receive friends one hour prior to the service.

Dr.Gieske was born October 3rd, 1938 in Baltimore to Mr. Edward T. and Mary Clare Chapman Gieske. He attended Calvert School, Gilman School, Princeton University ('61), and Johns Hopkins Medical School ('65). At Hopkins, he met and married fellow student, Judith Porter, beginning an exemplary 59-year marriage.Jim then trained in Boston in general, pediatric, thoracic, and cardiac surgery. In 1967, he began Naval Service in Norfolk and served as a Medical Officer aboard USS Georgetown during the Vietnam War. In 1973, he and Judi moved to Easton where he opened a surgical practice while Judi practiced pediatrics, and they raised three sons.Jim's breadth of training enabled him to meet the surgical needs of a wide variety of patients and he practiced with the spirit of a country doctor in Easton's small community. Those who worked with him in the operating room remember him as skilled, poised, caring, and amusing.He co-founded Delmarva Foundation for Medical Care, which is now Qlarant, and chaired the Medical Ethics Committee at Memorial Hospital. In retirement, he served on the board of Talbot Hospice and remained a resource for friends, family, and anyone who came his way in need of comfort and medical guidance. He also trained doctors in Kazakhstan and helped modernize medical care in Vietnam.Settling on the Eastern Shore in 1973 was a return home, as Jim was preceded by four generations of Chapmans in Chestertown and, as a boy, he learned to sail on the Chester River. An avid sailor, Jim raced locally and offshore before he and Judi, in 1992, realized a dream which he had nurtured for decades: to sail into blue water over the horizon. Their thirst for adventure not fully quenched by a two year trip around the Caribbean, they then spent many summers traveling the canals of France by barge, embarked on several voyages to the Arctic and Antarctic, and recently traveled to the Galapagos.Dr. James Gieske rests now in peace, a man whose generosity of spirit, passion for adventure, and quest for learning never waned. He is survived by his wife, Dr. Judith Gieske, sons Chapman, Porter (Sarah), and Hardy (Vanessa), and grandchildren Sebastian, Chloe, Dash, and Juniper. Memorial donations can be made to Mid-Shore Community Foundation, designated to ITCH, an Introduction To Careers in Healthcare serving public middle schools, Jim and Judi's most recent endeavor begun only three months ago. Honor Dr. Gieske's life and extend well wishes to his family at Third Haven Meetinghouse at 405 S Washington St in Easton on Wednesday, August 23rd from 12-3pm. Burial services will be private. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Maryanne was a beloved friend, sister, aunt, devoted mother, grandmother, and loving spouse.Born in Amityville, NY on January 31, 1957 to Hugh and Marilyn Burr, Maryanne grew up on Long Island as the fifth of six children. Maryanne spent her high school years at North Babylon where she ran track and field, played trumpet and worked at Carvel Ice Cream.After graduation, Maryanne left New York to attend the University of Maryland, College Park where she met her future husband during her time as first trumpet in the \"Mighty Sound of Maryland\" Marching Band. They married in 1977 and built their home in the community of Hurlock, MD where they would raise three children and create countless memories for the next 45 years.Maryanne worked for University of Maryland Shore Regional Health for 40 years as a physical therapy aide, rotating between outpatient centers and Easton Hospital. She was known for her compassion, patience, respect, and for always greeting others with a smile and open ear.She loved people and people loved her.A member of Unity Washington United Methodist Church in Hurlock from the year they moved, Maryanne was an active member of the congregation and served on the Deborah Circle. Religion was a pillar in her life and she built lifelong friendships from the community found there. Maryanne invested deeply in her relationships and the return on her love manifested itself tenfold in the care and kindness she and her family have been afforded in the last few weeks.As a mother, Maryanne dedicated her life to her children. It's easy for families to get distracted as children grow, but she made it her mission to be the magnet to hold things together. She supported all of their ambitions, was prepared to catch them anytime they fell, and was ready with a call, an ear, and open arms whenever they were needed and even when they weren't.She loved her grandchildren. She matched their energy until the end and knew all of their interests and loves, catering all of her homemade cards for holidays and birthdays to be specifically personalized and cherished forever.She attended any event or game she could and turned her yard into a haven of ziplines, swings, ninjalines and games. She was revered.Maryanne loved her husband, Michael, and while she was most at peace in her gardens at home, they spent the last number of years traveling around the United States driving Route 1 in California, hiking the Grand Canyon at sunset, relaxing in Florida and visiting family all over. The two built a beautiful life on Palmers Mill.The loss of Maryanne leaves a deep hole in our family. She is survived by her mother, Marilyn Burr (Hugh, deceased); husband Michael, son Cory (Lisa), daughter Amanda, son Alex (Megan); grandchildren Livvie, Carter, Ellie, Kinsley, Douglas, Dean, and Annie; siblings Bruce (Terry), Glen, Andy, Ian, Kenny (Cheryl), and several incredible nephews and nieces.Maryanne was a light, she was loved immensely, and she leaves a deep legacy for her family and friends. She beat the odds and courageously battled stage four breast cancer for the last six years. While she fought quietly, she was and has always been surrounded by a group of women who carried her through.A celebration of life will be held at Unity Washington United Methodist Church in Hurlock on Saturday, August 19, 2023 at 3pm. Those who wish to visit are welcomed to join the family at 2pm.In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to the Blessings Bags initiative, something Maryanne respected and admired. To date, over 6,500 care packages have been delivered to patients undergoing cancer treatment.

    "content": "Jim Gieske led a life of medicine, adventure and family\n\n August 17, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom Mccall; tmccall@chespub.com | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 1490\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Dr. James Chapman Gieske died of cardiac arrest on Aug. 10, 2023, at University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton, formerly known as Memorial Hospital, a place where he cared for many patients over the years. He was 84.Gieske was a lover of medicine, sailing adventures, orchids and family. A Princeton and Johns Hopkins trained surgeon he gave up the glitz of a skyrocketing career and settled on the Eastern Shore to raise a family and care for his patients.Often patients would barter with him for the ducks they had shot to get a surgery performed. This was long before health insurance took over the art of medicine.So, he said yes to ducks, crabs and even crates of lobster.At heart, he was a country doctor.His son Hardy remarked on how challenging it was as a young family man with two kids.\"Jim was in the Navy and sent off on a spy ship for seven months and couldn't tell his wife where he was going. He told mom, 'Don't know where I am going and don't know when I will be back.' He missed (brother) Porter's birth and was gone from September 1968 through Porter's second birthday. His kids were little, and I think that experience really told him to cool down. Be a dad. So, he went from being a really highly trained general pediatric thoracic cardiac surgeon. He was going to be a big wig.That experience made him want to chill and become a small country doctor. He thought, 'I want to bring my expertise to who ever comes through the door.' He probably charged 0% to 25% of his patients. We had a freezer in the garage that would be full of soft shell crabs, oysters and chickens and hams,\" Hardy said.Gieske started an insurance company out of dissatisfaction.It was the Delmarva Foundation for Medical Care. With a few other doctors he created what is now the data analysis behemoth Qlarant.\"He could feel the momentum of the business of medicine becoming too important. He was trying to keep it at bay and keep things ethical,\" Hardy said.Gieske's wife of 59 years Judi said, \"Jim always said, 'I am for the people.'\" On the home front, this introvert turned to the pursuit of keeping orchids alive in a greenhouse. To discover how he got to these sublime and notoriously difficult to cultivate flowers, one has to start at the Aspen Institute in Wye Mills.Judi said, \"We became part of a group that would work there and have dinner with this distinguished man Arthur Houghton.They wanted us on Thursday night before Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Because if the Ambassador to France or Germany or Kissinger or a Supreme Court Justice was there for a private meeting at the Aspen Institute, they wanted token locals to not talk about anything else on Thursday night. Often I would sit next to the owner.He gave the place away and he had to give his greenhouse away. He did not want to give it to the state, so he said to Jimmy, 'I understand you love orchids.' That is when we put the greenhouse in. We inherited 50 orchids.\" Jim Gieske led two lives as both a country mouse and a city mouse. He was just as home with watermen as he was Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, banker and philanthropist Frank and Trisha Saul and former National Gallery Director Rusty and Nancy Powell.He enjoyed many New Year's dinners with this group.He was remembered in an Annapolis courtroom last week before court got started.\"Before we get started with the cases I want to take a moment to publicly acknowledge Jim Gieske.He was a doctor, who near as I can tell operated on just about everyone I have met this side of Easton. One time I was looking for his home in a rural area. So I stopped and asked a bunch of farmers if they knew how to find Dr.Gieske's home and instead of just giving me direction each farmer would pull up his shirt and show me some scar or manifestation where Dr. Gieske had helped them out at one point. Thank you, Dr. Gieske,\" said Hon. Mark Crooks, Fifth Judicial Circuit Associate Judge of Anne Arundel County.Like all men there is the public self and the private.\"In public, he was a formal guy and liked to have intellectual conversations; the other side of him always like to have his hands in the dirt. There was a very casual organic unfettered simplicity to him. Gardening and sailing and medicine and all these collisions of the deeply intellectual study of something like music and just being in real life,\" Hardy said.He had a long standing movie night date with lawyer JT Smith. They did not watch rom coms and instead went for a thoughtful diet of Bergman, Hitchcock and Kurosawa. Smith would make the salad, and Gieske would bring the burgers.Once a month for 15 years the tradition held. Often times discussions would turn political, but Smith recalled Gieske being very persuasive and thoughtful even in his contrarian opposition.Gieske also loved to listen to classical music and later in life took up the ukalele. He was not great, but he taught himself the opening of Bach's Cello Suite on the ukalele.He would study different versions of a single composition.He was also an adventurer.During the Newport to Bermuda race his sail boat filled up with water and needed rescuing.\"I believe it was 1978 or 1979 that he was in the Bermuda races and their boat capsized in the middle of the Atlantic. Dr. Thompson was on the boat as well as Chuck Benson. That was something he often smiled about.They were rescued by the Coast Guard,\" said Dr. Stan Bysshe Jr., a general surgeon.John Knud-Hanson, Gieske and Bysshe were in practice together for over 20 years.They had matching vanity plates KGB 1 and KGB 2 and KGB 3. This was a time before cell phones. All they had were beepers and occasionally a state trooper would come get a surgeon needed, who was out of touch.\"He was extremely gifted with his hands as a surgeon.And you know that whole Dutchman's Lane complex was nothing until we put up the first medical building there and then the second.And then it all blossomed. It all started with 505 Dutchman's Lane. Medicine today is a job, and when we practiced it was a passion. Today it is about how much time do you get off. When Jim and John and I practiced it was medicine and if we were lucky we slotted in family life where we could. What Jim and Judi did was remarkable.To have two active practices and raise three great sons,\" Bysshe said.Years later Gieske bought a live aboard barge and navigated the Seine in France for 10 summers. He also took off to sail around the Caribbean for two years saying, \"We don't know where we are going and we are going for and indefinite amount of time. Are you up for it?\" He took his wife and his son Hardy. Hardy taught his mom how to sail on the way.Even after his two year sailing hiatus with his wife, Gieske never practiced in a hospital again, but he gave hundreds of consultations in his living room. Or he would travel as a physician to remote places like Kazakhstan with Doctors Without Borders, or to Vietnam. In later years, Gieske discovered that if he offered himself up as the adventurous doctor, the doors of access swung open. He served as a doctor in China, Antarctica, the Arctic, Kazakhstan, Vietnam and the Galapagos. He even found himself aboard a Russian fishing vessel.Judi said, \"We had very vigorous medical careers. With retirement, we thought we were looking forward to something with some action.\" On the Joli Coeur (Pretty Heart), they traveled around 5,000 miles in France by barge. There was no shortage of vineyards, fresh bread and gooey cheese to experience aboard the 78-foot pleasure craft. They fell in love with France.Even his last week seemed charmed. He took a trip to Martha's Vineyard and was surrounded his family and grandchildren.The community is invited to honor Gieske's life and extend well wishes to his family from noon to 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 23, at Third Haven Meetinghouse, 405 S. Washington St., Easton. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nDr. James Gieske led a life filled with surgery, boats, orchids and family.\n \nCONTRIBUTED\n \nA 78-foot barge named Joli Coeur (Pretty Heart) was home for Jim and Judi Gieske for many summers. Both doctors, Judi said that they were active in their medical careers, so why not have an active retirement. They fell in the love with the people and food of France and traveled around 5,000 miles.\n \nCONTRIBUTED\n \nAfter graduating from Princeton, Jim Gieske joined the Navy. He was assigned to a spy boat during Vietnam and didn't see his two young children for nearly two years. He had many adventures on boats over the years including sinking a racing sailboat during the Newport to Bermuda race. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

VA - Paul Bojko (86) died August 29, 2023 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Paul was born July 31, 1937 in Kremenchuk, Ukraine to the late Gregor Bojko and the late Charytyna Zelynska Bojko.In a 2016 letter, Paul recounts his early years. \"When I was about six years old German soldiers came to our family farm, loaded us into a truck. We were taken to Auschwitz.When my parents were healthy enough, we were moved by boxcars to a labor camp in Nuremberg. I remember always being hungry, cold and so afraid. When the war ended my father was dead. My mother became hospitalized.My brother and I were placed in a children's home in Bad Aibling Germany where we had good care. In 1951 my brother and I were sent to the United States.\" Living with foster families in Baltimore County Maryland, Paul met Diana Dement.They married in 1959 and created a joyful life and family together, with three sons and many pets. They settled in Parkton MD until moving to Easton MD in 1976 and Trappe MD in 1985.After serving in the military, Paul worked at Black & Decker for 40 years. Caring and resourceful, Paul could build and fix things, and never hesitated to lend a hand to a neighbor.Though a quiet person, he could often be heard in lively \"conversations\" with pets and wildlife.Paul took his family on memorable road trips, including to Chincoteague Island VA, where Paul and Diana moved in 2018. They relished their time together feeding birds, exploring nature trails and watching polka dance on TV with a bowl of ice cream. Diana passed away in 2020.Paul's 2016 letter continued, \"My life here has been good. I am thankful for the freedom this country has given me. If some had lived the life I did as a child of war they might look at things differently.\" In a letter replying to Paul, President Obama said, \"Stories like yours underscore that we must continue to build a world where all people can live together in peace.\" Paul shared his story in a 2017 documentary video for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.Paul is survived by his sons Greg Bojko of Chincoteague Island VA, Richard Bojko of Tacoma WA, and Scott Bojko of Memphis TN; and brother Victor Bojko of Mt.

His talents were many, including his unique perception of life and all it had to offer. Paired with a keen sense of humor, many were entertained.And for the record, most - if not all - stories were true.The keys to his contentment were listening and surrounding himself with great people.Many looked to him for advice over the years.He was almost spiritual that way. He pushed the envelope and loved doing so - a true Chesapeake Bay ambassador. Priorities included fishing, hunting, kayaking, camping, traveling, and, if there was time left over, work. As a husband, father, mentor, and friend, Bud was a renaissance man who wore many hats. He quietly and unselfishly supported many organizations, charities, individuals, and businesses. In short, \"He did it his way.\" Driven and smart, Bud believed in the saying, \"The harder you work, the luckier you are.\" Not perfect by any means, the business lunch took on a whole new meaning when he was on board.Successes include the Baltimore Chamber of Commerce Port Authority, of which he was a top official. His team negotiated the foreign car trade for Baltimore. In addition, he managed the newly formed Maryland Cruises and brought the cruise line terminals to Baltimore (both still active today). With his wife, Karen, the pair ran the Bellevue store and post office as well as Chesapeake Travel and Tours. He also partnered in a large waterfowl guide service, served three governors as a member of the Citizens Advisor Caucus for the Maryland DNR, and created his gem, the long-standing independent Bud Wood Realty.Bud's well-lived life would not have been possible without the efforts and devotion of his loving wife, Karen. She was an incredible, progressive woman who gave everything for our family.Bud was a member of the B.P.O.E. #1622 Easton Elks Lodge, The Board, Miles River Yacht Club, Christ Church Easton, and numerous local organizations.Bud is survived by his loving family, sons Earle \"Roo\" B. Wood III and Christopher C. Wood, granddaughters Caroline Wood and Collette Wood, sister Ellen Wood Walmsley (Bill), and sisters-in law Sandy Wood and Nancy Wood.The son of the late Earle \"Pete\" B. Wood and late Frances M. Wood, Bud is predeceased by his wife Karen J. Wood, daughter Melissa M.Wood, grandson Earle \"Peter\" B. Wood IV, sister Suzanne Wood Turner, and brothers Walter Donald Wood and Marvin \"Larry\" Lawrence Wood.We look forward to being with you at the memorial service for Bud. It will be held on Friday, September 22, 2023, beginning at 11 a.m. in Christ Church Easton (111 S. Harrison Street).Casual dress please, no sports coats (Bud's typical uniform: blue Oxford shirt and khakis preferred). In honor of Bud, please consider donating to the local charity of your choosing or the Prader-Willi Syndrome Association (www.pwsausa.org). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was born in Shavertown, PA, in 1921, the youngest of six children. Music and laughter filled her family home. She loved to sing. Eleanor and two of her sisters comprised a trio that sang in churches throughout Susquehanna Valley, including a live weekly radio broadcast of gospel music.

After the birth of their first child, they moved back to Bob's hometown of Minersville, where their second child was born, and they remained there for seven years. Little Primrose Chapel provided a loving center for their lives, populated as it was by extended family and life-long friends.\"Bob and Eleanor\" birthed four children in all: Fred and Judi, after which, in 1953, the family moved to Ewing, NJ, where the two youngest children were later born: Donald and Janice.Fred married Addie (Smith) of Foxboro, MA, who gave them three grandchildren: Kristen, Jason, and Aaron.

The youngest, Janice, married Scott Petrie of New Hope, PA, rounding out Eleanor's \"grands\" with Megan, Brandon, and Kira Beth. Sixteen great-grandchildren were added in the years to follow.As the Church was always the center of family life, Eleanor continued to use her musical gifts in the service of the worship of God. Her greatest delight and ministry was her expanding family, helping them maintain a strong bond even as they married, bore children, and moved apart. In 2005, her husband of nearly 62 years went to be with the Lord. She lived independently in her home in Ewing until she was 93.In 2014, Eleanor joined her two sons in Cambridge, where she lived happily for five years in a lovely condo overlooking the marinas, crab boats, and the Cambridge drawbridge. At the age of 98, she entered Bayleigh Chase Assisted Living in Easton, where she came to be known and loved by staff and residents for her faith, happy demeanor, and contagious laugh. Eleanor devoted herself to the Lord Jesus, made deep friendships, read the Bible daily, and was a woman of prayer. The Lord called her into his presence at 102 years and four months after a brief decline in health.

His talents were many, including his unique perception of life and all it had to offer. Paired with a keen sense of humor, many were entertained.And for the record, most - if not all - stories were true.The keys to his contentment were listening and surrounding himself with great people.Many looked to him for advice over the years.He was almost spiritual that way. He pushed the envelope and loved doing so - a true Chesapeake Bay ambassador. Priorities included fishing, hunting, kayaking, camping, traveling, and, if there was time left over, work. As a husband, father, mentor, and friend, Bud was a renaissance man who wore many hats. He quietly and unselfishly supported many organizations, charities, individuals, and businesses. In short, \"He did it his way.\"Driven and smart, Bud believed in the saying, \"The harder you work, the luckier you are.\" Not perfect by any means, the business lunch took on a whole new meaning when he was on board.Successes include the Baltimore Chamber of Commerce Port Authority, of which he was a top official. His team negotiated the foreign car trade for Baltimore. In addition, he managed the newly formed Maryland Cruises and brought the cruise line terminals to Baltimore (both still active today). With his wife, Karen, the pair ran the Bellevue store and post office as well as Chesapeake Travel and Tours. He also partnered in a large waterfowl guide service, served three governors as a member of the Citizens Advisor Caucus for the Maryland DNR, and created his gem, the long-standing independent Bud Wood Realty.Bud's well-lived life would not have been possible without the efforts and devotion of his loving wife, Karen. She was an incredible, progressive woman who gave everything for our family.Bud was a member of the B.P.O.E. #1622 Easton Elks Lodge, The Board, Miles River Yacht Club, Christ Church Easton, and numerous local organizations.Bud is survived by his loving family, sons Earle \"Roo\" B. Wood III and Christopher C. Wood, granddaughters Caroline Wood and Collette Wood, sister Ellen Wood Walmsley (Bill), and sisters-in law Sandy Wood and Nancy Wood.The son of the late Earle \"Pete\" B. Wood and late Frances M. Wood, Bud is predeceased by his wife Karen J. Wood, daughter Melissa M.Wood, grandson Earle \"Peter\" B. Wood IV, sister Suzanne Wood Turner, and brothers Walter Donald Wood and Marvin \"Larry\" Lawrence Wood.We look forward to being with you at the memorial service for Bud. It will be held on Friday, September 22, 2023, beginning at 11 a.m. in Christ Church Easton (111 S. Harrison Street).Casual dress please, no sports coats (Bud's typical uniform: blue Oxford shirt and khakis preferred). In honor of Bud, please consider donating to the local charity of your choosing or the Prader-Willi Syndrome Association (www. pwsausa.org). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Her family is deeply saddened by her sudden loss.Born on April 1, 1954, in urban Baltimore, her family moved to the scenic town of Cambridge, MD in 1962 and were captivated by the beauty of the Choptank River. Sandy attended Cambridge High School and soon after married and later happily divorced Lyle Cameron Sr., remaining amicable. She often joked that her three children were that union's greatest gift. Displaced from homemaking, like many women of her time she persevered, working at Black and Decker, Airpax, and in the hospitality industry. She also married a second time; she made it clear that his name does not merit mention in her story.Sandy was strong-willed, but also possessed immense empathy-traits that helped her though life's many challenges. She approached life with a caring and loyal spirit, leaving lasting impressions on those fortunate enough to cross her path. She loved the beach, vacations and time spent with her children and grandkids. Among her treasured memories were her childhood days spent fishing outside the Cambridge Yacht Club where her love for the water was born, and her final wish was to return to those beloved waters.In her moments of relaxation, Sandy found solace in the pages of books, immersing herself in different worlds. True crime TV shows were a guilty pleasure, and she cherished the weekends spent with her family and friends. Sandy's heart overflowed with love not only for people but also for animals. Her furry companions, both canine and feline, held a special place within her and she was as passionate about helping animals in need as she was people.Sandy is survived by her children, Donise Cameron Dukes (Greg Dukes), Sherry Cameron Adibi (Clyde Adibi), and Lyle Lewis Cameron Jr. (Dayniese Hurley) Her grandchildren, Serena Grace Bloodsworth, Violet Grace Dukes, Iris June Dukes, Joseph Koby Cameron, Scotlund Bayne Cameron, Sebastian Willey, and great-grandson Elijah Willey. She is also survived by her sisters, BJ Brown, Marion Badger, Peggy Andrews, and her brothers, John Badger and Levin Badger.A celebration of Sandy's life is planned for the 30th of September at the Cambridge Yacht Club at 1 Mill Street in Cambridge, MD, from 12 pm to 3 pm. At half past noon, a memorial service will commence. Fellowship and libations shall follow thereafter. Interment will be private.In lieu of floral arrangements, contributions may also be made to the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in tribute to Sandy's compassionate and selfless nature. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was 70 years old.\"Roger was a very good friend,\" said Caroline County Commission Vice President Larry Porter, who succeeded Layton on the commission in 2010. \"He was always very kind with his time and with his advice.\"The county flag was flown at half-staff in Layton's memory.Layton served as vice president of the commission from 2002 to 2010 and was a member of the Caroline County Board of Health during his tenure. He served on the MidShore Regional Council from 2003 to 2010 and the Caroline County Planning Commission from 2007 to 2010. He was past chair of the county Board of Estimates.The county flag was flown at half-staff in Layton's memory.\"I can't tell you how many conversations we had about things, and he would give me his perspective on issues,\" Porter said. \"He was a very, very good source of information and advice, and his advice was always very good.\"Although he didn't know Layton well, Commission President Travis Breeding said he appreciated Layton's backing in the 2022 election.\"He was a supporter of mine and made sure he reached out to me and wanted a sign to put up,\" he said. \"I heard nothing but good things about him, and obviously I have a newfound respect for his public service and the amount of time and dedication\" he devoted, especially during a \"second round of public service that he did as a commissioner.\"According to Layton's obituary, \"Roger's sense of duty and commitment to public service led him to the Maryland State Police Academy, where he graduated in March 1975.\"He was a Maryland State trooper until his retirement in 1997 and served at barracks in Centreville, Denton, Easton, Annapolis and Salisbury.From 1997 to 2002, Layton was an investigator for the Caroline County State's Attorney Office.Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker met Layton when Layton was still a state trooper. They went on to become friends and neighbors.\"Roger was absolutely a great guy,\" Baker said. \"He was a great friend and a great mentor to me, and he will be deeply missed.\"Born Aug. 5, 1953, in Baltimore, Layton was the son of the late Robert Cosden and the late Reva Pauline Sard. He graduated in 1972 from Easton High School.\"He played a pivotal role in shaping the future of his county,\" his obituary stated. \"His dedication to his community was a testament to his love for Denton and the surrounding areas.\"Layton was known for his love of the outdoors, finding \"solace and joy in hunting, fishing, and (excelling) in the art of trap shooting,\" his obituary stated.\"He was an avid fisherman and hunter,\" Breeding said. \"I know firsthand after taking this position, my fishing and hunting time has suffered, so there are a lot of sacrifices that Roger made to (serve) and then to run for office a second time. It really says a lot about his dedication to the community and Caroline County.\"Roger devoted his time to coaching Denton Little League softball for many years and later coached in a women's softball league in Centreville.Breeding recalls a time when he was coaching with American Legion baseball and some equipment got misplaced.\"Roger went out of his way to make sure I got it back,\" he said. \"He was always looking out for people. He was a good guy.\"In January 2006, Layton was critically injured in a fire that destroyed his home near Denton. A news report after the fire quoted then Commission President John Cole. \"I have found Roger to be a man of incredible inner strength,\" he said. \"Trusted friends with strength and dedication are hard to find.\"Layton is survived by his wife Faye Layton of Denton, his daughter Jaclyn Crawford (Chris) of Preston, his granddaughter Madison Weston of Denton, his stepfather Ronald Sard, his sister Rena Callahan (Bobby) of Harmony, his brother Duane Sard (Michael Anne) of Cordova; his uncle Emory Davis of Easton, his cousin Richard Davis (Kim) of Easton, his former son-in-law Mike Weston of Crapo and many nieces and nephews.In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his sister Debbie Cosden; three brothers, Michael Cosden, James H.

Our family will miss him. But I know he's in a better place,\" Ronald Isley said in a statement released Thursday by an Isley Brothers publicist.Further details were not immediately available.A Cincinnati native, Rudolph Isley began singing in church with brothers Ronald and O'Kelly (another sibling, Vernon, died at age 13) and was still in his teens when they broke through in the late 1950s with \"Shout,\" a secularized gospel rave that was later immortalized during the toga party scene in \"Animal House.\" The Isleys scored again in the early 1960s with the equally spirited \"Twist and Shout,\" which the Beatles liked so much they used it as the closing song on their debut album and opened with it for their famed 1965 concert at Shea Stadium.The Isleys' other hits included \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You),\" later covered by Rod Stewart, and the Grammy-winning \"It's Your Thing.\" In the 1970s, after younger brother Ernest and Marvin joined the group, they had even greater success with such singles as \"That Lady\" and \"Fight the Power (Part 1)\" and such million-selling albums as \"The Heat Is On\" and \"Go for Your Guns.\" Rudolph Isley left the group in 1989, three years after the sudden death of O'Kelly Isley, to become a Christian minister. He was among the Isleys inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He was predeceased by his wife of nearly 70 years, Betty Seymour, and by his son, Reverend David Seymour. He is survived by his son, Chris Seymour, and by extended family and his many friends. He was almost 97 years old.George was born November 4, 1926 in St.Michaels, Maryland, the only child of George Albert Seymour Sr. and Thelma Krill Seymour.He attended public schools in St. Michaels and in Baltimore, and then joined the army in the closing days of World War II. He served as a sergeant in the US Army Air Corps, 1st Recon Squadron, 8th Air Force, at Kadena, Okinawa, from1945 to 1946, first as an aviation mechanic, then in the Information and Education Office, where he edited a newspaper called \"Recon Roundup,\" managed the radio station, KRW, and originated and led island history tours for squadron personnel.Returning to civilian life, George graduated cum laude with a BA in Literature from Western Maryland College in 1950, and then earned a Master of Social Work from the University of Pennsylvania in 1952. The same year, he married Betty Radcliffe, a nurse, also from St.Michaels. Their first son, David, was born in 1955, followed ten and a half months later by Chris. The family lived in Baltimore and Annapolis through the end of the 1960s, moving frequently within that area so that Dave could attend schools suited to his cerebral palsy, before returning to St. Michaels in 1971.Professionally, George served 37 years in various public and private non-profit programs in mental health, juvenile delinquency services, and other services for children. He was the Executive Director of Big Brothers of Baltimore for nine years and of Big Brothers of the National Capital Area for two years. He retired as Chief of Social Work at Eastern Shore Hospital Center, at Cambridge, Maryland, in 1987. He spent his retirement with Betty sailing, traveling, and volunteering. George served as a member of the Maryland State Board of Social Work Examiners for three years and as its chairman for one year. He was the co-founder and first president of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of the Upper Eastern Shore, and he volunteered in a variety of capacities for the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, the Talbot County Historical Society, and the St. Michaels Museum at St. Mary's Square.George not only developed the popular walking tour of sites in St. Michaels related to Frederick Douglass, he was also part of the committee that arranged for the statue of Frederick Douglas now in Easton, and he was the driving force behind the successful effort to dedicate State Route 33 to Frederick Douglass.Over the years, George earned multiple honors, including Social Worker of the Year for 1987; the Heritage Initiative Award, in 2011, for his work on Frederick Douglass' legacy; and, with Betty, the Heritage Award, in 2012, for \"lifetime achievement in research and documentation of local history and volunteerism.\" This past spring, he was able to attend the dedication of the George and Betty Seymour Room at the St. Michael's Museum. Though by then of failing health, he spent the day flirting with the docents and promising to come help at the museum if they should need anything.George did not talk very much-he was convinced that Betty was better at talking than hebut when he did speak in the last few years of his long life, his concerns were for Betty's safety and happiness and that his family be able to enjoy his legacy to them, the beautiful house on the river. He did what he had to do to make all that happen. Also, he wanted a beer and some bacon. We made that happen for him.Services will be held at Framptom Funeral Home, Ostrowski Chapel, 312 S. Talbot Street, in St. Michaels at 11 AM, Saturday, November 4th. Interment will be at Olivet Cemetery.

Her passing was peaceful as she was comforted and held by her youngest daughter, Anne.Ruth was born on August 21st, 1928, to Annie Elmira Eckert and Nevin Emanuel Dietrich in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania. Ruth loved and cherished her sister, Agnes Breidegam and her three brothers, Ivan, Ray, and Lloyd Dietrich, who preceded her in death.After graduating from high school, Ruth attended Mansfield State Teacher's College, in Pennsylvania. A devoted student, Ruth, earned a BA in Education, with French as her minor.She completed a graduate degree at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.She was a believer in attaining education and she so enjoyed learning, especially foreign languages.She was fluent in German and French.Ruth was a teacher for several years in New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania.Ruth married the late Hubert Chester Santucci on August 22,1953, in Hershey, Pennsylvania.Upon their move to Easton, Maryland, Ruth continued teaching for several more years at St. Michaels High School. Following the births of her daughters, she focused on raising her children and supporting her husband, Hubert, as he continued his employment as principal of Easton High School, and later as Supervisor of Instruction at the Talbot County School Board.Ruth was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. She always said she would \"fight tigers for her daughters\". She was a nurturer, a protector, and provided calm council for her family. As her husband's health declined, she was his strength. A quiet sentinel at his casket, gently placing his sleep toboggan on his head, so he wouldn't feel cold. A calm enduring presence following his death to give comfort to all the family who were grieving.Ruth was of the Depression Era. She never asked for much and was content with what she did have. She always put others feelings ahead of her own and it was most important for her to conduct herself in a ladylike manner. She never wanted to cause distress or inconvenience for anyone. A resilient lady, calm in a crisis, always lending emotional support to others.A member of St. Peter and Paul Catholic Church, Ruth had a strong faith. She did not fear death. She was confident she would be surrounded by her loved ones when she passed.Ruth is survived by her daughters, Lisa Santucci Dunphy, Amy Santucci Parrish, and Anne Kay Santucci; granddaughter, Kathryn Taylor Raver and her husband, Adam; grandson, William Chester Parrish, and his wife, Arianne; her great-grandchildren James Hubert Raver and Peyton Louis Raver; her sons-in-law, John Dunphy and Randy Parrish. Ruth will be cremated and her remains will be buried with her cherished husband, Hubert Chester Santucci, at the Eastern Shore Veteran's Cemetery.As Ruth had a love of learning and teaching, in lieu of flowers, she would have appreciated a donation to the Talbot County Free Library of Easton, Maryland. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Henry Kissinger, former secretary of state, dies at 100\n\n November 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 676\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the diplomat with the thick glasses and gravelly voice who dominated foreign policy as the United States extricated itself from Vietnam and broke down barriers with China, died Wednesday, his consulting firm said.He was 100.With his gruff yet commanding presence and behind-the-scenes manipulation of power, Kissinger exerted uncommon influence on global affairs under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, earning both vilification and the Nobel Peace Prize.Decades later, his name still provoked impassioned debate over foreign policy landmarks long past.Kissinger's power grew during the turmoil of Watergate, when the politically attuned diplomat assumed a role akin to co-president to the weakened Nixon.\"No doubt my vanity was piqued,\" Kissinger later wrote of his expanding influence. \"But the dominant emotion was a premonition of catastrophe.\"A Jewish man who fled Nazi Germany with his family in his teens, Kissinger in his later years cultivated the reputation of respected statesman, giving speeches, offering advice to Republicans and Democrats alike and managing a global consulting business.For eight restless years - first as national security adviser, later as secretary of state, and for a time in the middle holding both titles - Kissinger ranged across the breadth of major foreign policy issues. He conducted the first \"shuttle diplomacy\" in the quest for Middle East peace. He used secret channels to pursue ties between the United States and China, ending decades of isolation and mutual hostility.He initiated the Paris negotiations that ultimately provided a face-saving means - a \"decent interval,\" he called it - to get the United States out of a costly war in Vietnam. Two years later, Saigon fell to the communists.And he pursued a policy of detente with the Soviet Union that led to arms control agreements and raised the possibility that the tensions of the Cold War and its nuclear threat did not have to last forever.At age 99, he was still out on tour for his book on leadership. Asked in July 2022 interview with ABC whether he wished he could take back any of his decisions, Kissinger demurred, saying: \"I've been thinking about these problems all my life. It's my hobby as well as my occupation. And so the recommendations I made were the best of which I was then capable.\"Kissinger was a practitioner of realpolitik - using diplomacy to achieve practical objectives rather than advance lofty ideals. Supporters said his pragmatic bent served U.S. interests; critics saw a Machiavellian approach that ran counter to democratic ideals.He was castigated for authorizing telephone wiretaps of reporters and his own National Security Council staff to plug news leaks in Nixon's White House.He was denounced on college campuses for the bombing and allied invasion of Cambodia in April 1970, intended to destroy North Vietnamese supply lines to communist forces in South Vietnam.That \"incursion,\" as Nixon and Kissinger called it, was blamed by some for contributing to Cambodia's fall into the hands of Khmer Rouge insurgents who later slaughtered some 2 million Cambodians.Pudgy and messy, Kissinger incongruously acquired a reputation as a ladies' man in the staid Nixon administration.Kissinger, who had divorced his first wife in 1964, called women \"a diversion, a hobby.\" Jill St. John was a frequent companion.But it turned out his real love interest was Nancy Maginnes, a researcher for Nelson Rockefeller whom he married in 1974.Yet Kissinger was reviled by many Americans for his conduct of wartime diplomacy.He was still a lightning rod decades later: In 2015, an appearance by the 91-year-old Kissinger before the Senate Armed Services Committee was disrupted by protesters demanding his arrest for war crimes and calling out his actions in Southeast Asia, Chile and beyond.Heinz Alfred Kissinger was born in the Bavarian city of Fuerth on May 27, 1923, the son of a schoolteacher.His family left Nazi Germany in 1938 and settled in Manhattan, where Heinz changed his name to Henry.Kissinger had two children, Elizabeth and David, from his first marriage. \n \n Caption: Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger speaks during a meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, Oct. 10, 2017, in Washington. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Born in Ludlow, Vermont on December 28th, 1940 to Toivo Ekroos and Jesse McMurtry Ekroos. He had five siblings: Toivo \"Ted\" Ekroos, Ralph Ekroos, William \"Bill\" Ekroos, Joseph \"Joe\" Ekroos and his sister Helen Counter Ekroos.He is survived by: His wife of 56 years, Mary Lois (Egeli) Ekroos, of Trappe, MD, daughter April Ekroos Carr, of Cambridge, MD, son Jon Raymond Ekroos, and grandchildren Ethan Ekroos, Alexandra (Lexi) Ekroos and Jackson Ekroos of Easton, MD; son Jeffrey S. Owen and wife Amy Owen and grandchildren Justin Owen and Jacob Owen, of Brandon VT.Ray was a longtime friend of Bill W., celebrating nearly 42 years. He made a career of helping others as an Addictions Counselor at the Talbot County Health Department's Addictions Program. He was a man who lived with simple and honest principals. He lived one day at a time and in each day, he would extract as much joy and exhilaration out of life as he possibly could, \"Today is a great day to be alive\" being a favorite quote of his.Ray enjoyed many hobbies including traveling, riding his motorcycle, playing pool, fishing, shopping, sailing, and car shows. He often could be seen in his small red 1983 convertible Porche Carrera with his infamous vanity tag. He especially enjoyed trips to his birth state of Vermont, riding his motorcycle through the mountain's backroads with his wife on the back.Ray is sorely missed and will live on in his family's hearts and through the community with all the lives he touched and impacted. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Here are memories of some of them.Matthew Perry: It's almost impossible to grasp any of the six \"Friends\" being absent now, but that happened with the passing of the actor who fit the part of witty, acerbic Chandler Bing like a glove.\nNorman Lear: A much-celebrated master of socially relevant comedy, his work will live on in classic series from \"All in the Family\" to \"One Day at a Time.\"\nSuzanne Somers: Thanks to this actress, the lovably daft Chrissy Snow became one of the most popular female characters in sitcom history on \"Three's Company.\"\nCindy Williams: Thanks to the half of the team she upheld, \"Laverne & Shirley\" boasted one of TV comedy's all-time-top duos.\nDavid McCallum: Years after he was a pop-culture sensation as spy Illya Kuryakin on \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\" McCallum gained another audience as Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard on the globally popular \"NCIS.\"\nRichard Belzer: This actor and comic's portrayal of Detective John Munch on \"Homicide: Life on the Street\" proved impactful enough to be transferred into \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\"\nBob Barker: Though Bill Cullen hosted the original \"The Price Is Right,\" the personable Barker made the game show his own - and for many years - when he began hosting a revival in 1972.\nLen Goodman: The lovably fussy judge always enlivened \"Dancing With the Stars.\"\nPaul Reubens: In his distinctive persona as Pee-wee Herman, this comedic actor made a major contribution to the field of family programming with \"Pee-wee's Playhouse.\"\nTony Bennett: One of popular music's most enduring talents made regular TV appearances, up to his specials with Lady Gaga in the twilight of his career.\nHarry Belafonte: Among the many pursuits by this icon of entertainment and civil rights were acclaimed TV specials, some done in tandem with such other stars as Julie Andrews and Lena Horne.\nRichard Moll: The tall actor who embodied the role of bailiff Bull was one of the reasons for the success of the original \"Night Court.\"\nRon Cephas Jones: This excellent actor's moving portrayal of Randall's (Sterling K. Brown) father William on \"This Is Us\" earned him two Primetime Emmy Awards.\nTreat Williams: This prolific actor had notable series runs on \"Everwood\" and \"Chesapeake Shores,\" and recurring stints on such hits as \"Chicago Fire\" and \"Blue Bloods.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Thornton II passed away on December 12, 2023 surrounded by his family following a brief illness.Charlie, a worldrenowned structural engineer, and the founder of Thornton Tomasetti started the ACE Mentor Program in 1994, when he saw a decline in engineering enrollment at his alma mater, Manhattan College. His belief in the transformative power of education and mentoring took ACE Mentor from a single team of students in New York City to over 10,000 students a year across 70+ metro areas today. ACE Mentor Programs spread so quickly because of Charlie's intense passion for its cause.\nCharlie worked with many of the most talented architects of the day and his firm amassed a portfolio of high-rise buildings, airports, sports and entertainment venues, transportation hubs and special and long-span structures, many of which have set industry standards for innovative thinking. These include some of the first supertall towers-Petronas Towers in Malaysia and Taipei 101 in Taiwan-and countless iconic structures around the world.\nBetween his pioneering work in structural engineering, which reshaped skylines and set new standards for innovation in the built environment, to his commitment to nurturing the next generation of professionals, Charlie's impact on this world is immeasurable.\nCharlie Thornton, the proud son of a bricklayer, went on to earn his Ph.D. in Structural Engineering from NYU. He leaves behind a legacy of innovation, education, and mentorship that will endure for generations. As we mourn his loss, let us also celebrate the extraordinary life of a man whose passion and vision continue to shape our lives today.\nCharlie is predeceased by his parents Charles, Sr and Evelyn. He is survived by his wife Carolyn, his daughters Diana, Kathy (Brian), Becky, and his son Charles III (Kathleen), his grandchildren Ryan (Jackie), Kaitlin (Shawn), Casey, Andrew, Brandon (Emma), Meghan (Nate), and Charles IV, and two great-grandchildren.\nHe is also survived by his brothers William (Joan) and Robert (Gerry).\nDetails regarding memorial services will be shared with friends, family, and colleagues in the coming days.

    "content": "Ellie W. Taylor\n\n December 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 6 | Section: Obituaries \n \n 638\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n NEWBURYPORT, MA - Ellie Taylor died peacefully December 19, 2023, after a long battle with dementia. Ellie was born Eleanor Merryman Ward on April 6, 1940, to Nathaniel and Eleanor Ward of Baltimore, MD, but she grew up in Greensboro, NC and was very much \"Ellie\" from her earliest years. She spent summers as a young girl in Blowing Rock, NC, learning to ride and love horses. She attended The Madeira School in McLean, VA, where she formed friendships that were a source of support, joy and love throughout her life, and studied at Duke University before marrying and starting a family. Ellie was an incredibly strong woman who always put others first. She was a wonderful and devoted mother of three, and a trusted friend who could always be counted on to remember every birthday and anniversary and to know how to acknowledge whatever the occasion in the most thoughtful and perfectly appropriate manner.She spent many years caring for loved ones in need, first as primary caregiver to her daughter Gina throughout her 8-year battle with cancer, and then as caregiver to her former husband John Taylor, who was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease.\nWhen she wasn't caring for others - and even while she was - Ellie was often busy volunteering or working.\nAs a young mother in Charlotte, NC, in the 1970s she was an advocate for women's rights and worked with grassroots organizations to help revitalize Uptown Charlotte. After moving to Oxford, MD, she worked in the family boatyard and as a buyer for a local fine clothing store. She later relocated to Washington, DC, where she studied Russian history and art to become a docent at the Hillwood Museum.\nFinally, after returning to Maryland's Eastern Shore, she became a certified personal trainer and developed a loyal (and fit!) following among her clients at Body Watts Fitness Studio in Easton, MD. She very much enjoyed living on the tributaries that feed the Chesapeake Bay, but undeniably preferred her dogs to boats. In caring for her former husband and then with her own diagnosis, Ellie fought a courageous and stoic battle against the pain and loss that goes along with dementia. She eventually found peace and was extremely grateful for her dear friends and members of her community even as her memories faded and reorganized themselves. She was a welcome force of positive energy and brought joy to her fellow residents and the wonderful staff at Avita of Newburyport, where she spent her final years enveloped in love. Throughout it all, Ellie drew strength and purpose from the words of Ms. Madeira, founder of The Madeira School: \"Function in disaster, finish in style.\" Indeed, she did both, and in so doing made the world a better place. She was kind and generous, and was loved by all who were fortunate enough to know her. Ellie is survived by two of her three children from her first marriage to Philip Conner: daughter Lisa and son-in-law David Sweet of Rye, NH, and son Philip (Jr) and daughter-in-law Laura Conner of West Hartford, CT. She was preceded in death by her eldest daughter Gina in 1988. Her legacy is also alive and well in her four grandchildren, Ella, Sam and Nate Sweet and Zach Conner. While her journey was difficult, her family would like to thank the many friends, caregivers and more than a couple strangers who provided support, comfort and guidance along the way, helping Ellie to navigate her decline with dignity and a high quality of life. A celebration of her life will be held for family and friends in the spring.\nMemorial donations can be made to Shining Hope Farms (https://shininghopefarms.org/).\nTo view Ellie's Online Tribute, send condolences to the family, or for more information, visit www.csnh.com.\nAssisting the family with arrangements is the Cremation Society of NH, Manchester. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jean found some hospital documents that said the 17th. So, let's just say she was born around midnight. Jean moved with her family to Denton, MD when she was one.\nAs a child, Jean believed if you opened a tube of Pillsbury rolls, the Doughboy would pop out.\nShe opened many tubes and Mom got her an official Doughboy toy. The first in her massive collection of Doughboys. Jean was a fan of Barry Manilow. One of her happiest days was when she won his new album by being the correct caller to the radio station. Jean was active in 4-H as a child.\nJean graduated from North Caroline High School in 1979. She won the Home Economics Award for her sewing skills. She went to Hagerstown Business School to learn clerical skills.

She died December 15, 2023 at age 93. Margaret was born in Pierre, South Dakota in 1930, one of four siblings growing up in the Great Depression. She graduated from Pierre High School, Cottey College, University of Minnesota, and Johns Hopkins School of Nursing.She worked in the Johns Hopkins neonatal unit and met Robert Trever during his medical residency. The couple married in 1954 and moved to Easton, Maryland in 1958. Her husband's solo medical practice, which served generations of patients on the Delmarva, would have been impossible without her.\nThroughout her life, Margaret prioritized giving back to the community. Her numerous causes included the Neighborhood Center, Talbot Library, YMCA, and United Way.\nHer volunteer roles included tutor, lifeguard, and swim instructor. An outspoken believer in education, she was honored to serve a term on the Talbot County School Board and was a life-long learner herself. She was also an active member of St. Mark's Methodist congregation in Easton and enjoyed multi-faith worship services.\nAfter her husband was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in his late 70s, she supported his ability to stay in the family home and exercise on the Easton Rails-to-Trails with their dog Jak until Robert's death in 2013.\nHer 7 children, 6 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren survive her. We are thankful for the support and care she received in her final years from family members, friends, medical, hospice, and other care staff.\nIn lieu of flowers, please donate to a charity of your choice, or perform an act of kindness or community service in Margaret's honor.\nAn expanded obituary is available at: https://www.wrmcdonaldfuneralhome.com/obituaries/. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "K. Diane Baumgartner\n\n January 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 6 | Section: Obituaries \n \n 910\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS - K. Diane Baumgartner, a beacon of light whose vibrant spirit danced through the currents of life, passed away surrounded by the love of her husband and children on November 9, 2023. Born on September 30, 1949, to John Walter Baumgartner and Anna Elizabeth Bell, Diane grew up on a family farm before moving to Vienna, MD where she embraced every aspect of life with an adventurous and joyful heart, spending many of her days at her grandmothers' home playing the piano.Diane's passion for movement brought her and Edward Farley together through the rhythmic steps of contra dancing in 2004. Their souls intertwined, leading to a seaside wedding in Florida on February 29, 2008. As partners in life, they sailed through the ebbs and flows, dancing along many shores and anchored their lives not far from the water's edge in St. Michaels, MD.\nDiane, a devoted mother, shared her boundless love with her children Michael Hawkins, Ashley Dejter, Alex Hawkins, and Nick Hawkins, whose lives she shaped alongside Chester Hawkins. Her nurturing heart extended to her eldest grandson Maison Hawkins, whom she raised for 12 years. Affectionately known as 'Mom-mom,' she enveloped her grandchildren Ethan Hawkins, Cru Dejter, Eleanora Hawkins, Wade Dejter, Nolan Hawkins, Axel Hawkins, Beau Hawkins, and Ezra Hawkins in the warmth of her love, as vast and embracing as the ocean itself.\nDiane's siblings - Nancy Reid, John Baumgartner, Don 'Bumpy' Baumgartner, and Betty Anne 'Bee' Harding- were her close friends in life's journey. Together with Bee, they raised their children side by side, their laughter echoing through countless ocean vacations.\nHer essence was one of acceptance and empathy, a sanctuary for others, offering a peace that calmed the worries of many. Her children recall a home where anger was a stranger, and life's lessons were learned through living rather than lecturing. Diane's intuitive nature and presence made you feel like the center of her universe, a feeling cherished by all who knew her.\nDiane's diverse professional endeavors, spanning three distinct careers, were a unified expression of her deep exploration into various cultural practices of healing the human body.\nHer first act was as a dancer, gracing stages with performances that captured the hearts of audiences and the praise of critics. A graduate of the University of Maryland, she earned her Bachelor of Arts in Dance in 1971, and subsequently, her Master of Arts from the University of Illinois in 1973. Diane's fervor for dance propelled her into the roles of instructor and choreographer at renowned institutions, including her tenure as a dance instructor at Sweet Briar College from 1976 to 1978, an artist in residence at Towson State in 1979, and an assistant professor of dance at Goucher College from 1979 to 1982.\nHer dedication to the arts continued as she choreographed and taught modern and jazz at the Baltimore School for the Arts, the University of Maryland, and the Peabody Conservatory from 1982 to 1984, leaving an indelible mark on the dance community.\nWhen motherhood called, Diane embraced it fully, only to reemerge in her second act as a nurturing nurse. After obtaining her Bachelor of Arts in Nursing from Stevenson University and her Master's from Wesley College, Diane's impact as a nurse was profound and far-reaching.\nKnown endearingly as 'Mrs. B' by the hundreds of students she mentored, Diane's legacy at Anne Arundel Community College and Chesapeake College is measured not just in the over 500 nursing students she educated, but in the countless lives they went on to touch. Her tenure there, which spanned a significant part of her career, was marked by the heartfelt support and unwavering belief she instilled in her students. Beyond her teaching, Diane brought an innovative spirit to Anne Arundel Hospital, where she introduced and developed a Reiki program, weaving her knowledge of holistic practices into the fabric of patient care, thereby enhancing the healing process with the energy and empathy that were the hallmarks of her life's work.\nDiane's zest for life found its zenith in her sixties as she embraced the role of a certified yoga instructor which was not just a pursuit of personal well-being, but an extension of her lifelong commitment to nurturing others. With her characteristic enthusiasm, Diane traversed the world, seeking further certifications and deepening her practice amidst the serenity of these paradises. At the Talbot County Senior Center, she offered her expertise often without charge, making the transformative power of yoga accessible to her community. Her teaching extended to the sandy shores of OBX and Myrtle Beach, where family vacations were graced with her leading yoga sessions against the backdrop of the ocean-a place she felt most at peace.\nThese sessions were more than mere exercises; they were the confluence of Diane's love for the water, her passion for teaching, and her innate ability to bring calm and balance into the lives of those around her, leaving a legacy for her family and community.\nDiane's life was a celebration, a dance of joy, love, and compassion. As we bid her farewell, we invite you to share in a celebration of her life, honoring a soul that moved gracefully through this world, leaving behind a legacy of love and cherished memories.\nCelebration of Life Service: January 7, 2024 3 PM at Living Waters Assembly in Denton, Md In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Living Waters Assembly, 9058 Double Hills Rd, Denton, MD 21629 \"May the waves carry you home, and the dance never end.\"\nFor online condolences, visit www.fhnfuneralhome.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Farming and fair communities remember the late F. Grove Miller\n\n March 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton & Jane Bellmyer cahamilton@cecilwhig.com | Section: News \n \n 1500\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The name F. Grove Miller Jr. is synonymous with the Cecil County Fair or, from a more conservative standpoint, it is at least forever intertwined with that annual Fair Hill summer event that spans nine days and attracts more than 75,000 people.Undeniably, the Cecil County Fair is high on the long list of achievements and community contributions of Miller, who died on Monday at Christiana Care's Union Hospital in Elkton after a brief illness. Miller was 96.\n\"He is one of the reasons we have the Cecil County Fair,\" said Wayne Stafford, whose 120-acre beef and crops home farm in Calvert is about one mile away from the 350-acre dairy farm to which Miller, his ancestors and predecessors have been connected to as owners and workers for seven generations.\nDon Moore, 60, has lived and worked on his family's three-generation farm, which is next to the Miller's farm, all of his life, and he, too, credited Miller for playing a major role in creating and developing the annual Cecil County Fair.\n\"He was among a handful of local farmers who saw a need to have this kind of community event,\" commented Moore, who described Miller as \"easygoing\" and a \"wonderful neighbor.\"\nMiller was approximately 25 years old in 1953, when he and four other farmers representing the Calvert, Cecilton and Colora Granges met to discuss the possibility of holding an annual Cecil County Fair. (The other four farmers, all of whom have since passed away, are Robert Carrion, Bill Groff, Walt Mason and and Ray Mueller, who was Cecil County's Agricultural Extension Agent at the time.)\nMiller and his four fellow farmers founded the Cecil County Fair Board and that group, looking for a suitable place to hold the annual event, approached the late William DuPont, who owned the 5,400-acre parcel known today as Fair Hill Natural Resources Management Area.\nDuPont welcomed and supported the idea, so much so that he shared the expense of the fledgling Cecil County Fair throughout its first years and even donated a grandstand and several outbuildings for displays and livestock.\nThe first Cecil County Fair was held on a portion of that Fair Hill property on July 31,1954. It was a one-day event, running from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., and admission was free. Approximately 750 people attended that inaugural Cecil County Fair.\nToday, more than 75,000 people attend the annual Cecil County Fair, which lasts nine days, and there are over 7,000 entries from about 1,200 open and 4-H exhibitors.\nMiller served on the Cecil County Fair Board for 24 years, stepping down in 1978, when he was replaced by one his two sons, Al Miller, who was about 24 then. Working in similar fashion on an even grander scale, Miller left to join the Maryland State Fair Board, on which he served the next 40 years as chairman. At age 90, Miller stepped down from the Maryland State Fair Board in December 2017. In full-circle fashion, Robbie Miller, who is Miller's 36-year-old grandson, now serves on the Maryland State Fair Board.\nMiller once wrote an essay of sorts regarding his philosophy when it comes to community fairs. Considering that the Cecil County Fair is a great part of his legacy, these words written by him are profound:\n\"First and foremost, fairs are about families, young and old coming together to participate in or enjoy watching competitions and exhibitions. When I see grandparents taking their grandchildren around the Fair, I say, 'Now, that's what the Fair is all about'…older generations passing on what they have learned to future generations and younger generations proudly sharing their new skills with the older generation.\"\n'A PASSION FOR AGRICULTURE'\nMiller's resume reflects how he volunteered a wealth of his time for decades to numerous other boards and groups, including the University of Maryland Board of Regents, the Maryland 4-H Board, the Maryland Land Preservation Board, the Fair Hill Races Board, on which he served as chairman; the Fair Hill DNR Long Range Plan, also as chairman; the Maryland Farm Bureau, on which he served four years as president; the Cecil County Department of Social Services Board and the Union Hospital Board. He also served on the board for County Bank and Trust/PNC Bank and the Bainbridge Museum Board.\nAl Miller, who lives in Calvert, recalled with a chuckle how a public speaker once commented from the podium, \"If Grove Miller was paid a dollar for every hour he volunteered in Cecil County and throughout Maryland, he would be a millionaire.\"\nMost of his endeavors focused on supporting his fellow farmers. Fittingly, Miller, who is described in his obituary as \"a well-respected farmer in Cecil County,\" was inducted into the Maryland Agricultural Hall of Fame.\n\"He had a passion for agriculture,\" said Stafford, who carpooled with Miller to and from Randallstown for the monthly Maryland Farm Bureau meetings during the later part of the 1970s, which gave him an opportunity to learn from the seasoned farmer, agriculture advocate and community volunteer.\nSon of the late Carl Stafford, another well-known Cecil County farmer, 67-year-old Stafford continued, \"He got to be a mentor for me. Grove was a great mentor. He knew how to advocate governmentally. Many times I went to him for advice.\"\nAlong those lines, Stafford noted, \"Grove is the inspiration I had to pursue an active involvement in the Farm Bureau.\"\nMoore made a similar observation of Miller, commenting, \"He was very active in the community and he was an excellent spokesperson for agriculture and the community as well.\"\nFRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES\nMiller knew and interacted with many people in leadership roles while serving as a point-person, so to speak, for agriculture, as well as for other areas related to the committees and groups on which he volunteered. One of those people was longtime Cecil County resident David Rudolph, who served in the Maryland General Assembly in Annapolis as a state delegate from 1995 to 2015.\n\"Grove Miller was one of the finest gentlemen I have ever had the opportunity to know. He was known throughout the State of Maryland as an individual dedicated to making his county and state a better place. In my opinion and I am sure many Marylanders, he personified the term 'Statesman.' This leadership is especially true at the Maryland State Fair, where his vision and commitment will be felt for generations to come,\" Rudolph said, before remarking, \"I will always be honored to have called him my friend and colleague. This is truly a sad day for all Marylanders.\"\nAl Miller, 70, reported that his father also was close to late Maryland State Senators Walter M. Baker, who served from 1979 to 2003, and Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., who served from 1975 to 2020.\n\"He was deeply connected with Annapolis,\" said Al Miller, who has served as a Cecil County Councilman for the past six years.\nAlong those lines, Miller hosted the late Louis L. Goldstein, who served as Maryland's comptroller from 1959 to 1998, on a tour of the Fair Hill property when it still was owned by the DuPont family, according to Al Miller, who then opined, \"My father was very instrumental in the State of Maryland buying that property.\"\nIn addition to Al Miller, whose wife is Karen, Miller's other surviving children are his other son, Kenneth S. Miller (Kay) of Milton, Del., and daughter, Dianne E. Russell (Bill) of North East. Miller and his wife, Arlene, had been married 70 years when she died in May 2021.\nA GOOD MAN\nD. Andrew Cashman, who has served as Maryland State Fair general manager for many years, worked closely with Miller.\n\"Grove is a man whose name has always been synonymous with fairs and fairness. For more than 50 years, this visionary has provided service to the Cecil County Fair, the Cecil County Breeders Fair, the Maryland State Fair, the MAAFS and the IAFE. He has gained the respect of thousands of people in the fair, 4-H, agriculture and business industries, as well as in the state legislature. He is always willing to share his knowledge, energy and understanding of Maryland fairs, agriculture and politics,\" Cashman summarized.\nCashman noted that Miller proudly served in the U.S. Navy as a medic during World War II and the Korean Conflict.\n\"Miller, who grew up on a farm and was a 4-H member, believed in service to his community and his country. His service was demonstrated early in life when he interrupted his college education for military service. Following his military service, he and his brother (the late Jack Miller) decided to go into dairy farming together,\" he outlined.\nIt is clear that Cashman respected Miller as a volunteer and as a friend.\n\"Grove Miller, best known for his great smile, robust laugh, positive attitude and willingness to work hard, has helped to make the Maryland Fair industry the best,\" Cashman said.\nAl Miller often turned to his father for guidance when making decisions, he said. And the sound advice that his father gave him always reflected wisdom gained through his years of experience, Al Miller added.\nHe described his father this way: \"My dad was my best friend, my mentor and my idol.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Sailing leader and community trailblazer Diana Mautz dies\n\n March 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 629\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Diana Mautz was a tough, brilliant woman.From leading sailing crews to spending time with her two sons, she was known for her compassion, unshaken moral compass and generous acts of service.\nMautz died after several years of critical health complications on Thursday, March 14, according to her family.\n\"She's a loving lady. She always gave back, not for recognition or anything; she gave back from her heart,\" Daniel Mautz, Diana's son, said.\nOriginally from Galion, Ohio, Diana Mautz spent her life making St. Michaels home for her and her family. She led a life of leadership, mentorship and philanthropy.\nHer family and friends described her as an invincible force shaping the St. Michaels Business Association and helping transform the local economy.\nMautz attended Saint Xavier University in Chicago, Illinois, before meeting and then marrying her husband, John Fredrick Mautz.\nShe moved to St. Michaels shortly after the birth of her first son, Johnny Mautz, in 1970, so she could follow her love for sailing. Four years later, she gave birth to her son Daniel.\nMautz built one of the East Coast's most extensive junior sailing programs. She directed junior sailing programs at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, the Tred Avon Yacht Club, the Miles River Yacht Club and what was then known as the Talbot County YMCA.\nJohnny Mautz said his mother's love for sailing and teaching kids to sail was a driving force in her life. He said she instilled a competitive spirit in her students. Many of the kids she taught went on to sail competitively, and some even went on to the Olympics.\nCathy Schmidt, a friend of Mautz's, said they taught sailing side by side for 25 years.\n\"Deep in our hearts, we all wanted our students to love sailing, and silliness was the perfect catalyst,\" Schmidt said. \"Scavenger hunts, 4th of July boat parades, popsicle stick Olympics, candy mark, instructor paddling races, turtle dancing and field trips all over the river too numerous to mention, unlock our inner child when mentioned between old sailing friends. These precious memories are, in a way, Diana's legacy.\"\nIn 1979, unbeknownst to her husband, Diana Mautz purchased Carpenter Street Saloon on C-Street in St. Michaels, which still operates today as one of the remaining iconic Eastern Shore gathering spots.\nWhen Mautz purchased the saloon, it was not a place people considered a shining star, her family said, but she saw potential.\n\"She went in and found the best in everyone,\" Johnny Mautz said. \"They may have been the roughest crowd around in that bar, but they were the sweetest of men and women … All of them had hearts and souls of gold.\"\nDaniel Mautz said his mom transformed the saloon into a calm place. He said her work in the saloon taught her many lessons and helped her grow as a business owner and leader.\nJohnny Mautz recounted how, as a child, witnessing men trying to intimidate her, his mother would just look them right in the eye and not back down.\n\"She did things that most women didn't do,\" he said. \"She had no concern, and she had no fear about saying, 'I'm gonna do this.' I think a lot of the men at the time were a little taken aback by this 'pushy gal,' but she was never pushy. She was assertive, and she was never afraid.\"\nDaniel Mautz said he learned from his mother not to back down from a challenge and to be persistent with his goals.\nHer family said that Mautz found a way to organize, encourage and lead volunteers to meet the community's needs in every place she lived.\nIn lieu of flowers, her family has established a Diana Mautz Legacy Fund. They ask that checks are made payable to Foundation for Community Development Inc. or any other correspondence to address 23942 N. Porters Creek Lane, St. Michaels 21663. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "author": "RICK STEVENS Special to the Star Democrat",
    "content": "Never forget: Greater love hath no man but that a man lay down his life for his friends\n\n May 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RICK STEVENS Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Life \n \n 541\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recently, I attended a family wedding on Maryland's Eastern Shore, staying overnight in the small village of Cambridge.To pass the time between nuptial obligations, I decided to walk around the town. At the corner of Church and High streets, I encountered the Christ Episcopal Church and its accompanying cemetery, which I later learned has served as a burial ground dating to the 1690s. My innate curiosity led me through the iron gates to stroll among the gravestones. I discovered that four former Maryland governors are buried there, along with generations of local parish families.\nTime and weather have rendered many markers nearly illegible, but one stone slab, adorned with an American flag, caught my eye.\nLevin J. Newcomb Jr. was born April 27, 1918. He died June 19, 1944, in Normandy, France. Capt. Newcomb was just 26 years old. His marker records he was a member of Company A, 115 Infantry, 29th Division. It's reasonable to assume Capt. Newcomb was the company commander. The marker is engraved with the crossed rifles of an infantryman and the blue and gray yin and yang patch of the 29th Infantry Division. It includes the scripture, \"Greater love hath no man but that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"\nAt the top are the words, \"IN MEMORY OF,\" a phrase that intrigued me. Why were those words necessary?\nIt turns out Capt. Newcomb's final resting place is actually Plot G, Row 25, Grave 7 in the Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France. He never came home to Dorchester County.\nIt was common in that era for servicemembers to be interred close to where they died. Many families, seeking closure or hoping to create a physical connection to their loved ones, placed tributes in their local cemeteries. Those markers allowed them to share their experience of loss with others in the community and perhaps cope with what must have been nearly intolerable grief.\nThis year marks the 80th anniversary of the Normandy invasion. It's the 80th anniversary of a campaign between June and September of 1944 that saw some 29,000 Americans killed in action.\nToday, it's impossible to know the positive impact the fallen might have had on their families and communities across our nation had they survived the war. Robbed of life's bounties and promise, we'll never know how soldiers like Capt. Newcomb would have contributed to the greater good of society. I imagine him sitting in a pew in Christ Church with his wife, June, and young son, Richard, enjoying tasty Maryland crab at picnics, quietly being a pillar of the community … rarely talking about his experiences in combat.\nBut it was not to be. His brave commitment to a calling greater than himself is his legacy.\nCapt. Levin J. Newcomb Jr., and others like him, are why we pause and reflect each Memorial Day. Understandably, I'd never heard of Capt. Newcomb before my unplanned wandering through that small, timeworn garden of remembrance. Yet, I'm honored to have learned a little more about him while researching this message. More importantly, I'm reminded of our explicit duty to \"never forget\" the contributions of our fallen … wherever they may rest in peace.\nRetired Maj. Gen. Rick Stevens is senior vice president and director of business development at Dawson & Associates. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was 70.\nJohn, who was born in Cambridge, spent the majority of his life in Oxford.

    "content": "Pioneering sex therapist Westheimer dies at 96\n\n July 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: National \n \n 1402\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n NEW YORK — Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the diminutive sex therapist who became a pop icon, media star and best-selling author through her frank talk about once-taboo bedroom topics, has died. She was 96.Westheimer died on Friday at her home in New York City, surrounded by her family, according to publicist and friend Pierre Lehu.\nWestheimer never advocated risky sexual behavior. Instead, she encouraged an open dialogue on previously closeted issues that affected her audience of millions. Her one recurring theme was there was nothing to be ashamed of.\n\"I still hold old-fashioned values and I'm a bit of a square,\" she told students at Michigan City High School in 2002. \"Sex is a private art and a private matter. But still, it is a subject we must talk about.\"\nWestheimer's giggly, German-accented voice, coupled with her 4-foot-7 frame, made her an unlikely looking — and sounding — outlet for \"sexual literacy.\" The contradiction was one of the keys to her success.\nBut it was her extensive knowledge and training, coupled with her humorous, nonjudgmental manner, that catapulted her local radio program, \"Sexually Speaking,\" into the national spotlight in the early 1980s. She had an open approach to what two consenting adults did in the privacy of their home.\n\"Tell him you're not going to initiate,\" she told a concerned caller in June 1982. \"Tell him that Dr. Westheimer said that you're not going to die if he doesn't have sex for one week.\"\nAs a sign of her appeal across the generations and social culture, tributes came from actor-comedian Adam Sandler — \"She always made us smile,\" he wrote on X — to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who appointed Westheimer the state's Ambassador of Loneliness. \"May her memory be a blessing,\" said the governor in a statement. \"She was brave, funny, candid and brilliant.\"\nHer radio success opened new doors, and in 1983 she wrote the first of more than 40 books: \"Dr. Ruth's Guide to Good Sex,\" demystifying sex with both rationality and humor. There was even a board game, Dr. Ruth's Game of Good Sex.\nShe soon became a regular on the late-night television talk-show circuit, bringing her personality to the national stage. Her rise coincided with the early days of the AIDS epidemic, when frank sexual talk became a necessity.\n\"If we could bring about talking about sexual activity the way we talk about diet — the way we talk about food — without it having this kind of connotation that there's something not right about it, then we would be a step further. But we have to do it with good taste,\" she told Johnny Carson in 1982.\nShe normalized the use of words like \"penis\" and \"vagina\" on radio and TV, aided by her Jewish grandmotherly accent, which The Wall Street Journal once said was \"a cross between Henry Kissinger and Minnie Mouse.\" People magazine included her in their list of \"The Most Intriguing People of the Century.\" She even made it into a Shania Twain song: \"No, I don't need proof to show me the truth/Not even Dr. Ruth is gonna tell me how I feel.\"\nWestheimer defended abortion rights, suggested older people have sex after a good night's sleep and was an outspoken advocate of condom use. She believed in monogamy.\nIn the 1980s, she stood up for gay men at the height of the AIDS epidemic and spoke out loudly for the LGBTQ community. She said she defended people deemed by some far-right Christians to be \"subhuman\" because of her own past.\nBorn Karola Ruth Siegel in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1928, she was an only child. At 10, she was sent by her parents to Switzerland to escape Kristallnacht — the Nazis' 1938 pogrom that served as a precursor to the Holocaust. She never saw her parents again; Westheimer believed they were killed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz.\nAt the age of 16, she moved to Palestine and joined the Haganah, the underground movement for Israeli independence. She was trained as a sniper, although she said she never shot at anyone.\nHer legs were severely wounded when a bomb exploded in her dormitory, killing many of her friends. She said it was only through the work of a \"superb\" surgeon that she could walk and ski again.\nShe married her first husband, an Israeli soldier, in 1950, and they moved to Paris as she pursued an education. Although not a high school graduate, Westheimer was accepted into the Sorbonne to study psychology after passing an entrance exam.\nThe marriage ended in 1955; the next year, Westheimer went to New York with her new boyfriend, a Frenchman who became her second husband and father to her daughter, Miriam.\nIn 1961, after a second divorce, she finally met her life partner: Manfred Westheimer, a fellow refugee from Nazi Germany. The couple was married and had a son, Joel. They remained wed for 36 years until \"Fred\" — as she called him — died of heart failure in 1997.\nAfter receiving her doctorate in education from Columbia University, she went on to teach at Lehman College in the Bronx. While there she developed a specialty — instructing professors how to teach sex education. It would eventually become the core of her curriculum.\n\"I soon realized that while I knew enough about education, I did not really know enough about sex,\" she wrote in her 1987 autobiography. Westheimer then decided take classes with the renowned sex therapist, Dr. Helen Singer Kaplan.\nIt was there that she had discovered her calling. Soon, as she once said in a typically folksy comment, she was dispensing sexual advice \"like good chicken soup.\"\n\"I came from an Orthodox Jewish home so sex for us Jews was never considered a sin,\" she told The Guardian in 2019.\nIn 1984, her radio program was nationally syndicated. A year later, she debuted in her own television program, \"The Dr. Ruth Show,\" which went on to win an Ace Award for excellence in cable television.\nShe also wrote a nationally syndicated advice column and later appeared in a line of videos produced by Playboy, preaching the virtues of open sexual discourse and good sex. She even had a series of calendars.\nHer rise was noteworthy for the culture of the time, in which then-President Ronald Reagan's administration was hostile to Planned Parenthood and aligned with pro-conservative voices.\nPhyllis Schlafly, a staunch anti-feminist, wrote in a 1999 piece \"The Dangers of Sex Education,\" that Westheimer, as well as Gloria Steinem, Anita Hill, Madonna, Ellen DeGeneres and others were promoting \"provocative sex chatter\" and \"rampant immorality.\"\nFather Edwin O'Brien, the director of communications for the Catholic archdiocese of New York who would go on to become a cardinal, called her work upsetting and morally compromised.\n\"It's pure hedonism,\" O'Brien wrote in a 1982 opinion published by The Wall Street Journal. \"The message is just indulge yourself; whatever feels good is good. There is no higher law of overriding morality, and there's also no responsibility.\"\nWestheimer made appearances on \"The Howard Stern Radio Show,\" \"Nightline,\" \"The Tonight Show,\" \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" \"The Dr. Oz Show\" and \"Late Night with David Letterman.\" She played herself in episodes of \"Quantum Leap\" and \"Love Boat: The Next Wave.\"\nHer books include \"Sex for Dummies,\" her autobiographical works \"All in a Lifetime\" (1987) and \"Musically Speaking: A Life through Song\" (2003). The documentary \"Ask Dr. Ruth\" aired in 2019.\nDuring her time as a radio and television personality, she remained committed to teaching, with posts at Yale, Hunter, Princeton and Columbia universities and a busy college lecture schedule. She also maintained a private practice throughout her life.\nWestheimer received an honorary doctorate from Hebrew Union College-Institute of Religion for her work in human sexuality and her commitment to the Jewish people, Israel and religion. In 2001 she received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor and the Leo Baeck Medal, and in 2004, she received the degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa, from Trinity College.\nRyan White, the director of \"Ask Dr. Ruth,\" told Vice in 2019 that Westheimer was never someone following trends. She was always an ally of gay rights and an advocate for family planning.\n\"She was at the forefront of both of those things throughout her entire life. I met her friends from her orphanage saying even when she met gay people throughout her life in the '30s, '40s, and '50s she was always accepting of those people and always saying that people should be treated with respect.\"\nShe is survived by two children, Joel and Miriam, and four grandchildren. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In 1974, Loveless got a master's in education from the same school.\nIn between earning his two degrees, Loveless was the athletic director at Colonel Richardson High School.\nHe later became the vice principal at Lockerman Middle School, and he finished his academic career at CRHS as principal.\n\"He was famous as a football coach, for no matter how cold it got, Joe never wore anything but a short-sleeved white shirt. He didn't want to show anybody that the cold bothered him,\" said Caroline County Commissioner Larry Porter.\nLoveless got into politics in the early 1980s, starting as Town Commissioner of Denton, and in 1982 becoming the town's mayor.\nHe organized celebrity golf events at the Caroline Country Club, which brought members of the Orioles and The Baltimore Colts.\n\"Joe was instrumental, years ago, he would put together a celebrity golf tournament where he would have Johnny Unitas, and a group of people would come over and play golf. He had access to them because his cousin was a newscaster,\" Porter said. \"... He would select an organization to benefit. One year it was reading programs.\"\n\"... It was a two-day event, and they would raise quite a good amount of money. Joe pulled all that together. Joe had an ability to do those things. Joe was a great guy,\" Porter said.\nPorter said at Loveless also sold real estate and cars. He founded Joe Loveless Tires.\nHe was an active member of Saint Luke's Methodist Church in Denton.\n\"When he got involved with an activity, he worked hard. He gave it everything that he had no question about that. He benefited a lot of organizations here during his time,\" Porter said.\nJohn Nussear, who went to college with Loveless, said Loveless was never short of creative ideas.\n\"Joe had an entrepreneurial spirit about him. He had a million ideas. He was never without an idea that he wanted to share and get other people interested in,\" Nussear said. \"The truth about Joe was that he was salesman — a very good salesman of ideas.\"\nNussear thinks Loveless' main legacy is his energy.\n\"Energy, and ideas and a willingness to to what it takes to put an idea into action. He was very generous to a fault. He would give his last penny to someone else if he thought that they needed it,\" Nussear said.\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, plans for a private celebration of life gathering to be held in September are incomplete. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Lemuel Dent Jr., a native of Charles County, was interred on Sept. 5 at Cheltenham Veterans Cemetery in Prince George's County. Johnson Funeral Services of White Plains performed graveside services preceding the interment.\nAt the service last week, Donald Dent, Lemuel Dent's nephew, received the flag covering his family member's coffin. Lemuel Dent was survived by four sisters and five brothers, but Donald Dent said that they have since died.\n\"It was a surprise to me,\" Donald Dent said about hearing that Lemuel's remains were identified.\nPrior to this, all Donald Dent knew was that his uncle had died during World War II.\nLemuel Dent was killed Feb. 8, 1945, at age 30 near the Cinquale Canal, north of Viareggio, Italy, when the tank he was aboard was struck by enemy fire.\nA resident of Ironsides, an area on Route 6 in Charles County, Dent was assigned to Company L, 3rd Battalion, 366th Infantry Regiment, 92nd Infantry Division, known as the \"Buffalo Soldiers\" in the European Theater.\nThe U.S. Army recognizes the 92nd Infantry Division as the only African American infantry division to see combat in Europe during World War II.\nThe tank Dent was in was struck by enemy mortar, machine gun and artillery fire. His body was not recovered at the time, and the Germans never reported him a prisoner of war, the Defense POW/MIA Account Agency said in a release.\nOn May 5, 1945, the American Graves Registration Command, Army Quartermaster Corps, was tasked with recovering missing American personnel in the European Theater. Investigators recovered a set of remains, designated as X-124 Castelfiorentino, from a gravesite approximately 2 miles west of Pietrasanta and 500 yards north of the Cinquale Canal.\nThe investigators initially identified the remains as possibly belonging to a soldier of the 92nd Infantry Division but did not have enough data to make a positive identification. The remains were interred at what is now Florence American Cemetery in Impruneta, Italy.\nDent was accounted for by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency earlier this year after X-124's remains were exhumed in June 2022 from the Italian cemetery for laboratory analysis and identification.\nAt the funeral, local veterans and family members paid their respects to Dent. Members of the Buffalo Soldiers Motorcycle Club attended to salute Dent and pay homage to the rich history of the 92nd Infantry Division.\nThe name Buffalo Soldiers was initially selected for the club to pay homage to and ensure the legacy of African American military contributions in the post-Civil War era, according to the motorcycle club's website. The membership of the club is comprised of many active duty and retired service members, as well as law enforcement.\n\"I think it's a huge deal,\" Lonnie Bellamy, a member of Maryland's Buffalo Soldier chapter, said. \"Taking the time to do all that work to lay him to rest, spending all that energy to put a name to the remains. … It absolutely resonated with us.\"\nIn Italy, Lemuel Dent's name is recorded on the Tablets of the Missing at Florence American Cemetery.\nNow, a rosette rests alongside his name, indicating he has been accounted for and brought home. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Judge Wise served community, county and the law\n\n September 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 845\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — From Caroline High School, to lawyer, to state's attorney and finally to Circuit Court judge for Caroline County, James Owen Wise was described as both fair and impartial. He served Caroline County from the bench for 17 years. He died on Wednesday, Sept 4, at 86 years old.Wise helped begin a chapter of Court Appointed Special Advocates. He saw too many children who needed advocacy as their parents went through the court system, so he did something about it.\n\"It was his idea definitely. He sat on the bench and heard foster care cases,\" said Joanne Staples, the first executive director of CASA of Caroline. \"He knew what was going on and what was not going on. He could see that they needed more support than they were getting. He decided that something different needed to be done.\"\nSomething different was CASA.\n\"There was no doubt in his mind that it was needed and that it was the right thing to do for these children,\" Staples said. \"He was an extremely fair person. He listened intently from all sides. He knew it from A to Z.\"\nWise cared about the affairs and people of Caroline County.\n\"We were good friends for many years. We played a lot of golf together and went on a lot of golf trips together,\" County Commissioner Larry Porter said. \"He was an incredible advocate for the county. It is a tremendous loss to me as a friend and to the county.\"\nPorter added, \"He was the past president and assistant chief of the fire company. He was a member of the fire company until he got appointed judge. He probably had the most integrity of anybody I have ever known and at the same time was probably one of the most humble guys. He avoided saying that he was a judge.\"\nPorter said that Wise served as judge on the police accountability board. He gave every situation a tremendous amount of thought. He was always looking at it from every angle.\nWise chaired the committee that made the decision for Caroline County to go to home rule. This gave the county the authority to enact, amend and repeal local laws, according to the Caroline County website. Porter said Wise was involved with county policy and government.\n\"He is one of those guys that is kind of like Forrest Gump,\" Porter said. \"Every time you look at something, he was involved, or he knew about it. He could explain what happened.\"\nRetired Caroline County Judge Karen Jensen succeeded Wise on the bench in 1999. She practiced as a lawyer before him as well. Wise's family asked her to speak at Wise's funeral.\n\"As a judge, he was always very prepared. He was always very fair. When I say 'no nonsense,' you came in and you were expected to be prepared as well as he was prepared. As a lawyer, I really enjoyed practicing in front of him,\" Jensen said.\nShe said he would come to the courthouse on his days off.\n\"If he was uptown going to the bank or to the post office, he just would come in and go to the clerk's office and talk to everybody. He would come up to chamber and sit down and shoot the breeze and have a cup of coffee. He was always connected with the people of Caroline County,\" Jensen said.\nShe pointed to his unique legacy of having his father as a judge too. Being a judge has its challenges.\n\"He never disconnected from the community, which is a hard thing to do when you are a judge,\" Jensen said. \"When you become a judge, there is a disconnect because you have to be fair. You don't want anyone thinking you are being unduly influenced. But in a small county, it is hard to do that. He found a good balance of remaining always connected with the community and the people he loved and still maintain impartiality and fairness he needed to have.\"\nOne of the causes he was passionate about was Court Appointed Special Advocates. He has set up memorial donations to CASA of Caroline.\n\"Right after he retired from the bench, he founded CASA and served as the organization's first board president. He worked very closely with Joanne Staples to the develop this CASA program. She was our first executive director,\" said Amy Horne, current executive director of CASA of Caroline.\nHorne's father served on the Talbot County Circuit Court bench while Wise served in Caroline. They were good friends, she said.\n\"Judge Wise was an incredibly thoughtful man. He would stop by and say hello whenever he was in town. He was always thinking of what he could do to help others, what he could do to contribute to society,\" Horne said.\nAccording to Moore Funeral Home, a visitation will be held Monday, Sept. 16, from 10 until 11:30 a.m. at St. Luke's Church, 100 S. Fifth Ave. in Denton, with a memorial service following at 11:30. A reception will follow. Burial is private.\nDonations may be made to CASA of Caroline Inc.: casaofcarolineinc-bloom.kindful.com or by mail to 114 Market St., Suite 100, Denton, MD 21629. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There, she learned values that carried with her throughout her life.\n\"When I get up, my prayer is, 'Dear Lord, help me help those who need help the most,'\" Webb told Southern Maryland News. \"I think people should help each other wherever they see the need for help.\"\nWebb's compassion and care for those in her life has been apparent to anyone that has spent time around her, as she has always been there for others in need. After her retirement from nursing in 1980, she has spent tremendous time and energy in giving others a home.\nShe lived in Waldorf for over 50 years, making her home welcome to guests from East Africa, victims of domestic abuse, the homeless, her family in the wake of her brother's passing and babysitting Nigerian twins until they were teenagers — to name a few of her household guests.\nThose who have been under her care have kept in touch, some calling as often as weekly.\nWebb has been active in her community and throughout the entire Southern Maryland region, volunteering and working in events and organizations like the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life, the Children's Aid Society's Board, the Area Council on Aging and a coordinator of National Night Out in her neighborhood.\nFor five decades, Webb has been an active member of the African American Heritage Society of Charles County. She is currently their oldest member and was one of the helpers in securing the African American Heritage House, which sits along the southbound lanes of Route 301 in La Plata.\n\"I wanted to be busy, just like now,\" Webb said. \"I like to be busy.\"\nShe was an attendee of Bel Alton High School, which opened in 1938 when she was 14.\nThe Charles County Fair, which started the same year as Webb's birth, was another pleasure of hers. Webb fondly remembers her garden exhibits, where she would enter everything she possibly could.\nShe recalled how she was told by someone at the fair, \"Everywhere I look, it's got your name on it.\"\nOne of the biggest changes that Webb has seen in the county in her lifetime was the building of infrastructure, most notably how roads and transportation developed.\nAlways keeping busy, Webb did not stop driving until this past February.\nIn 2007, Webb returned to her family's farm in Bryantown where she currently resides. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Rich Colburn died Friday in Easton at the age of 74.Colburn, a Republican, spent 28 years in Annapolis. He served as a state senator for 20 years and as a member of the House of Delegates for eight years. His district covered Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot and Wicomico counties.\nAfter leaving office in 2015, Colburn remained involved on the Eastern Shore. He completed a 24-year stretch as the town manager for Federalsburg and was the commander of American Legion Post 91 in Cambridge.\nFormer colleagues and those who knew his work spoke highly of his commitment to constituent service.\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said Colburn was a \"fearless leader\" in the statehouse. Mautz called Colburn a \"relentless\" politician.\n\"He was a master at all things Annapolis, and that was an expertise that he developed,\" Mautz said. \"(It was) something he was willing to share with anybody that was willing to listen and learn.\"\n\"Rich was just a larger than life man who was loved by everybody in Annapolis and on the Eastern Shore,\" Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said.\nRep. Andy Harris (R-Md) shared his condolences in a post on X Friday evening.\n\"Today we mourn the passing of Senator Richard Colburn who was not just a colleague, but a friend,\" Harris wrote. \"I had the pleasure of serving with him in the Maryland State Senate and shared his passion in fighting for our watermen, farmers, Veterans and first responders.\"\nMautz said he's thankful to have learned from Colburn's political acumen, calling him a mentor. The current state senator said once Colburn made his mind up, \"he would be undeniable in the pursuit of getting some kind of resolution to whatever it is he was working on.\"\nIn a statement on social media, the Maryland Republican Party praised the impact Colburn had on the Mid-Shore.\n\"His legacy as an accomplished legislator who fought hard for agriculture, conservative values, bi-partisan governance, and Eastern Shore representation, was profound and will be felt in Maryland for generations,\" the statement read.\nDorchester County Council Vice President Mike Detmer said in a statement that Colburn \"was a dedicated public servant who worked on issues big and small with thoroughness and tenacity.\"\n\"I will truly miss our rambling inside baseball conversations and his wry sense of humor as a friend,\" Detmer wrote, \"and I will also miss his advice and mentorship as someone who is trying to follow the same path that he walked: trying to make (a) mark by trying to make a difference.\"\nColburn was born in Oxford and grew up on the Eastern Shore. Former Oxford Town Commissioner Jimmy Jaramillo expressed his appreciation for Colburn's mentorship in a statement.\n\"He was a mentor and friend who gave me my start in politics and was devoted to District 37,\" Jaramillo wrote. \"His leadership and love for Oxford, where he was raised, and the entire district left a lasting mark on our community. I'm grateful for his guidance and support over the years.\"\nThe late senator graduated from Easton High School in 1968. After school, he joined the U.S. Army and served during the Cold War. He stayed for three years and earned the rank of sergeant.\nIn 1978, Colburn ran for a seat in the House of Delegates but lost. Four years later, Colburn won, beginning his political career in Annapolis. He was reelected in 1986.\nHis time in the House of Delegates ended in 1991. In 1994, following the retirement of longtime Democratic Sen. Frederick C. Malkus Jr., Colburn won his first Senate term.\nColburn won four additional terms before falling to Republican opponent and former state Sen. Addie Eckardt in the 2014 primary for the Senate seat.\nColburn played a large role in pushing forward many infrastructure projects on the Eastern Shore, including the Dover Bridge that connects Caroline and Talbot counties. He helped secure funding for the bridge, a process that took decades of advocacy.\nMautz says Colburn will be \"sorely\" missed, regardless of where political lines may fall.\n\"He did a lot of things and didn't ask for credit, and I think a lot of people are unaware of a lot of the good things that he's done to help people, the Eastern Shore and the state of Maryland,\" Mautz said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'A Shore Senator': Friends, colleagues reflect on contributions of the late Sen. Rich Colburn\n\n December 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1023\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Community members and politicians alike are reflecting on the vast impact former state Sen. Rich Colburn had on the Eastern Shore. The longtime legislator died Friday. He was 74.Colburn has been described as consistent, relentless and committed to both his work in Annapolis as a legislator and his involvement in local communities, according to family, peers and friends.\nDave Wilson, chairman of Preston Automotive Group, called Colburn a \"true friend.\" Wilson recalled that the late senator constantly reached out, offering help and always following through.\nA campaign slogan Colburn used, \"A Shore Senator,\" promised dependability and care for the people of the region. Wilson says Colburn's life shows he made true on that promise.\n\"Some slogans people don't live by,\" Wilson said. \"He lived by his. He represented everybody on the Shore.\"\nColburn, a Republican, spent 28 years in Annapolis. He served as a state senator for 20 years after eight years in the House of Delegates. His district covered Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot and Wicomico counties.\nFormer colleagues, legislators and those who knew his work spoke highly of his commitment to his constituents. Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said Colburn was a \"fearless leader\" in the statehouse and a \"relentless\" politician.\n\"He was a master at all things Annapolis, and that was an expertise that he developed,\" Mautz said. \"(It was) something he was willing to share with anybody that was willing to listen and learn.\"\nCONSTITUENT SERVICEBorn in Oxford in 1950, Colburn grew up on the Eastern Shore. He graduated from Easton High School in 1968. After school, he joined the U.S. Army and served during the Cold War. He stayed for three years and earned the rank of sergeant.\nThe late senator worked at the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, now SuperFresh, for 25 years, and he served as Federalsburg's town manager for 24 years.\nAs his political career took off, he maintained connections across Mid-Shore counties. While Talbot County was his birthplace, he worked in Caroline and lived in Dorchester counties.\nJeannie Haddaway-Riccio, a former House of Delegates member who worked with Colburn while he was a senator, said he was an \"incredible mentor.\" Haddaway-Riccio said his commitment to watermen and farmers on the Eastern Shore was unmatched.\n\"He really had what I would call an unrivaled work ethic, particularly when it came to fighting for his constituents and helping them with the issues that they had,\" she said.\nFour years after his time in the House of Delegates ended, Colburn won his first Senate term, assuming the seat from the retired Democratic Sen. Frederick C. Malkus Jr. in 1995.\nLen Foxwell, a veteran political and campaign strategist, worked with Colburn on multiple campaigns, but also worked for an opposing campaign during the 1994 election. Foxwell says keeping up with Colburn was impossible.\n\"In his prime, he was unbeatable because he simply outflanked, outhustled and outworked his opposition,\" Foxwell said.\nColburn won four additional terms before falling to Republican opponent and former state Sen. Addie Eckardt in the 2014 primary for the Senate seat.\nEckardt says Colburn was a master campaigner.\n\"He stayed out in front of his community, fighting for the very Eastern Shore conservative values,\" she said. \"He's very persistent and intentional in what he does because he's been a real student of government and politics and history.\"\nColburn played a large role in pushing forward many infrastructure projects on the Eastern Shore, including the Dover Bridge that connects Caroline and Talbot counties. He helped secure funding for the bridge, a process that took decades of advocacy.\nParty lines didn't slow Colburn down, colleagues say. Instead, his ability to work across the aisle and respect the process of government allowed him to successfully serve his constituents for decades.\n\"Nobody in elected office ever fought harder for the Eastern Shore than Rich Colburn,\" Foxwell said.\nCOMMUNITY IMPACTColburn was a consistent mentor and friend in life, many have said since his sudden death Friday.\nWhether it was attending events at local fire halls, serving as post commander for American Legion Post 91 in Cambridge or rooting on his favorite baseball team, the Baltimore Orioles, Colburn was a familiar face who loved his community.\n\"As the Commander of the Dorchester Post 91 American Legion, he was a pillar of strength and a guiding light for all who knew him,\" Post 91 said in a Facebook post. \"His steadfast commitment to honoring veterans and fostering unity within the Legion will never be forgotten.\"\n\"His leadership and love for Oxford, where he was raised, and the entire district left a lasting mark on our community,\" former Oxford Town Commissioner Jimmy Jaramillo said in a statement. \"I'm grateful for his guidance and support over the years.\"\nDorchester County Council Vice President Mike Detmer said in a statement, \"I will truly miss our rambling inside baseball conversations and his wry sense of humor as a friend, and I will also miss his advice and mentorship as someone who is trying to follow the same path that he walked: trying to make (a) mark by trying to make a difference.\"\nColburn is survived by his wife of over 20 years, Alma Colburn, daughter Johanna Hamilton and son-in-law Bobby Hamilton, and granddaughter Saylor. Alma Colburn said 7-year-old Saylor was the joy of his life, as they often traveled to and from North Carolina to spend time with her.\nDave Wilson of Preston Automotive Group said Colburn never forgot to call him on Feb. 9, their shared birthday. Small gestures such as that yearly phone call, or their love for the Orioles, will forever be remembered.\n\"That's what I'm going to miss the most,\" Wilson said. \"I'm going to miss those Feb. 9 calls.\"\nIn Wilson's experience, Colburn extended his help for issues small and large. When the Preston dealership suffered a massive fire in 2000, the state senator was one of the first to help. That knack for serving the community was never-ending, says Wilson.\n\"His legacy will live on,\" Wilson said. \"He was the perfect person to represent the Shore and be part of the Shore. He just really was. When we look back on it, if there was a Hall of Fame for that, he should be in it.\"\nThis story has been updated to correct the relatives of Sen. Rich Colburn. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Having worked with Sen. Rich Colburn for more than 30 years, I believe four characteristics explain why he was so successful for so long.First, he just outworked everyone. I had the privilege of managing the 1994 State Senate campaign of his opponent, Hugh M. Smith. A typical Saturday on the hustings would consist of us arriving at every stop 25 minutes after he had been there, shaken every hand and headed for the next thing. Only to have Rich gently needle us later that day for having missed the Burrsville Ruritan Oyster Dumpling Dinner, the Greensboro Fire Department chicken BBQ or something similar. It was literally impossible to keep pace with him.\nSecond, nobody ever delivered better customer service and delivered better results than Rich. During my tenure at the Maryland Comptroller's Office, I received more calls from Rich than from any other trio of senators I can think of. And once he asked for help, he would hound me relentlessly to make sure I hadn't forgotten, that I was still \"on it\" and that it was being worked out. State officials would typically want to complete the casework just so Rich would stop bothering them. And he knew it.\nThird, Rich had a Jedi-like command of what his constituents needed to hear. I will never forget a campaign forum in which he was asked about his public safety platform. Rich stood up and said the following:\n\"They're now talking in Washington about three strikes and you're out. I don't believe in that.\" And he hesitated.\nThe room went silent. Had Rich \"gone liberal\" on crime?\nThen, this: \"I believe in one strike and you're dead.\"\nBedlam erupted throughout the hall. Afterward, he pulled me aside and said, \"They know I didn't mean that. People just need to hear that the politicians will keep them safe and that's how I get my point across.\"\nFinally, Rich was an institutionalist who deeply respected the legislative process, knew bipartisan relationships were essential to getting things done in a Democratic state, and understood that was only there to make life better for the folks back home.\nRich Colburn was a man of the Shore, and he left an indelible mark on this place he so dearly loved. He will be remembered for decades to come.\nLEN FOXWELL\nBaltimore \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

For Barth, it attacked the right side of his body, leaving him in a wheelchair for a period.\nPolio taught him to take his health more seriously, he said.\n\"I was in the University Hospital in Baltimore for about six or seven weeks,\" Barth said. \"... and I think when you're really sick when you're younger, you respect your health more as you grow up.\"\nBarth began his career as a 13 year-old boy in Howard County. Barth stopped going to school to help his family of 10 siblings work on their farm. His father had to go back to work to make more money because the farm wasn't making enough. Barth took over and worked the family farm until he got polio.\n\"I managed to farm. I did all the farm work. We had cows, horses, all kinds of chickens and poultry. And at 13, and I did all the field plowing, putting crops and things like that.\"\nBarth had many jobs. He worked at a defense plant for the Army making copper brass. He then moved to be a lumber manager at a hardware store for 20 years, and then to the post office for 18 years.\nIn Barth's first marriage, he adopted two children, who he said he loves dearly.\nHe married his second wife, Clara Barth, on July 8, 1984. They moved to Caroline County in 1989 and opened and operated a store for 12 years. The store sold baked goods and candy, sorted mail and much more.\nBarth's career didn't end until just five years ago.\n\"I worked in Queenstown for an estate,\" Barth said. \"I was a carpenter helping the Kenny family build a new home on a big ranch. I also did trim work in the house, and after we finished the trim we built a new three-car garage.\"\nBarth's stepson got him the job at the estate, but after his stepson left he stayed for another 12 years as the family's maintenance man.\n\"I stayed there for another 12 years after he left,\" Barth said. \"I did maintenance work and I did outside work. I trimmed about eight acres of woods out in Lake Central Park and planted the grass and did the mowing and painted everything as maintenance on a 32 acre land.\"\nBarth's credits his hard working mentality as the reason he has lived to 100 years old.\n\"All my activity, all these years, when you stay active, it's much better for you,\" Barth said.\nHe also credits a good mental outlook on life.\n\"I looked at the good side of everything,\" Barth stated. \"I think the mental outlook makes a big difference in your health, too. You try to look at the good side of anything.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

All in all, Hurley served as chief of the fire company from 1990 to 1994, from 1996 to 2002 and from 2004 to 2010.\nIn 2004, he was made a life member of the fire company.\nTravers said Hurley was an advocate who helped move Rescue Fire Company forward.\n\"He fought with the city to make sure that they knew we were a part of the city and that they had to get the building permits to run through us,\" Travers said.\nAccording to a social media post from Rescue Fire Company, even after his last term as chief, Hurley would still show up to fire incidents from time to time, sharing his expertise with firemen.\n\"My phone rang once or twice a week with him,\" said current Rescue Fire Chief Brad Walters, laughing.\nWalters, who in his first years with the company worked under Hurley, said Hurley was a \"strong-willed\" leader who fought for what the department needed.\n\"He was the cornerstone of where we are and how we operate now,\" Walters said. \"Every piece of apparatus inside the fire house at this time has his name attached to it in some manner. Whether he was on the committee, whether he was the chief overseeing it. Specifically, some of the engines. He fought extremely hard with the city to purchase the needed equipment for our department.\"\nWalters said Hurley was also \"kind hearted.\" He said he remembers Hurley helping him out and giving him side jobs when he was younger.\n\"He was there to make sure everyone excelled around him,\" Walters said.\nHurley served his community in more ways than one. He spent his career at Jess Jr's & Son's, a collision repair shop and towing service in Cambridge. He served in multiple positions as a member of the Cambridge Yacht Club, ultimately becoming the club's commodore.\nHis involvement spanned from the Cambridge Rotary Club, to the Maryland State Firefighters Association, to the Maryland Fire Chiefs Association to the Towing and Recovery Professionals of Maryland.\n\"He was a leader in the community,\" Travers said.\nHurley will be remembered for his friendship. Martin Pepper, who met Hurley in 1986 and served multiple years as assistant chief when Hurley was chief, said Hurley was very important to him.\n\"He was a very good friend to me,\" Pepper said. \"Good friend to a lot of people, but we were very close.\"\nDuring a Cambridge City Council meeting on Jan. 27, Commission President Sputty Cephas talked about his friendship with Hurley.\n\"There wasn't a time that we couldn't go to Jeff for whatever,\" he said, later adding, that Hurley will \"truly\" be missed.\nHurley is survived by his son, Jeffery O. Hurley Jr. (Sarah); bonus sons Joshua Bauguess (Kayla) and Noah Bauguess (Deanna); brother Jed M. Hurley Sr. (Brenda); nephew Jed \"J.R.\" Hurley Jr. (Abbie); niece Amanda Jo Hurley Hallowell (Logan); great nieces Abriella Hallowell, Leilani Hallowell and Maddie Hurley; great nephew Jed M. Hurley III and God children Brandon Hall, JR Moore and Maddie Fleming.\nHurley is preceded in death by his parents, daughter Jessica Anne Hurley and his brother, Jay L. Hurley.\nServices will be held Friday, Jan. 31. A visitation will be held from 10 a.m. to noon at the Public Safety Building at 8 Washington St. in Cambridge. The visitation will be followed by a firefighter memorial service at noon at the Public Safety Building. After that, a brief procession will pass by Jess Jr's & Son's and the old fire house at 307 Gay St. before entering Dorchester Memorial Park for burial services. A wake will be held after the burial at the East New Market Volunteer Fire Department. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Mrs. Hollis was my compass,’ my true north': Pioneering educator and community activist dies at 97\n\n February 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DOUG BISHOP | Section: News \n \n 479\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — Madelyn Matthews Hollis, 97, a dedicated educator who taught for more than three decades in Queen Anne's County schools and became a steadfast community advocate, died Thursday, Feb. 20, while under care at Compass Hospice in Centreville.Born in Accomack County, Virginia, Hollis arrived in Centreville in 1948 when she was hired by then-Superintendent Harry Rhodes to teach mathematics at Kennard High School, which served African American students during segregation.\nHollis taught at Kennard until 1966, when segregation ended in Queen Anne's County. She then transferred to Queen Anne's County High School, where she taught mathematics and driver's education until her retirement in 1981 after 33 years in education.\n\"She was a really good teacher,\" said former student Naimbi Davis of Centreville. \"She was not a coddler with students. However, she knew how to teach them. Math was never my subject, but Mrs. Hollis taught me the essentials.\"\nBeyond her teaching career, Hollis was deeply involved in community service. She was an active member of New Life United Methodist Church in Centreville and served as president of the Lucretia Kennard Homemaker's Club for at least 16 years.\nPerhaps her most enduring legacy came through her fierce advocacy to preserve the former Kennard High School building when it faced demolition after closing. That preservation effort, spearheaded by Hollis and carried forward by alumni, culminated in the 2019 dedication of the Kennard African American Cultural Center and Museum.\nClayton Washington, who led the alumni restoration efforts, said, \"Mrs. Hollis was 'my compass,' my true north. She kept me on point. She always told me, 'Boy, don't start something you can't finish!' When we dedicated the Kennard African American Center in May 2019, I was pleased I could say to her, 'We got it done!' I know she was happy.\"\nFrom 1985 to 1995, Hollis served on the Queen Anne's County Public Schools Board, appointed by then-Maryland Governor Harry Hughes. During her tenure, she was instrumental in establishing Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday as a school holiday in the county.\nFormer board colleague Elizabeth Broderick described Hollis as \"an icon of the community\" who \"went to college earning her teaching degree when going to college was not open to everyone, especially African American women.\"\nHollis was known for her strong Christian faith and believed that prayer in schools taught students respect for \"a higher being\" that could be applied to all aspects of life.\nHer former classroom at the Kennard African American Cultural Center features her picture, her name, and writing on the blackboard in her handwriting—a tribute to \"living history.\"\n\"She was one of my favorite teachers,\" said Jim Brown, a Kennard High School graduate and former Grasonville Community Center President. \"I'd say she was a very kind Christian lady, who was devoted to her church, Kennard, and her work with the NAACP. I say she was a community activist.\"\nA Celebration of Life will be held later in March. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was 84 years old.\nWroten served with the department for 38 years, 30 of which as chief. Hurley, who served under Wroten for many years, said Wroten stood up to crime and stood up for his officers.\n\"He did a lot for this department, and he was there a long time,\" Hurley said. \"He did make a difference in the City of Cambridge.\"\nCurrent Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd remembers Wroten as someone who took his job seriously and knew the city \"like the back of his hand.\"\nTodd remembers being less than a year into the job when Wroten pulled Todd into his office to tell him he was retiring and share his thoughts on what Todd needed to do to have a successful career.\n\"Him taking that time to say that to me, who — I'm brand new, definitely carried with me throughout the years,\" Todd said, adding the experience illustrated Wroten's leadership.\nLast year, Wroten was recognized as the first inductee into the Cambridge Police Department Hall of Fame. Todd said he was the first person who came to mind when the department decided it wanted to begin recognizing officers.\n\"I mean, 30 years as the chief of police, he saw a lot of officers come and go,\" Todd said. \"He saw the racial riots. He saw Cambridge at its worst. And we just thought that that definitely needed to be recognized.\"\nServing the department through multiple decades, Wroten saw good times and tumultuous times in Cambridge. During a time of civil unrest Cambridge experienced in July 1967, Wroten — who was an officer at that time — was shot while investigating a broken window at a laundromat in the 2nd Ward. The incident caused the police chief at the time, Brice Kinnamon, to order the ward be sealed off by police.\nFollowing Kinnamon, Wroten became chief four years later.\nHurley said although Wroten was well-respected, law enforcement officials often face criticism. \"But he took care of the job,\" Hurley said. \"He took care of the city.\"\nA graduate of the FBI Academy, Wroten received multiple awards and citations in his career, according to his obituary.\nOutside of his career, Wroten was a member of multiple organizations, including Cambridge Masonic Lodge 66, Rescue Fire Company and Cambridge Elks Lodge 1272.\nAccording to his obituary, Russell is survived by his wife of 62 years Regina Wroten of East New Market, their daughter Christina \"Chrissy\" and son-in-law Tom Thompson of Cambridge, granddaughter Savana \"Jon\" Linthicum of Rhodesdale, great-granddaughter Arya, several nephews and a niece.\nWroten's funeral will be held Tuesday, April 22, at Newcomb and Collins Funeral Home in Cambridge. Visitation will be from 11 a.m. until 1 p.m. The service, which will include the city police honor guard, will begin at 1 p.m. Burial will be in East New Market. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Price, a former screenwriter during the Black Arts Movement and an influential figure in the arts community, spent the final 18 years of his life in Chestertown, where he co-founded the Kent County Poetry Festival, worked extensively with the Kent Cultural Alliance and contributed to preserving local African American history.Price was a prolific writer with several books of poetry, including \"Wise Blood\" and \"Blood Flow\", the latter of which earned him the William Meredith Award. His work transcended genres, with over a dozen of his plays produced, including notable works like \"Blue Monk\", which was commissioned for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. His plays were performed internationally, with productions in Johannesburg, Berlin, and across the United States.\nPrice's career spanned several decades and locations. Born in Atlanta, Georgia, he studied at Clark Atlanta University and later moved to Los Angeles, where he joined the Black Arts Movement and contributed to the L.A. Rebellion. He received the prestigious William Wyler Fellowship for Screenwriting from the American Film Institute, and collaborated with well-known figures such as Norman Lear and Alex Haley on the TV series \"Palmerstown, U.S.A.\" His work earned him an NAACP Image Award and recognition for his activism, including co-founding the Black Anti-Defamation Coalition in 1980.\nIn addition to his achievements in screenwriting and theater, Price was a dedicated educator. He served as Artist-in-Residence at Washington College in Chestertown, where he wrote and produced two new plays. His work also contributed to understanding slavery during the Revolutionary Era, particularly through productions such as \"The Unlading\", a work that gave better perception of the role of slavery in Eastern Shore history.\nPrice's poetry and plays often incorporated jazz and blues, blending these musical forms with themes of resistance and social justice. His work explored African American history, celebrated cultural icons, and pushed the boundaries of traditional theater. His friends and colleagues remember him for his sharp wit, deep wisdom, and unwavering belief in the power of art to challenge the status quo.\nChristopher Ames, president emeritus of Russell Sage College, worked with Price in both Atlanta and Chestertown. \"I first met Robert Earl when I was serving on the board of 7Stages, the innovative theater company in Atlanta, where he was the Playwright in Residence. Later, when I moved to Chestertown to serve as Provost and Dean at Washington College, I was thrilled to hire Robert Earl as a part-time Artist in Residence in the Drama Department,\" Ames said. \"He and his wife embraced this community, and Robert Earl's impact was immediate and lasting. Together, we conceived the Kent County Poetry Festival with the help of Tom Martin and The Book Plate. Robert Earl was not just a co-founder; he was the heartbeat of the festival, present and actively organizing every year until this last April, when he was on his deathbed. His passion for poetry, community, and the arts was unmatched, and his legacy will continue to influence the festival and the arts scene here for years to come.\"\nA devoted father and grandfather, Price is survived by his partner of 33 years, Carol Colgate; three children, Dhati Price, Makini Jones (Elzia), and Mshinda Jones (Lisa); five grandchildren, Ariana, Phylicia, Philip, Jamal, and Bashiri Halan; and one great-grandson, Brayden.\nA memorial service will be held in Chestertown June 21.\nPrice's legacy as a poet, playwright, and cultural advocate will continue to inspire and shape the Eastern Shore arts community for years to come. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A story of sacrifice: Sergeant's service long remembered\n\n May 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Life \n \n 990\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Lifelong Betterton resident and historian Larry Crew stands at the foot of three gravestones in the golden light of waning day at Still Pond Cemetery, reflecting.One stone is his father's, Larry Sr. He was a merchant marine, and often regaled Crew with stories of surviving storms and torpedoes in World War II. Next to him lies Stephen J. Crew, brother.\nBeside Stephen, with American flag fluttering and a wreath, lies the stone of Crew's younger brother, U.S. Army Sergeant Carl Joseph Crew, who lost his life defending his nation in Vietnam March 24, 1969.\nLike many who fought that war, Carl never gave his brother or family a full report on what he did as part of the U.S. Army Americal Division after finishing his training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\nBut Crew, the older brother, attending the University of Baltimore at the time for business, was wise enough to read between the lines of the letters Carl sent back each week in 1968-1969. While his letters described the landscape and countryside innocently enough, the pictures provided the truth.\n\"They were just soldiers in a line, in jungles, fields, walking the countryside, waiting to get shot at,\" Crew said.\nSgt. Carl Crew told his grandmother even less not wanting her to worry, writing to her that he \"spends a lot of time on the beach.\" His immediate family knew better. They knew there were young soldiers dying from Kent County in the war combined with that sense of foreboding those pictures spoke of to Crew.\nHis family seemed to know it would just be a matter of time. \"You just counted the days,\" Crew said.\nIt came. One day, Crew said he and his family were in their house at the center of town when an ordinary car pulled up and a uniformed soldier made their way toward them. Crew does not remember who it was — just the woeful message he delivered.\nCarl was killed before his 21st birthday which would have been Aug. 5, 1969.\nHis brother's funeral, Crew noted, practically drew out the entire town.\nTo Kent County he was not known as sergeant, he was known as Carl, an adventurous youth, great with mechanics, a charismatic outdoorsman who loved hunting fishing and especially guns, and wanted to stay in Kent County to enjoy the simple life.\nCrew remembered his brother's ambition, working jobs while still in school. He worked at Newsome's Garage the auto shop in Betterton and the butcher shop at the A&P, close to Philosopher's Terrace in Chestertown, now the Dollar General.\n\"His whole life was here,\" Crew said.\nCrew, who always sensed Carl was involved in something more dangerous than he let on, got confirmation of that from one of his brother's war comrades who wrote to him. In the letter, this gentleman said Carl was their M-60 gunner, which put a huge target on his back for the enemy.\nThe operator of the devastating M-60 had to hold the weapon's weight at 23 pounds plus the weight of the belt of cartridges where a belt of 100 rounds weighed 7 pounds. When the weapon was deployed, it took down everything in its path, soldiers, tunnels, trees, the whole forest line. So when the enemy spotted a M-60 gunner, their primary goal was to attack him first, much like a sniper in the trees thought about officers.\nIt was these deadly conditions that Carl lived out daily. \"Everywhere he went they tried to take him out,\" Crew surmised.\nHis brother who loved guns, mechanics, adventure, and learned skills quickly, would have excelled with the weapon, and built stocky and strong, would have been able to carry it efficiently.\nAnd although Crew has no records of his brother's platoon's conflicts, Carl must have been highly valued, going from the rank of E-1 to sergeant in less than a year, Crew stated.\nAlthough Carl is not mentioned specifically, the Americal Division is unique and special in itself. It was one of two divisions not numbered, formed in World War II, 1942 on the island of New Caledonia. Then it was reformed during Vietnam as the Americal (\"American, New Caledonian Division\") or 23rd Infantry Division, which it was rarely called.\nIn World War II, it was the first United States Army unit to conduct an offensive operation against the enemy in either the Pacific or European Theaters of Operation. The Americal Division was described as the most effective of all the U.S. Army divisions on Guadalcanal, some historians noted.\nAfter being inactivated for a time, they were reactivated in Vietnam with a mission to operate in close cooperation with the 1st Marine Division in South Vietnam.\nDuring their six-year deployment in Nam, Americal engaged in jungle warfare and was reported to have never lost a major battle. But those wins came with high costs. According to statistics,, American KIA's for the Americal infantry brigades in Vietnam were: 196th LIB (1,188), 11th LIB (1,109), 198th LIB (987), 199th LIB (757).\nOf the 987, Carl was one of those.\nDuring that night battle March, 1969, Sergeant Carl Joseph Crew lost his life, as reported from several military sites, through \"hostile action...multiple fragmentation wounds.\" The incident location was in South Vietnam, the Quang Tin province.\nAttached to 198th Light Infantry Brigade, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry, B Company, he received the purple heart and other accommodations throughout his short military career.\nBut these military records, although decorated, do not tell the complete picture of his experiences.\nCrew said he often walks past the graves and as many do, thinks what life would have been if his brother were alive today. He thinks what if Carl was not a casualty of a night attack and returned to Betterton, to the place he loved, where he always wanted to stay.\nAs Memorial Day approaches, Crew tells the story of his brother as a way to remember those other officers in Still Pond Cemetery and cemeteries around the nation. The stories of the soldiers that were not told in their entirety, like his brother's, does not lessen their sacrifice. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was elected to his first term as mayor in September 2011 and was reelected to a second term in September 2013.\n\"My dad was a great man,\" Beall's son, Ben Beall, said. \"He loved this town, and he loved just being able to find ways to to make it better for the people. He was never a man about himself or fortune or fame. He just wanted to do the right thing for the people in the community.\"\nCurrent Federalsburg Councilwoman Brandy James said she would get emails from Beall with advice on running the town.\nBeall grew up in Texas. He majored in business administration and minored in marketing at Texas State University before he was recruited by the Dixie Cup division of the American Can Company. Beall was a sales representative in a number of cities and states before being promoted to district manager in the Baltimore/Washington area. From there, he was promoted to manager at corporate headquarters in Greenwich, Conn.\nAfter 21 years with Dixie Cup, he took early retirement and was vice president of a national sales and marketing company. In 2002, he was recruited as a sales representative for Oakwood Homes in Delaware. Shortly afterward, he was promoted to general manager for its Jacksonville, North Carolina location. A reorganization sent Beall back to Federalsburg, where he was a senior energy analyst with Atlantic Energy Resources.\nBeall and his wife, Madeline, were married for 60 years, they would've celebrated 61 years together on the Fourth of July. They met when they were 14 years old. She said he waited until he was able to drive to take her on their first date.\n\"We were driving down the Main Street in Austin, Texas, and we drove we past the funeral home there, and he said, 'People are just dying to get in there,' and I thought that was so funny. He could always make me laugh,\" Madeline Beall said. \"Humor and laughter is a big part of our family and our friends.\"\nBen Beall remembered the time he went with his father to spring training to see their favorite team, the New York Yankees.\n\"We were big baseball fans and love the New York Yankees, and he brought me to Fort Lauderdale for spring training,\" Ben Beall said. \"I was 10 years old, and we went to a few games. He booked us at the the same hotel that the Yankees were staying at. So I got like 20 autographs, and I was just on Cloud 9. He just made it a really special weekend for me.\"\nBeall's daughter Rebecca Beall-Ochsner remembered her father for all the work he did in Federalsburg for children.\n\"He was a huge advocate for kids,\" Ochsner said. \"One of my fondest memories of coming to visit is when he bought really nice shirts and pants for some kiddos in the neighborhood to wear to church and gave them Bibles, and I think that that influenced them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'The best of us': Montana cowboy poet Wally McRae dead at 89\n\n July 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Amanda Eggert Montana Free Press | Section: News \n \n 1037\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Cowboy poet Wallace \"Wally\" McRae of Colstrip died June 22 at the age of 89. McRae gained fame in Montana — and across the country — for the resonance of his voice and the causes he furthered with it.The youngest of three children, McRae grew up steeped in cowboy culture and was drawn to entertaining from a young age. He found success in both arenas. In 2020, he was inducted into the Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame. A long list of statewide and national organizations recognized McRae's creative contributions, including the National Endowment for the Arts.\nIn a 2018 interview with Andy Hedges, McRae recounted how at 4-years-old, he recited a little poem at a local Christmas program that was so warmly received it left a lasting impression. \"I mean — it was showtime,\" he said. \"I was a hero. The lights came up. The microphone got live and I was addicted to poetry from that time on.\"\nAfter graduating from Colstrip High School, he enrolled in Montana State University, where he was president of his class and earned a degree in zoology. Shortly thereafter, McRae joined the Navy, which took him to the Mediterranean and his future wife. McRae married Ruth Hayes, a nurse from Pennsylvania, in 1960. They raised one son, Clint, and two daughters, Allison and Natalie, on a cattle ranch near the one McRae's grandfather owned.\nMcRae used his affinity for speaking and writing in a variety of venues. He worked as a rodeo announcer, penned four books of poetry and one of prose, and acted, directed and wrote plays for the Coal and Cattle Country Players theater group in Colstrip.\nFor decades, he used his voice, both literally and figuratively, to advocate for family ranches and the land and water critical to them. He engaged in a protracted battle with the energy developers who sought to transform Colstrip into a sprawling industrial zone to power the country, using his poetry to describe the companies' tactics to garner access to the coal beneath ranchers' land and the landscapes and community ties at stake.\nIn 1984, McRae helped launch the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada. He became a fixture at the event, attending it every year for 35 years. In 1990, he became the first cowboy poet — and the first Montanan — to become a National Heritage Fellow, an honor presented by the Washington, D.C.,-based National Endowment for the Arts.\n\"People didn't realize it, but cowboys were one of the few surviving occupational groups that still dealt in poetry,\" he said in an interview his alma mater published in 2009. \"Sailors and loggers and farmers and military personnel all have left a history of writing poetry, but for some reason they quit. We didn't.\"\nStephanie Davis, a songwriter who first met McRae at one of the early National Cowboy Poetry Gatherings, said he may have cultivated a \"cowboy curmudgeon\" image, \"but underneath that, he was a giant marshmallow.\"\nDavis said McRae donated the National Endowment for the Arts prize money — $10,000 — to support the Montana Cowboy Poet Gathering. McRae's generosity helped Davis, who was living in Nashville at the time, return to her beloved home state of Montana to perform.\n\"I thought that was extraordinary: you win something and donate it right away to somebody else,\" she said, going on to describe him as a man who \"contained multitudes.\"\n\"I don't think he had a TV. I think he had shelves of books. He and his wife, Ruth, just read,\" Davis said. \"He was just the best of us: the best of Montana, the best poet. It's a huge loss.\"\nTeresa Erickson, a Billings resident who led the Northern Plains Resource Council from 1985 to 2019, described McRae as one of the organization's earliest and strongest advocates for family agricultural operations.\nErickson said the willingness of McRae and others to push back on mining companies' hunger for southeastern Montana coal moved the needle on several issues. Northern Plains prevailed in their nearly four-decades-long fight to stop a railroad from being built to transport Powder River Basin coal through southeastern Montana. In a similar vein, Erickson said coalbed methane production, which she described as a \"disastrous\" prospect for southeastern Montana landowners, \"never really took off in Montana\" due in part to the efforts of McRae and others.\n\"He loved Colstrip and loved eastern Montana,\" Erickson said. \"He loved the prairie very, very much and saw the beauty of it. Not everybody's like that.\"\nErickson attributes some of McRae's charisma to his voice. She said he had\n\"the quintessential Marlboro man\" voice, which may have been related, she said, to McRae's fondness for cigarettes. Erickson said McRae's integrity also made a lasting impression on her and others.\nErickson recalled McRae's confrontation with a coal company employee who'd surreptitiously squirreled away some Northern Plains-produced fact sheets ahead of a meeting with the Northern Cheyenne tribe, the Bureau of Land Management and residents impacted by nearby coal-mining operations.\n\"He stood for truly conservative principles in the purest form of what that means — and not the political sense.\"\nJim Jensen, former Montana Environmental Information Center executive director\n\"Wally just marched right up to [the coal company representative] and said, 'Give me back those fact sheets right now.' The guy denied it, and he said, 'We saw you take them.' The guy very sheepishly handed them over to him,\" Erickson recalled. \"There was just something about that act. He wasn't afraid, and he had a moral code, which was: You don't lie to people. You're honest.\"\nJim Jensen, former Montana Environmental Information Center executive director, first met McRae in the late 1970s while learning about coal development in Colstrip as a graduate student at the University of Montana. Jensen said McRae offered an eloquent \"perspective about what was before, what was coming, and what was worth saving.\"\n\"I loved Wally McRae,\" Jensen said. \"He stood for truly conservative principles in the purest form of what that means — and not the political sense.\"\nIn \"My Requiem,\" a poem McRae recited in his 2018 conversation with Hedges, he offered this aspiration:\n\"Some would build an edifice\nAn architectural gem\nTo serve throughout the ages\nAs a lasting requiem\nBut grant to me this final wish\nWhen I say that last amen\nMay my mark be carried lightly\nIn the hearts and minds of men.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "He 'loved this town': Easton community remembers Darren Foxwell\n\n July 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 720\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Inside the Easton High School auditorium on Wednesday, current and former students, teachers and community members gathered. It had barely been a month since seniors walked across the auditorium's stage, received their diplomas and turned their tassels toward the next stage of life. Wednesday's event was a sharp contrast.Family, friends and Easton High students and staff joined together to remember recent graduate Darren Foxwell at a funeral service and, later that day, a celebration of life at the Easton Volunteer Fire Department.\nThroughout the day, many remarked how kind, caring and genuine of a person Foxwell was.\nFormer Principal Sherry Spurry reflected on Foxwell's four years at Easton High while giving a eulogy at the funeral. She commended the honor roll student for his academic talents and especially emphasized his top-notch character.\n\"He was a beacon of light and joy to everyone who knew him,\" Spurry said. \"He was kind and carried a spirit that was infectious. He brought laughter and warmth to every room that he entered. His kindness had no bounds, and he had this uncanny ability to make everyone feel valued, seen and loved.\"\nOn June 17, Foxwell, 18, was a passenger in a single-car crash outside Trappe. He was transported to Shock Trauma in Baltimore for treatment of life-threatening injuries. He died the next day.\nIn the days since, family, friends and the entire Easton community have grappled with the loss of the recent graduate, also a member of the school's wrestling and lacrosse teams. This fall, Foxwell planned to attend Bethany College in West Virginia to play lacrosse.\nFormer classmates and teammates say they rarely saw Foxwell sad. He was known for his \"signature ear-to-ear grin\" — as his older sister, Colleen, said at the funeral Wednesday — and his cheerful greetings in the school hallways.\nWrestling teammate Khadija Popam, a rising sophomore, said Foxwell took time out of a free day earlier this year to watch her compete at a meet in Queen Anne's County. When she won her match, he was \"ecstatic\" for Popam, telling her to never doubt herself.\nOlder classmates and teammates were impacted by him, too. Matthew Svehla, a 2024 Easton graduate and former wrestling team captain, said Foxwell, even as a junior, made him a better leader.\n\"Without him, I wouldn't have been able to work as hard as I did,\" Svehla said.\nAt the funeral service, Foxwell's lacrosse teammates sported #17 armbands above their elbows. Hundreds attended, from family and friends to local and state elected officials.\nColleen Foxwell, Spurry and Darren's former Little League assistant coach Wade Dressler delivered speeches. Peter Hyman, rabbi emeritus at Temple B'nai Israel, officiated.\nColleen spoke about her brother's quick-witted humor and how he truly came into himself during his teenage years, growing not just tall, but confident. He was always humble, though, and would treat everyone with kindness, she said.\n\"Anyone who knows Darren and I knows we were not just brother and sister. We were best friends from the day that he was born,\" she said.\nDarren Foxwell is survived by his parents, Len Foxwell and Kerry Daly; sister, Colleen; maternal grandparents, Jerry and Linda Daly; maternal grandmother, Janice Foxwell; and aunts, uncles and cousins.\nColleen said Wednesday that the family is thankful for the community's overwhelming support.\n\"Outpour is an absolute understatement for the amount of love and support that we have felt from each and every one of you,\" she said.\nA common theme surfaced during both the funeral and the celebration of life: carrying on Darren's legacy. Spurry and Colleen Foxwell asked the Easton High School community to do just that.\n\"While we are all mourning this devastating loss of Darren today, and we will continue to for a really long time, let's remember the joy and laughter that he brought into each one of our lives,\" Spurry said. \"Let's remember the memories, appreciate the little moments and embrace life with passion.\"\n\"Help us carry on my brother's legacy,\" Colleen Foxwell said. \"Help out your neighbor, smile at a stranger, pick up a piece of trash you see on the ground, play peekaboo with the baby staring at you in the checkout line. As cliche as it sounds, do something nice when nobody's looking.\n\"My brother loved this town so much. He loved each and every one of you. And we will absolutely never forget the way that you all stood by our side.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The list of those who built this place we call home reads as a \"who's who\" of servant leaders: Nettie Jones, Shirley Gooch, Maggie Farree, Tom Hill, Mike Menzies, Bill Ryan, Richard Marks, Eric Lowery, Dick Bodorff, Blenda Armistead, Bette Kenzie, Delia Denny and so many more.Today, I want to honor the life of one of those incredible people — Ellen Rajacich — a true legend in every sense of the word.\nEllen was a YMCA volunteer for more than 50 years. She touched the lives of thousands through her group exercise classes, her time in the pool, on the water at the Tred Avon Yacht Club and her tireless service throughout our community. Her energy, warmth and passion made a lasting impact wherever she went.\nPersonally, Ellen had a profound impact on my life. Twenty years ago, as the new CEO of the YMCA of Talbot County, I was only 34 — new to the job and still learning. Ellen welcomed me with open arms and quickly showed me the importance of the work the Y, to always be ready for company and work tirelessly to improve the quality of the life of those we're fortunate enough to serve.\nAs the Y grew and I found myself in the Easton Y a little less, she always took time for me. With a warm smile and kind hug her favorite question for me was always, \"And what are we doing to take care of ourselves?\" — a gentle nudge from someone who truly cared.\nEllen embodied love, service, strength and joy. Her legacy will live on through Talbot County for generations to come.\nFair winds and following seas, Mrs. Rajacich. We'll see each other again down the road.\nROBBIE GILL\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

She was a driving force behind numerous local initiatives focused on protecting and empowering young people, and her death leaves a profound void in the community she served with compassion and resolve.Among her many roles, Wright was assistant director with the QAC Drug Free Coalition and was instrumental in forming and leading the QAC SafeHomes Program — a coalition effort among the county's health department, public schools and local organizations to prevent underage substance use. Her email address, once listed on SafeHomes materials, served as the contact point for countless families seeking guidance.\nWright was a key figure in linking school-based prevention with broader community outreach, including the Safe Youth campaign, which saw a 50 percent reduction in 30-day binge drinking rates among local students.\n\"It is going to take a coordinated school and community approach to change these established youth drinking patterns,\" Wright said at the time. \"The Drug Free Queen Anne's Coalition has been working to mobilize the community to address alcohol and other substance use for the last four years.\"\nShe co-chaired the Queen Anne's County Youth Summit and played an active role in the federally funded QAC SAFe Youth Campaign and its supporting activities, including organizing educational materials for prom and graduation, and speaking at community forums like the \"Community in Crisis\" panel in 2020.\n\"It's everyone's responsibility,\" Wright once said. \"We are asking all community members to help us reduce access. Be the wall between teens and alcohol.\"\nWright's involvement extended to the Queen Anne's County Drug-Free Coalition, where she and her husband, Warren Wright, were recognized with the Points of Light Presidential Award in 2018 for their years of work in youth drug prevention. The couple was regularly seen supporting local youth programs, including Drug-Free Student Ambassadors and the annual QAC Goes Purple campaign, a communitywide initiative for substance abuse awareness.\n\"Kathy Wright was a true champion for our community,\" said Queen Anne's County Sheriff Gary Hofmann.\n\"Her unwavering dedication to intertwining community health prevention programs with law enforcement has left a lasting impact on our community,\" Hofmann said. \"Through her efforts in addressing alcohol, tobacco, and substance use, she fostered a collaborative spirit that brought together a diverse community for the greater good.\"\nThe sheriff said that Wright's vision and commitment to prevention empowered individuals and strengthened the community's resolve to face challenging issues in partnership with the Sheriff's Office.\n\"She will be deeply missed, but her legacy of compassion and partnership will continue to inspire us all,\" he said\nJulie Kille, opioid education and prevention coordinator for Queen Anne's County Public Schools, reflected on her colleague's influence.\n\"It is with heavy hearts that we remember and honor the life of a remarkable individual, Kathy Wright,\" Kille said. \"Her legacy will continue to shine brightly in the lives she touched.\"\nCalling Wright's commitment \"powerful and profoundly effective,\" Kille called her friend \"a guiding light for youth and families across our county.\"\n\"For years, she dedicated herself to educating others about the dangers of substance abuse, never wavering in her mission to protect and uplift the next generation,\" she said. \"To so many, Kathy was not just an advocate, she was a friend. She saw people, truly saw them, and made them feel valued. Her warm presence, her steadfast belief in the good of others, and her ability to lift people up will be sorely missed.\"\nWright's work touched every corner of Queen Anne's County — from school hallways to government panels — and her legacy continues in the lives she helped shape and the programs she helped build.\nInformation on services will be shared when available. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was 84.\nOne story stood out in my mind. It was a story that told about Blessing, but it also told about his wife's dedication to and love of her husband.\nDonna was in labor with the couple's youngest child, Billy. It was July 7, 1980, and Eddy was being sworn in as police chief. The town moved his swearing-in up to the start of the meeting that evening.

Edward \"Eddy\" Blessing for his lifelong commitment to family, law enforcement and the town.Blessing, Easton's eighth police chief, died Aug. 17. He was 84.\nBlessing spent 31 years at the Easton Police Department, the place he started his law enforcement career in 1964. He was appointed chief in 1980 and led the agency for 15 years.\nHis wife, Donna, fondly recalled her husband's swearing-in ceremony on July 7, 1980. She was \"nine months-plus pregnant\" with their youngest child, Billy.\nThe town moved his swearing-in up to the start of the meeting that evening since Donna was in labor. Blessing was sworn in, and they quickly departed for the hospital.\n\"I was already in labor, but I refused to miss it,\" Donna said.\nBilly was born around 7 a.m. the next morning. Blessing's family said such moments showed just how dedicated he was to both family and the police department.\n\"That's one of a thousand examples over the course of his life that just shows that balance of the commitment to what he loved job-wise and everything he loved police-wise,\" said oldest son, Steve Repetti.\nBlessing retired from the Easton Police Department in 1995. He came out of retirement to serve as chief deputy at the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, where he retired from in 2002.\nGreg Wright, Easton's current deputy chief, was hired by Blessing in 1987. Wright described Blessing as a true professional and his \"first cheerleader.\"\n\"He had a lot of respect in his agency and his staff,\" Wright said.\nBlessing spearheaded the creation of an evidence collection unit and the modern-era bike patrol, Wright said.\n\"He really pushed the department to be bigger than what it was as he became chief,\" the deputy chief said.\nWright said Blessing had a significant presence in the community after his retirement as police chief. Blessing was \"very proud of the people he hired, and more proud when they succeeded,\" Wright said.\nBlessing spearheaded Talbot County's Drug Abuse Resistance Education program, which is still active within the sheriff's office today.\nOutside of police work, Blessing was often recognized and respected walking around town or dining in local restaurants, close family said. This week, the family has heard from many in the community who were positively impacted by Blessing's time coaching soccer teams in Talbot County and at the Easton Little League.\nA few years ago, Blessing was in Talbot Hospice after surgery, Billy said. The team at Talbot Hospice was \"phenomenal,\" he added.\nBlessing fought through his health conditions and returned home for around another 2½ years, a sign of his \"tough\" and fighting spirit, Billy said.\nIn addition to his wife, Donna, Blessing is survived by four children: Steve Repetti, Robin O'Brien, Stacie Johnson and Billy Blessing. He is also survived by seven grandchildren, as well as two great-grandchildren and one more on the way.\nStacie Johnson said she and Robin, both grandparents, are now singing the same songs to their grandchildren as their father did to them. Blessing's family said he was a great police officer, dad and husband — and especially an amazing grandfather.\n\"He loved the Town of Easton so much and was so proud to be the chief,\" Donna said. \"His family was extremely important to him, all of his children and grandchildren.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From the courtroom to the Chesapeake, 'The Judge' leaves a lasting legacy\n\n September 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 806\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — John North was more than just a well-respected judge.The former Talbot County state's attorney and judge of the District and Circuit courts wore many hats during his professional and retired life, serving as a protector of the Chesapeake Bay, log canoe racing aficionado and vintage automobile enthusiast.\nIn recent days, family, friends and the Talbot County community have remembered North for his roles in all of those capacities and more.\nNorth died in St. Michaels on Sept. 19. He was 94.\nOldest son David North remembered his father as \"competitive with compassion.\" He was supportive and thorough in everything he did, his son said.\n\"Right through the end, he was showing us how to have fun under not very good circumstances and how to stay competitive,\" David North said. \"And how to laugh.\"\nNorth was Talbot County state's attorney from 1962 to 1971. He then served as judge for 12 years in District Court and five years in Circuit Court before his appointment as the first chairman of the Maryland Critical Area Commission, the state agency responsible for protecting the health of the Chesapeake Bay and enforcing laws at a local level.\nPete Lesher, current Talbot County Council vice president, reflected on North's impact with the commission and as one of the founders of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in the 1960s.\n\"He lived and played on Chesapeake waters,\" said Lesher, also the museum's chief historian. \"He valued the health of these waters and I think relished that role of caring for them in the capacity of the Critical Area regulation.\"\nRen Serey, former executive director of the Critical Area Commission, worked closely with North for many years. \"The Judge,\" as North was widely known, brought the necessary judicial expertise and temperament to chair the commission, Serey said.\nNorth was responsible for implementing local critical area programs at a time when the Bay's environmental needs clashed with rural growth and development patterns, Serey said. But North struck the perfect balance in adjudicating such matters.\n\"Having Judge North up there at the head of the table facing 29 people who were debating these issues was just the perfect role for him,\" Serey said. \" ... He knew how to listen, he knew how to interject, he knew how to keep the discussion without certain boundaries.\"\nThose that worked closely with North said he was widely trusted for his fairness and loyalty.\nLesher recalled a time in the early 2000s when the state committed funds for repairs to the Chesapeake Bay's skipjack fleet. But the state didn't fully lay out how the money would be doled out among skipjack captains in Tilghman Island and Deal Island.\nJudge North, though, stepped in.\n\"Who was going to be the trusted arbiter if it came down to a Deal Island versus Tilghman Island? It was Judge North,\" Lesher said. \"He was trusted by these watermen.\"\nNorth's wife of 64 years, Ethel Towers North, died in 2019. He is survived by sons David and Daniel and their wives Joan Hoge-North and Margaret Enloe-North, along with grandchildren Drew North, Dylan North, Campbell North, William Spencer North and Nathaniel Vivian, and former daughters-in-law, Sallie North and Carrington North. He is also survived by Comber McHugh, a companion of later years.\nIn addition to his esteemed roles with the courts and the Critical Area Commission, North was a local log canoe captain. He wrote a book on sailing log canoes, which was published by the Maritime Museum in 2018.\n\"The Judge\" skippered Island Bird, the 27-foot-4-inch log canoe built by North's great-grandfather in 1882.\nDavid North said his younger brother Daniel took up his dad's sailing hobby. They both have kids who continue sailing on the Chesapeake Bay.\n\"It's a piece of our family. It's a piece of our heritage,\" David North said.\nIn his spare time, \"The Judge\" was a lover of feral cats, a keen reader and a sculptor. Some of his sculpting works are displayed at The Trippe Gallery in Easton.\nDavid North said he followed his dad's footsteps in the world of automobile restoration and car shows. Judge North especially loved Bugattis and Duesenbergs.\nNorth was a founder of the St. Michaels Concours d'Elegance, an annual car showcase nearing its 20-year mark. Luke Phipps, the festival's current chair, said it began as simply an oyster roast at North's house in St. Michaels, where friends of \"The Judge\" would bring their vintage cars to his front lawn. Then, the tradition grew into a solidified event.\nThe 18th St. Michaels Concours d'Elegance was hosted Sept. 26-28 at the Kent Island Yacht Club. Despite heavy rain the night before the festival's last hurrah on Sept. 28, Phipps said it was a \"beautiful\" and sunny Sunday.\nPhipps said all he could think of was North — a close friend and valuable mentor — smiling down on Sunday.\nHe recalled North as a \"sharp\" and an \"eloquently spoken\" man.\n\"There'll never be another one like him,\" Phipps said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
