    "content": "Grains of Rice - India's export ban, climate impacts stir food security worries, but offer opportunities for rice farmers\n\n August 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; Apg National Enterprise Editor | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 1112\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Rice - a primary staple food for more than 3.5 billion people worldwide and a $365.6 billion agricultural industry and food business - faces uncertainty with prices, farm production and supplies that could have ramifications worldwide as well as for U.S. consumers and farmers.India, the world's top rice exporter, is cutting off its outgoing trade for non-basmati rice over concerns about inflation and food insecurity with national elections looming next year.El Nino weather conditions have created droughts and warmer temperatures negatively impacting rice production in parts of Asia - which produces 90% of annual crops. That's impacted crops in markets such as Vietnam and Thailand.\"Asia has had supply concerns due to their El Nino conditions and uneven rainfall,\" said Michael Deliberto, an agriculture professor with Louisiana State University, who expects upward price pressures on rice to materialize with India's export ban on non-basmati varieties.'The cheapest game in town' India previously put a stop to rice exports in 2007 and 2008.But this stoppage comes at a time when there are worries about increased food insecurity as well as the impacts of high inflation levels across the globe after all the monetary infusions of the corona virus pandemic. Rice consumption is also projected to crease 25% over the next 25 years driven by projected population gains in South Asia and other regions, according to S & P Global Commodity Insights.\"They control about 40% of global exports in rice,\" Deliberto said, noting that India's top export markets include China as well as other developing South Asian and African countries who rely on the staple food.\"That can kind of ramp up food security issues globally.\" Higher rice prices and supply chains could magnify food insecurity issues in poorer regions, including in some international hotspots, already dealing with high inflation and the impacts on grain and fertilizers of Russia's war in Ukraine. The United Nations estimates last year 258 million people in 58 counties faced \"acute food insecurity\" or worse, up from 193 million in 2021.Deliberto said other rice-producing countries, including the U.S, either don't have the growing capacity or don't always produce rice at the price points for poorer markets. Rice is grown in irrigated and flooded fields.\"No other single country could just step up - maybe China,\" Deliberto said. China is the world's largest producer of rice but it is mostly for domestic consumption.\"It was the cheapest game in town,\" he said of India's offerings.'It's more of rollercoaster' U.S. farmers export long-grain rice to Latin America and the Caribbean as well as more higher-end products to Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia.The U.S. rice market - which totals $6.65 billion, according to New York-based research firm Statista Inc. - is dwarfed by other crops.Deliberto said there are approximately 30 million acres of U.S. farmland used for water-heavy rice production compared to 90 million acres planted for corn and 85 million acres for soybeans. U.S. rice growers frequently compete more with Brazilian growers aiming to supply Latin American and Caribbean markets.Water and drought issues in the U.S. - as well as market dynamics that make other crops more lucrative - limit expansion of domestic rice farming. Droughts and warmer temperatures in northern California have impacted rice production levels.\"Water availability is the biggest limitation on expanding rice production,\" Deliberto said.Arkansas is the top U.S. rice producer with some of the other main farming areas along the Mississippi River Delta, the Gulf coast of Texas and Louisiana and California's Sacramento Valley.Kenneth Graves, chairman of the Arkansas Rice Growers Association and a longtime rice farmer, said certain types of clay soils - which are found in parts of Arkansas and along the Mississippi River are also more conducive to rice growing than other soils in the U.S.\"It's all dependent on your ground,\" said Graves.Graves said India's export ban impacts a large chunk of global rice supplies. \"That's going to be huge,\" he said.But that is part of some market fluctuations - including those due to weather and climate changes - that have recently impacted rice farmers in California as well as international markets.Graves said weather, water and the international breadth and depth of the rice marketplace can make for more fluctuations than other crops.The global rice marketplace is projected to grow from its current $365.6 billion level to $423.8 billion by 2028, according Modor Intelligence, an India-based research firm \"It's more of a roller coaster compared to other crops,\" Graves said.Consumer impacts?For U.S. consumers, India's current export prohibitions and climate and weather impacts on other rice producers, including Vietnam and Thailand could also mean different offerings and price changes at supermarkets in the U.S. as well as some potential opportunities for American rice growers.The U.S. imports 13% of its rice annually, according to the USDA.Popular basmati rice comes from India as well as rival Pakistan - which is seeing increased demand and higher prices for its crops.According to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), 58.6% of U.S. rice imports come from Thailand followed by 22.1% from India, 3.7% Pakistan and 2.7% from China.U.S. rice farmers grow less than 2% of the world's rice but account for 5% of total global exports. The U.S. is the fifth largest rice export in the world with $1.68 billion worth of domestically grown rice shipped to Japan, Haiti, Mexico, South Korea, Colombia and Saudi Arabia, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.While India's current export ban could impact how grocery chains and restaurants source their rice., 80% of the rice consumed in the U.S. is grown domestically, according to the USA Rice Federation.Rice prices are up 7.1% compared to last year, according to the latest Consumer Price Index. That is compared to an overall 3% inflation rate and a 4.7% inflation rate for food.A number of major grocery chains contacted for this story did not respond to questions about any impacts they are seeing on prices and inventories for rice. There have been some reports of U.S. consumers bolstering their rice supplies after India announced its export ban last month.Figure G.

    "content": "Farm family continues after five generations\n\n August 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 1145\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Bobby and Connie Wilson have a long farm family history in Queen Anne's County spanning over 100 years.The Wilson family has owned land in Queen Anne's County since the early 1900s, they purchased the \"home\" farm in 1916.Both Bobby and Connie grew up in Queen Anne's County and went to school together.In 1916 Bobby's great grandparents purchased \"Shall Cross Farm.\" In 1918 Bobby's grandparents William and Gladys bought \"Shall Cross Farm\" from their parents for $500 and the remaining value of the farm was gifted as a wedding dowery. Bobby grew up working on their family farm until he graduated from high school, and his father sold the home farm.Bobby went to work after graduation, he worked at several different jobs, working on a farm in Queenstown that raised hogs, Wye Mills grain, as a equipment mechanic, at John Deere as an equipment manager, drove a truck, worked as a marine pile driver all while helping his uncle farm part-time.Bobby remembers working with mules pulling a walking cultivator, when they did purchase a tractor, they had no cabs.\"Working on tractors with no cabs was terrible, you would get off the tractor and your face would be covered in dirt,\" Bobby said.Connie's family, the Richard sons, owned their family farm near Conquest beach since the 1900s. Connie was the oldest of three children, she had to help her mother with turkeys. Her mother raised around 500 turkeys which helped with extra family income. Connie had to shoot predators and keep the turkeys safe. She helped feed them and when the turkeys were big enough Connie would help dress them and her mother would take them to Baltimore and PA to sell.When Connie's mother was traveling to sell her turkeys, it was Connie's job to take care of her younger siblings along with working on the farm.Bobby remembers seeing Connie as a teenager, he asked his good friend Charles Haymaker, \"Who is that?\" Charles told him Connie was out of his league. Charles bet Bobby $5, which was a lot of money, at that time, he couldn't get a date with Connie. After a couple of months of asking they finally went on a date to the Church Hill drive-in movies. As both Bobby and Connie said, \"The rest is history.\" They got married in 1955, they just celebrated their 68th wedding anniversary.They were blessed with three children, Marion, Robbie and Lynn. Bobby was an only child just like his father, when Bobby called his mother to tell her Lynn was born, she thought Bobby was lying. Lynn was the first girl in six generations to be born into the Wilson family. They moved six times during their marriage and never once moved out of Queen Anne's County.Bobby and Connie purchased \"Shell cross Farm\", in 1971 from his grandmother and returned to farming full time. The name \"Shell cross Farm\" had morphed over the years from \"Shall Cross Farm\" to \"Shell cross Farm.\" Bobby and his son, Marion, raised swine for 10 years and at their peak farmed around 2,500 acres of land.During the same time that Bobby was farming full time Connie had her own cosmetology business for 22 years.Connie would attend to University of Maryland in College Park for a period of seven years to get her cosmetology degree. After she would finish her classes in College Park she would come home and work ground and plant in the evenings.She began her teaching career at the Queen Anne's County High School, it was supposed to be for a year or two and after 27 years she finally retired.Connie would plant, take care of her kids as well as bringing meals to Bobby in the field.\"There is always something to do on the farm,\" Connie smiled.Bobby and Connie's grandson, Marion, started working on the farm at age 14, he always knew he wanted to farm. Bobby and Connie both told Marion he can work on the farm full time after graduation with one stipulation, he had to go to college. Marion was reluctant, however, he said \"it was the best thing he did.\" College taught him how manage a business and interact with people in the ag community. Marion and his wife Amy purchased Shell cross farms in 2013 and moved to the farm in 2016.In 2000, the farming operation was turned over to Marion and Amy full time. Marion had been his grandfather's shadow since he was 5 years old.\"I got my work ethic and experience from Pop and Mom-Mom,\" he said. \"She taught me how to drive the tractors on the farm. That was her job to drive tractors while Pop was away doing his community service.\" Bobby and Connie both set an example of giving back to the community.Bobby has been on the local and State Farm Bureau board, served on the local and State Soil Conservation District Board for 31 years, he was the state President for Maryland Farm Bureau and Maryland Association of Soil Conservation Districts, Queen Anne's County Lions Club, Jaycees, served in the Army National Guard for 12 years, served on the board of Centreville United Methodist Church, volunteered at the Queen Anne's County Fair cooking barbeque chicken for at least 25 years with Paul Gunther.Connie, as well, has given back to the community being the class adviser at Queen Anne's County High School, Vocational Industries Clubs of America (VICA) for 16 years, 4-H Club leader, Boy and Girl Scout leader, Maryland Agricultural Education Foundation board member, Junior Women's Club member who sponsored a fair every year to provide free kindergarten classes for 10 years prior to Kindergarten being a part of the school curriculum.They would have booths to raise money and each year a new booth was added to make sure sufficient funding for kindergarten was provided for the children in the county.When asked, Bobby said, \"one of his favorite jobs was working as the service manager for John Deere.\" He liked managing the 10 men under him. He and Connie mentioned before they had irrigation \"Mother Nature isn't always so kind to farmers and that was the hardest part of farming. Not knowing if you're going to get the rain you need to grow a crop.\" The Wilsons want to be remembered for their family heritage and what they have contributed to the ag community.Their five grandchildren are a source of joy for them and their great-grandchildren growing up on the farm and showing interest in the family farm is gratifying.Their great-grandchildren, Colton and Ellie, both acknowledge that their great-grandparents are modest in what they say they have done in their lifetimes. One thing is for sure they have passed their farm family heritage through more than five generations. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED.\n \nThe Wilson family includes, back row, Ellie Wilson, Marion Wilson, Amy Wilson and Colton Wilson.

    "content": "It's peach picking time - FROM PEACH PIE TO HAM WITH PEACH GLAZE, THIS FRUIT IS VERSATILE\n\n August 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Marie Savage; The Country Cook | Page: 18 | Section: News \n \n 2073\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The peach adventure has arrived locally. Check your local newspaper to locate the u-pick locations and produce stands featuring local peaches.Some prefer to pick their own and others simply get them from local stores or produce stands. No matter where or how you get them. enjoy this delicious fruit.Growing up in a family that harvested, froze, or canned whatever was in season I always enjoyed peach canning time because I knew the \"season\" was finally coming to an end and the canning and freezing equipment could be \"retired\" to the storage space until apple picking time!Mom always waited until late July and into August to begin the \"peach adventure\". The day of peach picking always seemed to be very hot. We would leave early in the morning and get home by lunchtime. due to the heat and crowded orchards. Mom always carried plenty of water and light snacks. We loaded the pickup with plenty of containers to store the peaches. we never stacked the baskets or wooden crates higher than 14 inches per container to avoid bruising the peaches.Upon arriving home we laid down newspapers to separate the peaches individually. The bruised or mushy fruit was washed, peeled and eaten immediately and made into pies, ice cream or toppings for our cereal or just \"sugared down.\" The firm fruit was used within a couple of days for canning and freezing.Yes. this involved a lot of work being shared by all who would enjoy the peach jelly, jams, canned peaches, frozen peach slices for baking those peach pies and that awesome homemade peach ice cream, peach muffins, peach cobbler and whatever else Mom decided to make.Let's get cooking!COUNTRY PEACH PIEFor the crust: 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, 2 tablespoons sugar, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces. For the filling: 4 pounds peaches peeled and cut into wedges, 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar,. cup all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice,. teaspoon ground cardamom,. teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces and 1 large egg. Make the crust: pulse flour, sugar and salt in a food processor. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like a coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter.Add. cup ice water and pulse until the dough just starts to come together. Divide the dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and form each into a disk; wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour.Make the filling: toss the peaches in a bowl with 3/4 cup sugar, the flour, lemon juice and spices. Lightly dust a large piece of parchment paper with flour. Roll out 1 piece of the dough into a 12-inch round on the parchment.Ease the dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Add the filling, mounding it slightly in the center; dot with the butter and refrigerate. Roll out the second piece of dough into a 12-inch round and cut it into. inch-wide strips. Lay half of the strips on the pie in one direction, leaving about 1 inch of space between each strip. Lay the remaining strips on top, crossing them diagonally to make a lattice pattern (no need to weave); trim the edges of the strips, leaving a small overhang. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edge of the crust with your fingers.Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush on the crust edge and lattice top. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.Position a rack in the lower third of the oven. Put a baking sheet on the rack and preheat to 425 degrees F. Put the pie on the hot baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and continue baking until the pie is golden and the filling is bubbly, 50 minutes to 1 hour. (Cover loosely with foil if the top is browning too quickly.) Transfer to a rack to cool completely before slicing.SOUTHERN PEACH COBBLER8 fresh peaches. peeled, pitted and sliced into thin wedges,. cup white sugar,. cup brown sugar,. teaspoon ground cinnamon,. teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, 2 teaspoons cornstarch, 1 cup all-purpose flour,. cup white sugar,. cup brown sugar, 1 teaspoon baking powder,. teaspoon salt, 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces,. cup boiling water.Mix together 3 tablespoons white sugar and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine peaches,. cup white sugar,. cup brown sugar,. teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Toss to coat evenly and pour into a 2-quart baking dish. Bake in a preheated oven for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine flour,. cup white sugar,. cup brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Blend in butter with your fingertips, or a pastry blender, until mixture resembles coarse meal.Stir in water until just combined.Remove peaches from the oven and drop spoonfuls of topping over them.Sprinkle the entire cobbler with the sugar and cinnamon mixture. Bake until the topping is golden, about 30 minutes.PEACH PANCAKES1 cup white flour, 1. teaspoons baking powder,. teaspoon ground cinnamon,. teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon butter melted, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract,. cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt,. cup milk,. cup finely diced peaches, or more if you like a lot of peaches.Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together the butter and vanilla. Mix in the Greek yogurt, stirring until no large lumps remain. If the butter is still lumpy, briefly microwave the mixture for 10-15 seconds. Alternate between adding the flour mixture and the milk, beginning, and ending with the flour, stirring just until incorporated. Gently fold in the peaches.Lightly coat a large nonstick pan or griddle with nonstick cooking spray and preheat over low heat. Using 2 tablespoons of batter for each pancake, dollop the batter onto the hot pan and spread into a circular shape if desired. Let the pancakes cook for 2-3 minutes, or until a slight skin starts to form around the edges and the bottom is light golden brown.Slide a spatula underneath and flip.Continue to cook for another 1-2 minutes or until light golden brown on both sides. Remember to recoat the pan with nonstick cooking spray before cooking the next round of pancake batter. Top the pancakes with pure maple syrup, if desired.Here is one from way back. Hot summer days canning on the farm made for sweet lunches in the fall and winter.PEACH JAM3. pounds peaches (1 pound = 3 to 4 medium peaches), peeled, pitted, and cut into chunks, 2. cups sugar.You can start with less sugar and add more if needed, but don't add too little or your jam won't gel. Juice from one lemon, Lemon juice is naturally high in pectin and will help the jam set. Add peaches and lemon juice to a medium saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, using a spatula or masher to crush peaches to desired consistency.Reduce heat to medium. Add sugar. Bring peaches back to a boil, stirring frequently. Continue to boil and stir, until peaches reduce and reach desired consistency. (Anywhere from 15 to 25 minutes. jam should stick to spoon when lifted and turned sideways.) Let the peach preserves cool, if you find the jam is not at the consistency you desire, you can bring the peaches back to boiling for about 10 minutes and then let it cool again.Sterilize the jars and lids. Whatever size you like. (I prefer the 8 oz. jars for this recipe.)Add the peach jam to the jar, leaving. inch headspace. Use a skinny spatula to help remove air pockets.Wipe down jar rims and add the lids.Seal to fingertip tightness. (Screw on till you feel resistance. Too loose, jar won't seal, too tight air won't release properly.) Process for 5 minutes in the boiling water. Turn off the heat and let the jars sit in the water for another 5 minutes. Remove jars and let cool for 12 to 24 hours. Check the seal by removing the band and pressing the center of each lid. If you can indent the lid, your jam did not seal properly. Store in a cool dry location for one year for best quality, but may be good for up to two years. Be sure to test your jar for spoilage before using it.In the 1950s and '60s, fruited seltzers became very popular social drinks. Here is one of my favorite fruit seltzers.PEACH SODA SELTZER1 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger, 2 very ripe peaches (about. pound), halved, pitted, and thinly sliced, 2 liters seltzer, chilled, 16 fresh mint leaves, for garnish. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, bring 1 cup water, sugar, and ginger to a gentle simmer, stirring to dissolve sugar. Remove simple syrup from heat, cover, and steep for about 30 minutes. Over a medium bowl, pour syrup through a fine mesh sieve, pressing minced ginger against the sieve with the back of a spoon to extract flavor. Discard ginger. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled. Evenly distribute peach slices among 8 tall glasses.For each glass, lightly press peaches with the back of a wooden spoon to release their juice. Pour about 2 tablespoons of chilled syrup over peaches.(Store remaining syrup in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.) Add ice cubes; then top with seltzer. Stir to distribute syrup, peach juice, and seltzer evenly. Garnish with 2 mint leaves.PEACH BUTTER15 ripe peaches, 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon,. teaspoon cloves, 1/8 teaspoon allspice, 4 teaspoons lemon juice, 1. cups granulated sugar. Bring a pot of water to a boil, and place peaches in the water for 1 minute. This works better if you're using ripe peaches that are ready to eat.Using a slotted spoon, place the peaches into a bowl of ice water for 2 minutes. Then, slide the skins off.Cut the peaches into slices, and place in a blender. Blend until smooth.Place the pureed peaches and lemon juice into your crock pot, stir, and then top with cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and sugar.Cook on low until it reaches the thickness you want, 4-6 hours is typically good, although it may take longer.After 4 hours, to speed up the thickening process you can pop the lid off the crock pot just a crack to allow a little steam to escape. Used half-pint jars, and left about an inch at the top. Keep the lids in hot water until ready to use.Once the jars are filled with peach butter, put the hot lids on them and place them in a hot water bath. I make sure the jars are covered by an inch or two of boiling water, and let them cook for 15 minutes. Lift the jars out of the boiling water, preferably with one of these nifty gadgets, and let them cool overnight so the jars aren't touching. You can make sure they sealed correctly by pressing your fingers on the lid. If it doesn't pop up and down, you're golden.HAM WITH PEACH GLAZEPlace one bone-in fully cooked ham on a rack in a roaster. Place two 8 ounce cans of sliced pineapple on top of ham and score the ham with whole cloves, making sure you push the cloves in tightly to hold the pineapple slices. Add maraschino cherries with stems. Secure cherries with toothpicks.In a small bowl mix combine 1. cups packed brown sugar,. cup peach nectar, 3 tablespoons cider vinegar and. teaspoon ground cloves.Mix well and spoon half of the mixture over the ham. Cover ham and bake at 350 degrees for two hours.Uncover the ham and bake 20 more minutes longer and at this point baste ham with remaining glaze.PEACH COBBLERPeel and slice enough fresh peaches to equal 4 cups. In a 2 quart baking dish melt enough butter to equal. cup. Mix. cup flour,. cup sugar, 1 teaspoon baking powder, and. cup milk. Mix well. Place batter in a baking dish and then peach slices over the batter. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes. Easy to make and delicious.PEACH PIEPrepare and bake one 9-inch pie shell and let it cool. Combine 1 cup sugar, 3 tablespoons cornstarch, and a dash of salt in a saucepan. Stir in. cup water and 3 fresh peaches that have been peeled and mashed. Cook over medium heat stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes or until mixture is smooth and thickened. Cool. Place 4 more peaches, peeled and sliced, into the pastry shell. Pour the cooled peach mixture over top of the sliced peaches. Chill 2 hours in the refrigerator and then serve with Cool Whip topping. \n \n Caption: Peach pie makes a perfect summer dessert. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If it wasn't for shows like this, they wouldn't have a clue about (farming heritage).\" There was something for everyone in the large flea market with more than 125 dealers. One of them was Skyler Golt, owner of Saxton Essentials, who sold handmade crafts with materials collected from local beaches.\"This is my first show as a vendor,\" Golt said. \"I grew up on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and always came to the Threshermen's show, and I am so happy to be here.

The objective of the MPILP is to strengthen the financing capacity for small-and midsized independent meat processors, and to create a more resilient, diverse, and secure U.S. food supply chain.MARBIDCO is supplementing the USDA grant with another $1.3 million of its own funds to establish a special pool of lending capital of approximately $5 million.The Maryland Livestock Processing Loan Fund is designed to assist with the expansion of livestock and blue catfish processing capacity in Maryland. Farmers raising cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs still are facing very long lead times to get their animals processed, while blue catfish is an invasive fish species in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries that is having a very detrimental impact on other species of fish and shellfish. Increasing commercial harvest and consumption of these catfish is one way to significantly reduce their numbers.Businesses engaged in the processing of livestock, or the invasive blue catfish can apply for a Maryland Livestock Processing Loan, which may also include an equity incentive grant of up to 10% of the project cost. Loan and grant proceeds can be used to purchase livestock processing and cold storage equipment, build or upgrade meat processing facilities, as well as purchase real estate on which the livestock processing activity will occur.MARBIDCO's Livestock Processing Loan Fund can offer standalone financing or work in conjunction with other financing provided by commercial lenders.\"This should be an incredible win for Maryland. The addition of new or significantly expanded meat processing facilities will positively impact many people within the food supply chain, from farmers and commercial fisherman to consumer's tables with these locally produced protein products,\" said MARBIDCO Executive Director Steve McHenry. \"We are delighted to be a USDA grant recipient, and we want to thank the Maryland Department of Agriculture and our State's entire Congressional Delegation for their support of our application in what was a very competitive nationwide process.\" Loan amounts can range from a minimum of $250,000 up to a maximum of $2,500,000. MARBIDCO will charge a below-market fixed interest rate of 4% and will work cooperatively with borrowers on establishing other appropriate loan terms and conditions.An equity contribution of at least 7.5% of a project's total cost is required by the borrower (which can be matched dollar-for-dollar with a grant, not to exceed 10% of the project's total cost). The available equity grant match is coming from special funds appropriated to MARBIDCO by the State of Maryland to help enhance livestock processing capacity and cut down on long wait times.Further information and the program application form is available on MARBIDCO's website: www. marbidco.org. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY CONNIE CONNOLLY\n \nBlue catfish fillets await skinning at the only USDA processing facility on the Eastern Shore. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The easements will permanently preserve 1,400 acres of prime farmland in Baltimore, Charles, Dorchester, Frederick, Garrett, Queen Anne's, Washington and Wicomico counties, for an investment of more than $8 million.\"Keeping farming viable in Maryland starts with preserving farmland,\" said Maryland Department of Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks. \"Fortunately, Maryland has one of the most successful agricultural land preservation programs in the country. And with these additional easements being approved, 1,400 more acres are secured for the purpose of providing food and fiber to the region.\" Easements approved on the Mid-Shore include two farms in Dorchester, totaling 84.10 acres, at a cost of $396,750, and one farm in Queen Anne's, 197.08 acres, at a cost of $740,455.42.The Maryland Agricultural Preservation Foundation was established in 1977 as part of the Maryland Department of Agriculture. The foundation purchases agricultural preservation easements from willing farmers to forever protect prime farmland and woodland.The newly approved easements will help the state meet its Chesapeake Bay goal of conserving and preserving over 1 million acres of productive agricultural land by 2030. \n \n Caption: KEVIN ATTICKS Kevin Atticks \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

ACT argued that the permit didn't do enough to regulate ammonia emissions from farms, and said MDE should go much further, possibly even requiring farm-byfarm installation of expensive new equipment. A Montgomery County judge sided with ACT in March 2021, ordering MDE to rewrite the permit with stricter standards, but MDE appealed that decision, and the Maryland Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal.When ACT filed its petition and the Montgomery County judge granted it, Delmarva Chicken Association recognized this case could have serious implications for chicken growers and the chicken community as a whole. To advocate for members in the closely-watched legal fight, DCA filed a friend-of-the-court brief arguing ACT's reading of the law was wrong, and that the MDE-approved permit was in line with federal law governing farms and clean water regulations.\"We're glad the Maryland Supreme Court recognized this challenge to the 2019 permit lacked merit and mischaracterized the law,\" said Holly Porter, DCA's executive director. \"This is the third consecutive time these activists have tried and failed to persuade courts to overrule science-based, legally sound water quality regulations.\" ACT, the court said, failed to show MDE's decision-making around the CAFO permit was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" In fact, the court's opinion said, Maryland regulators designed \"the same general discharge permit framework established by federal regulations,\" and so the court has no reason to upend it through judicial review.On the matter of ammonia emissions, the court found Maryland's permit sufficiently controlled ammonia pollution through site-specific measures when MDE found they would be called for, and adherence to best management practices required by the general permit.ACT's argument otherwise \"is in direct conflict with the evidence in the administrative record,\" the court ruled.The court ruling comes as agricultural stakeholders in the Chesapeake Bay watershed have reduced their annual nutrient inputs to the Bay, eliminating 39 million pounds of nitrogen and 3.5 million pounds of phosphorus since 1985. Developed areas like cities and suburbs, meanwhile, have increased their annual nutrient contributions to the watershed.In 1985, developed areas were responsible for an estimated 15% of nitrogen loads to the Bay; in 2021, they were responsible for an estimated 26% of the Bay's nitrogen pollution.The opinion in Maryland Department of the Environment v. Assateague Coastal Trust was written by Justice Brynja M. Booth, who has served on Maryland's highest court since 2019. It's the third time in recent years ACT has mounted a failed challenge to the MDE general discharge permit; a previous effort to overturn the 2009 permit was \"rejected at all levels,\" the court noted in Wednesday's opinion, and a challenge to the 2014 permit was also turned back by the courts. \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nThe court ruling comes as agricultural stakeholders in the Chesapeake Bay watershed have reduced their annual nutrient inputs to the Bay, eliminating 39 million pounds of nitrogen and 3.5 million pounds of phosphorus since 1985.\n \nHOLLY PORTER \n \n Memo: \"We're glad the Maryland Supreme Court recognized this challenge to the 2019 permit lacked merit and mischaracterized the law.

    "content": "Field to Table event highlights ag entrepreneurs - QUEEN ANNE's COUNTY\n\n August 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A5 | Section: News \n \n 796\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE - In June, Queen Anne's County Economic & Tourism Development hosted its first Field to Table event celebrating small agricultural entrepreneurs.For the last three years, the department has supported over 25 local agricultural businesses by providing micro grants of up to $10,000 to assist with marketing, implementing capital improvement projects, and/or conducting research through a grant fund made possible by Upper Shore Regional Council and the Queen Anne's County Commissioners.The Field to Table event showcased the grantees' products and connected the ag entrepreneurs with local business and community leaders.\"We're incredibly proud of the fact that Queen Anne's County has a thriving ecosystem of farmers and producers that are creating such unique, accessible, high-quality products,\" said Rebecca Clark, the county's Economic Development Coordinator. \"What better way to celebrate them than to give our local business and community leaders the opportunity to hear their stories, sample their products, and enjoy a thoughtfully curated dinner made with products they cultivated or produced? Every one of the grantees participating tonight and the local businesses we brought in to make the evening special are contributing to the economic vitality of Queen Anne's County. They each play a role in making it a better place to live.\" Several of the grantees have developed partnerships with one another, resulting in a multiplier effect of the funding they received.One such partnership is between Oksana Bocharaova of Oksana's Produce Farm in Chestertown and David King of King Mushrooms of Marydel. King is able to use space in Oksana's commercial kitchen to produce value-added products that he can take to his thriving farmers market circuit, and for a small fee this access offsets a portion of Bocharaova's cost to lease the commercial space.The county's five breweries - Big Truck Farm Brewery, Bull & Goat Brewery, Cult Classic, Patriot Acres Farm Brewery, and Ten Eyck Brewing - recently joined forces to share knowledge and resources as the Queen Anne's County Brewers Coalition. The group used their most recent micro grant to collectively educate county residents and beyond about the history of breweries and the science of alcohol manufacturing through marketing of their Hop On: QAC Brewery Tour.\"This partnership and the ability to get to work with all of these different people and organizations has created something that not a lot of others can say they have. Queen Anne's County is really unique,\" said Jacob Heimbuch, co-owner of Bull & Goat Brewing and Old Courthouse Distillery.The ag entrepreneurs and their products featured at the Field to Table event included: Blue Heron Farm (strawberry jam), King Mushrooms LLC (Lions Mane mushrooms and tinctures), Mindful Acres (microgreens), Oksana's Produce Farm (carrots and pickles), Quillen Farms (wagyu beef), SunKissed Flower Farm (flowers for the tables and an makeyour-own bouquet station), Tidewater Organics (flour for dinner rolls), Tomahawk Farms (flowers and jam), Where Pigs Fly Farm (chicken, eggs), Love Point Winery, Patriot Acres Farm Brewery (goat milk soap) and each of the county's breweries.To complement the featured products, Chef Alicia Boyd of Humble Hearts Catering & Events curated and coordinated a lovely dinner for the attendees. Justin Crew of AP Speakeasy tended bar, serving beer, wine and spirits from area breweries, wineries, and distilleries.Michael Waskey Music performed, and Caroline Phillips photographed the event. All of the event vendors were also from Queen Anne's County.The event was originally set to take place at Godfrey's Farm in Sudlersville, but the air quality that day prompted a shift to an indoor venue.Kennard African American Cultural Heritage Center opened its doors to event goers and provided a beautiful, light-filled space to host the combined farmers market and dining experience for the evening. There were more than 60 people in attendance at the event, including representatives from Senator Ben Cardin's office, Senator Chris Van Hollen's Office, Delegate Steve Arentz, Commissioners Jim Moran and Jack Wilson, the Queen Anne's County Economic Development Commission, Upper Shore Regional Council, Chesapeake College, UMD Cooperative Extension, and Maryland Department of Commerce.\"What started out as a small idea with these micro ag grants became a collaboration between three counties and has turned out to be wildly successful. We even won an award at MACo for outstanding innovation,\" said Susan O'Neill, executive director of Upper Shore Regional Council.For more information on economic development in Queen Anne's County, Maryland, contact 410-604-2100 or email Heather Tinelli, htinelli@qac.org, or Rebecca Clark, rclark@qac.org. \n \n Caption: The event featured a dinner prepared by Chef Alicia Boyd of Humble Hearts Catering using products sourced from local farmers, growers and producers that were recipients of the micro grants.

Cookbooks and salt-glazed pottery also were sold.Retired middle school teacher Andy House of Bowie has been a volunteer since 2001, but has served as one of a handful of volunteer millers for about six years. He welcomed the low humidity that affects both the wooden structures and the grain.\"When everything works, it's a relaxing place to be,\" House said. \"It's working perfectly today.\" Local vendors set up tents and displays outdoors on the tree-shaded lawn, and volunteers sold homemade baked goods indoors. Local honey, grass-fed beef, wines and produce were on sale.Old Wye Mill is open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday to Saturday and 1 to 3 p.m. Sunday, May through October.

Members of the Bayshore Iris Society consist of professional growers and gardeners who appreciate the beauty and splendor of Iris blooms in our gardens.The cultivar names alone can be quite amusing and enticing.There are many types of irises from dwarf to tallbearded varieties that grow to various heights and sizes from underground root structures called rhizomes.While there are iris species that grow from bulbs, we promote rhizomatous iris.Members of the Bayshore Iris Society will have divided their iris from their personal gardens as well as three Iris Display Gardens at Preston Elementary School and Wye Mills in Preston and the Iris Display Garden on the grounds of the Wicomico County Memorial Park Garden on Route 13 in Salisbury.These iris come in a vast array of colors including whites, yellows, oranges, purples, to almost black bloom colors with many variations of color, shade, form, markings and beard colors and some with reblooming capability.There are thousands of different irises that are named and registered with the American Iris Society with about a thousand new introductions each year. Many new introductions include reblooming iris which have been hybridized to rebloom not just in April and May but rebloom periodically, some up to late fall and early winter, allowing Iris flowers to beautify your gardens for multiple seasons.Reblooming iris are considered the iris of the future by many iris enthusiasts.Our members will have harvested, cleaned, labeled and trimmed the iris rhizomes that can be purchased for fall planting for iris blooms next spring.Future activities of the Bayshore Iris Society include our fall reblooming STEM event at the Talbot County Public Library main meeting room on Thursday, Oct. 12. Here we will bring in cut flowering stalks of our reblooming flowering iris for the public display from 2-3 p.m. along with iris growing handouts and experienced growers to answer any questions you may have. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY TERRY HOLMAN\n \nThe gypsy lord iris. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "See lanternfly eggs? Scrape, smash, report\n\n September 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Cecelia Shilling; Capital News Service | Page: A4 | Section: News \n \n 657\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS, Md. - The spotted lanternfly, an invasive, crop-damaging insect, has finished mating season and is preparing to lay egg masses around Maryland, threatening farms and local plants, particularly on the Eastern Shore and in northern Maryland.If you see these egg masses or the bugs, officials say to scrape, smash and report eggs to the Department of Agriculture.Spotted lanternflies have spread quickly across 14 states, including Delaware, Virginia and Maryland since their arrival in the country from China in 2014, according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Though the flies don't sting or bite, they have threatened plants in Maryland since their discovery in 2018 in Cecil County.The bugs' preferred foods are fruit, like grapes, and trees, including maples, and especially the common, invasive, weedy tree of heaven.\"The spotted lanternfly causes serious damage, including oozing sap, wilting, leaf curling and dieback in trees, vines, crops and many other types of plants,\" said the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture's website. \"In addition to plant damage, when spotted lanternflies feed, they excrete a sugary substance, called honeydew, that encourages the growth of black, sooty mold.\" The pests can be identified by their distinctive gray, black and red wings with black spots, while the younger bugs in their \"nymph phase\" are black or red with white spots. These bugs can be found across the state, but infestations are worst in northern Maryland and along the Eastern Shore, according to the University of Maryland Extension.Though Sudlersville produce grower Jennie Schmidt finds the flies in her vineyard, she's found hundreds in her buffer area between farm acres, she said.\"When we were mowing one of our buffers a couple of weeks ago, my husband must have hit one of the tree of heaven and all these lanternflies came flying out. So we started looking more closely and in those groves of the tree of heaven, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of them,\" Schmidt said.Her main concern is transporting the lanternflies from her farm to other vineyards, she said.\"I don't want to travel with my grapes and my spotted lanternflies to places that don't already have them because I don't know how they got here, like, in the middle of nowhere,\" Schmidt continued.Owen Bailey, director of land use and policy for the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy, remembers seeing juvenile lanternflies in his Chestertown yard this spring.\"They were in my backyard along my fence line where I have a lot of wild grape vines growing, and I noticed dozens and dozens of them along that vine.I tried to squish them or kill them with my hands but they actually proved pretty fast and elusive,\" he said.The insects are most active during summer, but begin laying egg masses along any hard surfaces in September and ending in about November or until the first freeze, according to the Cornell College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.\"They (the egg masses) are about one inch long, and they have a gray mudlike covering. That covering will crack and dry over time,\" said Rachel Rhodes, University of Maryland Extension master gardener. \"So it kind of looks like a raised piece of putty. The covering will eventually flake off and it will reveal 30 to about 50 brown eggs.\" Lanternflies thrive here because they aren't preyed upon by the state's insects or animals, she continued.\"We do have praying mantis, and assassin bugs, and predatory stink bugs and birds. But because they are an invasive insect, we don't necessarily have natural predators in our areas that will go after them as a snack,\" Rhodes continued.Anyone can help curb the pest population: Officials recommend using a plastic card or putty knife to scrape then crush any lanternfly egg masses, as well as eliminating any trees of heaven to avoid attracting the insect. \n \n Caption: CREATIVE COMMONS\n \nA spotted lanternfly is caught in a spiderweb.

    "content": "Celebrating 100 years of Delmarva chicken\n\n September 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 20 | Section: News \n \n 1048\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Delmarva Chicken Festival returns on Oct. 7 to Salisbury at the Arthur W. Perdue Stadium beginning at 1 p.m. with no admission charged.This year celebrates the 100th year anniversary of the first dedicated broiler chicken farm on Delmarva. This year's festival will include food trucks, live music, vendors, historical and educational exhibits, and children's activities. The fireworks display will conclude the activities at about 7 p.m.The first chicken festival was held in 1948 and the last one was held in 2014.Due to the 100th anniversary of the Delmarva Poultry Industry it was decided to hold a final festival to mark this milestone. The Delmarva Poultry Industry continues to operate without festivals - the last one held in 2014.Now let's cook some old-fashioned pan-fried chicken.FRIED CHICKEN1½ cups milk, 2 large eggs, 2½ cups all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons salt, plus additional for sprinkling, 2 teaspoons black pepper, 4 pounds bone-in skin-on chicken pieces, vegetable oil for frying.Preheat the oven to 200 F and place a rack in a large baking pan. In a medium bowl, combine the milk and eggs. Whisk to blend well. In a large heavy-duty resealable plastic food storage bag, combine the flour, 2 tablespoons salt, and pepper. We used to use a wax lined hard paper bag.Seal and shake to combine.Dip the chicken pieces in the milk and egg mixture and let the excess drip off into the bowl. Set already dipped pieces aside on a plate until you have three or four. Add the dipped chicken pieces to the bag of seasoned flour. Seal the bag and shake well to coat the chicken pieces thoroughly.Remove to a plate and repeat with the remaining chicken pieces. Heat the oil in a deep, heavy skillet to 350 F. While it's heating up, set aside a large serving plate lined with paper towels. With a slotted spoon, move the done chicken pieces onto the paper towel-lined plate to drain. Sprinkle immediately with salt.Transfer the drained and seasoned chicken to the prepared pan with a rack. Keep warm in the preheated oven while frying subsequent batches. Depending on the size of your pan and number of guests on Sunday, this recipe will require about 3 to 4 batches.Leftover fried chicken can be reheated with good results. Take the chicken out of the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature.Heat the oven to 400 F. Put the chicken pieces on a rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet and bake for about 15 to 20 minutes until heated through and crisp.I gave you the mashed potato recipe earlier, but here is what makes that dish so special.COUNTRY CHICKEN POT PIE4 cups of diced cooked chicken, 2 cooked, cooled, diced potatoes, 3/4 cup diced celery, ½ cup onion, 2 Tablespoons butter, melted, 3 cups frozen mixed vegetables or 1 cup of fresh corn, 1 cup of fresh snapped green beans, 1 cup diced carrots,1 can cream of chicken soup,1 18 oz. value sized Heinz chicken gravy, 1 tsp salt, ½ tsp coarse black pepper, 1 tsp dried oregano, ½ tsp dried thyme, ¼ tsp dried ground sage, ½ tsp garlic salt, 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, 1 double pie crust, 1 egg, beaten, 2 tsp water. In a small skillet melt 2 Tablespoons butter. Add in 3/4 cup chopped celery and ½ cup diced onion. Sauté till translucent.In a large bowl add 4 cups chopped chicken, sauteed celery and onions, diced cold potatoes, 3 cups of frozen mixed vegetables, salt, pepper, thyme, oregano, sage, garlic salt and fresh parsley.Mix. Add in 1 can cream of chicken soup and the 18 oz. jar of chicken gravy. Mix till well blended.Roll bottom pie crust out.Place in a deep pie plate. Fill with meat and vegetable filling. Spread out evenly with a slightly mounded center. Roll out the top pie crust. Gently place it on top of the filling. Trim around the outside edge of the pie plate.Fold excess crust under. Flute crust edges with fingers. Cut small slits for vents in the top of the crust. Beat egg with water. Using a pastry brush, brush the top of the crust with egg wash. Place pot pie on top of foil lined baking sheet. Place in a preheated 325-degree oven and bake for 45-55 minutes.Pie is done when the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. (If the crust begins to brown too soon, cover it with a foil tent.) Allow to cool for 10 minutes.Slice and serve.CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS3 cups chicken (about 2-3 chicken breasts), 2 quarts chicken broth, 2 cups all-purpose flour, ½ teaspoon baking powder, 2 tablespoon cold salted butter, cubed, 1 cup milk, 2 tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper, to taste.Preheat the oven to 350 F degrees.Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Place chicken breast on the baking sheet and Drizzle a little olive oil on the chicken and season with salt and pepper.Bake chicken for about 45 minutes. Once the chicken is cooked, shred it with two forks. Pour 2 quarts of chicken stock or broth into a large pot and start warming it up on the stove top while you make the dumplings. In a medium bowl, combine flour and baking powder.Then add in cubed butter.Combine using your fingers, fork or pastry cutter. Pour in the milk. Mix it all together.Dust your counter with a generous amount of flour.Place dumpling dough on the counter and dust it with more flour. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out to about ¼-inch thickness. Be sure to add flour as necessary to keep it from sticking underneath or to your rolling pin. Using a knife or a pizza cutter, start cutting out your dumplings into squares. Dust dumplings with a bit more flour. The extra flour is all going to help keep them from sticking but will also thicken your chicken broth some as well when you add them to the pot.Bring chicken broth up to a boil. Add in shredded chicken and stir. Begin adding dumplings one at a time so they don't all stick together. Stir frequently while adding them. Allow dumplings to cook for about 15-20 minutes. You should notice your broth starting to thicken (from the extra flour) and your dumplings may start to sink a little to the bottom because they are soaking up the broth.Take one out and taste test it. It shouldn't have a doughy taste anymore. \n \n Caption: Fried chicken is an extremely popular food worldwide, but certainly on the Delmarva Peninsula. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Garden party - Galilee Garden in Chester continues to grow\n\n September 28, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A8 | Section: News \n \n 658\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTER - When Pearlie Mae Brown sold her home in southern Maryland and moved to Kent Island with her daughter, there was one thing that made her very unhappy-there was no place for her to garden. After all, she had been a gardener for most of her 85 years.Then she read about the Galilee Community Garden formed in 2015 to serve the need for a community garden in the Harbor View area of Chester. \"I was so happy to get right back at it again,\" she said.This past Saturday, the leaders of the Garden provided an update on the progress that has been made, the plans for the future, and a tour of the grounds.Lois Miller, who had been aware of community gardens through her work for a nonprofit, was a member of Galilee Lutheran Church.\"Members had been talking about this empty plot of land that the church owned,\" said Miller. \"We couldn't think of a better way to honor God's creation.\" A garden committee was formed involving volunteers from the church, local Master Gardeners, the Harbor View community, nearby Kent Island United Methodist Church, and the Boy Scout Troop 495. Since that time, the garden has grown to offer many beds of vegetables, flowers, and a separate herb garden with an irrigation system and compost area.Notably missing at the meeting was Master Gardener Larry Lorenz, who recently died from cancer.Lenz was instrumental in expanding the Garden, working tirelessly to grow and lead the garden efforts for years. \"We are so indebted to Larry who was such a blessing to work with,\" said Miller. \"This garden is his legacy.\" With the absence of Lorenz, Master Gardener Intern John McKnight will now take over as the representative for Galilee.Much of the infrastructure growth can be credited to the local Boy Scout Troop 495.Advisory Chair Elena Butler noted the Eagle Scout projects in support of the garden is very intensive, with the scout being in charge of raising money for the project, coordinating workers, and maintaining safety standards.Hadyn Blanchard's garden bridge project, completed in 2018, provided an access point for volunteers and church maintenance staff. Ricky Strucko built the first 10 garden beds; Sam Hopkins built two raised wheelchair-accessible garden beds in 2020; Nate Grimm built the underground irrigation system and CB Wilder built the compost area both in 2021. This year Harley Williams built a beautiful garden shed that will provide shelter and security for garden tools and equipment.Garden volunteer Steve Wyne mentioned numerous new projects in the works for spring of 2024, including installing more hose/spigot connections, investigating a new drip irrigation system, and initiating a new native pollination garden to attract more Monarch butterflies and bees.As one of three community gardens on Kent Island, Galilee Garden is the only one with room to expand. It is on church land, and the pastor and congregation strongly support the garden as part of their mission to support growing your own food and outreach to the community.The Rev. Dr. Belete Belay, pastor of the church, reflected on the importance of the garden's success.\"I have observed volunteers grow in unity and friendship,\" he said. \"My prayer is that you continue this project together in love.\" Brown said the gardening work has brought her great pride and joy. \"Every spring I ask God to bless my garden, not just for me but for everybody who is fed with it.\" Guests for the tour saw first-hand the growth taking place with 19 gardeners during the 2023 growing season. With handicap beds, compost bins, and land to expand, the club is always looking for new gardeners for this thriving community garden.For more information, go to https://www.facebook.com/GalileeCommunityGarden or email Jack McKnight at mcknightjohn143@gmail.com. \n \n Caption: Patricia Wyne discusses the natural habitat section of the Galilee Community Garden with Cheryl Hall.\n \nPHOTOS BY LAURA TAYMAN\n \nGardener Pearlie Mae Brown sits beside her garden bed at the Galilee Community Garden located in the Harbor View Community. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Halloween beetle sneaks inside to provide a scare as temps drop\n\n October 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Cecelia Shilling; Capital News Service | Page: 14 | Section: News \n \n 647\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS, Md. - A spooky, imported ladybug, often mistaken for a native bug, known as the Halloween beetle is preparing to migrate from gardens and into homes as Maryland heads for colder weather.And while they are extremely valuable to plant life, the little bugs bite. Halloween beetle home infestations could result in odors and stains, too.W hen these pumpkin-colored beetles aren't invading homes, they are outdoors helping control the aphid population by eating as many as 1,000 of the pests during their development, said University of Maryland entomology professor and extension specialist Michael Raupp.Aphids, often called plant lice, damage host plants by sucking juices from leaves and promoting discoloration, leaf curling and stunted growth in crops like squash, cucumbers, melons, beans and potatoes, said the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources pest management program.\"These (Halloween beetles) are enormously beneficial,\" Raupp said. \"They were actually imported at least a couple of times in the United States to help reduce pest populations on important agricultural crops. In the South, they were very important in helping to reduce pests in pecan crops.\" Also called the Asian ladybug, lady beetle or multicolored ladybird beetle, the bug was imported from Asia and released in 1916 to control pests. The first established population in the U.S. was found in New Orleans in 1988.Since their initial release, entomologists transported the insect across the country a number of times, said the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Unlike the native American common convergent ladybug, the Halloween lady beetle can be identified by an \"M\" shaped marking behind its head and can be red, yellow or orange with black spots, Raupp said.\"Adults (mature Halloween beetles) often cluster together in October and November to overwinter in sheltered locations. When a few adults find a suitable spot, they release a chemical that attracts other multicolored Asian lady beetles to the same location,\" said a Clemson Extension Home and Garden Center fact sheet. They then move together indoors.Though the insects are good for gardens and plant life, they may become a nuisance when indoors.When threatened, the insect employs a reaction called \"reflex bleeding\" that releases bitter smelling and tasting chemicals from their joints that are a \"nasty witch's brew of many different compounds that evolved to deter predators,\" Raupp said.\"If you pick these things up they'll leave kind of funny yellow or orange stain on your finger. If you smash them against the drape, they're going to discolor that drape,\" he said. \"There are also reports of these little guys giving you a little nip.\" A Halloween beetle bite can leave some people with small, painful bumps on their skin, but their bites aren't something to worry about. They don't sting or carry disease, according to the Michigan State University Center for Integrated Plant Systems.That's not how University of Maryland student Zainab Balhis remembers a Halloween beetle infestation in October of 2021 in her College Park dorm room.\"When I was living in Centreville (a UMD dorm) during my freshman year, eight in the span of a week flew into my room,\" Balhis said. \"They were getting in through the cracks in my window because I was living in an older dorm.\" Balhis also remembers one \"pretty gnarly bite,\" she saw on her skin while the bugs were in her room.The best way to keep Halloween beetles out of your home is to seal all openings and cracks, said Raupp.\"The best way to manage Asian ladybugs is to prevent them from getting inside the home in the first place,\" according to the University of New Hampshire Extension service.\"Remove air conditioners when they are no longer needed and take care to seal up cracks around windows and doors, particularly on the sunny southern and western sides of the house.\" \n \n Caption: MICHAEL RA UPP/BUGOFTHEWEEK.COM\n \nThe Halloween beetle rests on a leaf.

But this is a first - a horrible weed infestation called Creeping Charlie has taken over the lawn.I have tried weed killers, but nothing I've tried has worked to kill the entire weed down to the roots. I look at my neighbor's lawn and see it growing there, too. Do you have a recommendation that would take care of Creeping Charlie without killing the grass?Thanks. - Beth Dear Beth: Oh, my, I am laughing quietly as I read your letter. When I was a newlywed, my neighbor and I actually shared Creeping Charlie cuttings and grew them in pots to adorn our apartments. We thought we were prolific \"gardeners\" because our plants grew, well like weeds!Hand-pulling Creeping Charlie, making sure to get every smidgen of that rhizome (root) is one way to stop a very early invasion. And there is a lot of room for error there, which means using this as a punishment for misbehaved kids might not be such a great idea.The only herbicide I can confidently recommend to win this war is T-Zone Turf Herbicide (1.2 ounces per gallon of water). You can find this on Amazon, perhaps at your local home improvement center, or local garden store. T-Zone Turf Herbicide is a broadleaf herbicide, which means that when applied carefully and according to label instructions and warnings, it will kill Mr. Creepy but leave your lawn intact.You will need a good sprayer that matches the size of your project. A backpack-type power sprayer would likely be a good investment for you and your neighbor to share.I wish you well with waging war against this creepy lawn invader.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\"COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Fall is for digging up sweet potatoes\n\n October 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mabel Savage | Page: A4 | Section: News \n \n 1514\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Sweet potatoes are a classic fall favorite that requires a lot of work if you grow your own.We did back in the day on the farm. Each year there would be certain foods that were harvested for the coming winter months - white potatoes, turnips, corn and sweet potatoes.It took most of the family to help harvest these crops.A couple of days in advance, the baskets were prepared for digging day.The older brothers set aside the day to help my dad and the younger brothers.We cleaned and made space in the storage shed to place the sweet potatoes.They were sorted in baskets according to size. Usually digging day was on Saturday, when everyone was off work and out of school.A few days later, mom would wash some of the larger ones and cook them in large pots of boiling water until tender, then drain off water and cool enough to remove the skins and snip off ends.They were then placed in freezer bags and frozen for later use.Not only do sweet potatoes taste great they provide many health benefits.When eating sweet potatoes do not remove the skins, as they contain antioxidants including vitamin A and beta-carotene. They also have sporamin.Eating sweet potatoes is great to help manage your blood sugar levels, improve your immune system strength, improve your vision and help eliminate bacteria in the intestines.Let's get exploring some great sweet potato recipes.SWEET POTATO BISCUITS1 cup sweet potato cooked, mashed, and cooled,¼ cup granulated sugar, 1 large egg beaten, 1 tbsp butter melted, 1 cup milk, 3 cups self-rising flour, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon nutmeg,½ cup shortening.Start by combining sweet potato, sugar, egg and melted butter. Beat with a fork until smooth then stir in milk. Set mixture aside.Stir together self-rising flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large mixing bowl. Cut in shortening until it resembles coarse crumbs.Make a well in the center of the dry mixture. Add spiced sweet-potato mixture and stir just until combined. Turn out the biscuit mixture onto a well-floured surface. Knead gently for 10 to 12 strokes.Don't overdo it. Pat dough to about 1/2-inch thickness.Cut with a floured 2-1/2-inch biscuit cutter. Place biscuits 1 inch apart on a large baking sheet. Bake in a 400 degree F oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until the biscuits are lightly browned.SWEET POTATO FLUFF3 cups sweet potatoes cooked and mashed, 2 tablespoons butter, 1/4 cup orange juice, or milk, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/3 cup marshmallow creme, or fluff, 1 large well beaten egg, 1 cup miniature marshmallows. Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 F. Combine sweet potatoes, butter, orange juice or milk, salt, and 1/3 cup of marshmallow creme. Beat in egg. Pile sweet potatoes in a lightly buttered baking dish.Bake for 25 minutes. Top with miniature marshmallows and brown under broiler for about 4 minutes.CANDIED SWEET POTATOES4 to 5 large sweet potatoes, about 8 to 10 cups peeled and cubed, 2 tablespoons orange zest, from 1 orange, 1/4 cup orange juice, from 1 orange, 1 cup light brown sugar, packed, 1/4 cup honey, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, nutmeg. Gather the ingredients. Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes. Lightly grease the slow cooker crock.Arrange the sweet potato cubes in the slow cooker.Use a zester or grater to get the zest from 1 orange, then squeeze the orange to get its juice. In a small bowl, combine the orange zest, orange juice, brown sugar, honey, butter, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Heat the mixture in the microwave or on the stovetop in a saucepan.Stir to blend and pour the mixture over the sweet potato cubes. Cover and cook on LOW for 6 to 8 hours, until the sweet potatoes are tender.OLD FASHIONED BAKED SWEET POTATOES4 medium sweet potatoes, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 tablespoons butter, Kosher salt, Freshly ground black pepper, cinnamon sugar. Preheat the oven to 425 F. Line a baking pan with foil. Scrub sweet potatoes thoroughly, dry, and prick each one in several places with a fork to aerate. Rub oil all over each potato. Arrange potatoes on foil and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until they are fork tender. Cut a 1 1/2-inch \"X\" in the center of each baked sweet potato. Using a clean dish rag or potholder to protect your hands, hold a potato on each side and press upward until filling \"bursts\" up through cuts.Top with butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Season with paprika or a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. Wash and dry your sweet potatoes thoroughly. This will help the skin to crisp up well during baking.CROCK POT CARAMEL GLAZED SWEET POTATOES2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for buttering slow cooker4 to 6 medium sweet potatoes, about 2 1/2 to 3 pounds, peeled and sliced, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 cup brown sugar, packed, 3 tablespoons cornstarch, 1 teaspoon cinnamon.Lightly butter the inner sides and bottom of the slow cooker. Add sliced sweet potatoes and sprinkle with salt. Combine sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over the sweet potatoes. Cut butter into small ¼ cubes and drop into the crock pot. Cover and cook on low for 7 to 9 hours.Here is a non-traditional recipe that my son John makes with sweet potatoes.ITALIAN SWEET POTATOES4 medium sweet potatoes, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 3/4 pound hot Italian sausage, 1 cup chopped red bell pepper, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 2 clove garlic minced, 1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 cup Italian cheese blend, Italian parsley, chopped. Preheat the oven to 425 F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Scrub the sweet potatoes thoroughly, dry, and prick each one in several places with a fork to allow the steam to escape. Rub olive oil all over each potato. Arrange the potatoes on the foillined baking sheet and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until they are fork-tender. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Crumble the sausage into the skillet and cook until the sausage begins to brown. Add the red pepper, onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, and salt to the skillet.Stir and cook until the vegetables are soft. Place the Italian sausage and vegetable mixture in a large bowl.Cut each baked sweet potato in half and scoop out most of the inside, leaving the potato skin shell fully intact. Add the scooped sweet potato to the bowl with the Italian sausage and vegetables. Stir to combine. Spoon the sweet potato and sausage mixture back into baked potato skins.Top with cheese and return to the oven for 5 minutes or until the cheese is browned on top and potato skins start to crisp. Top with parsley and serve.SWEET POTATO PIE2 cups Cooked Mashed Sweet Potatoes, 1.25 cups Granulated Sugar, 1/4 cup Butter, melted, 2 Eggs, 1 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract, 1/4 tsp Salt, 1/4 tsp Ground Cinnamon, 1/4 tsp Ground Ginger, 1 cup Evaporated Milk, 9\" Frozen Pie Shell.Preheat the oven to 350°F.In a mixing bowl combine the sweet potatoes, sugar, melted butter, eggs, vanilla, salt, cinnamon and ginger.Mix together with a hand mixer until well combined.Add the evaporated milk and mix to combine. Add the pie filling mixture to the pie crust and place into the oven.Bake for 45 minutes or until done. Center of the pie should be set when done. Allow to cool before serving. Top with whipped cream, if desired.OVEN BAKED SWEET POTATO FRIES2 pounds orange fleshed sweet potatoes (about 3 large) 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1 to 2 tablespoons spice or spice combination of your choice: chipotle powder, pumpkin pie spice. For more crispiness, preheat your oven to 500°F.Place a roasting pan or heavy duty baking sheet (one that can take high heat) in the oven to preheat.Peel the sweet potatoes and cut off the ends. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise and then, if they are very long, in half crosswise. Cut each piece into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick wedges. Alternatively, you can slice the peeled sweet potato into disks either with a mandoline or a sharp knife. Put the sweet potatoes into a large bowl and add the oil. Mix well to combine.Sprinkle them with salt and spices of your choice.Use your hands to mix well, so all pieces are coated with oil and spices. Remove the preheated baking sheet from the oven. Carefully spread the sweet potatoes out in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 25 minutes. After the first 10 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven and use tongs to turn over all of the sweet potato pieces. Return to the oven and bake for another 5 to 15 minutes, or until they are well browned.Cooking time depends on the temperature of the oven (500°F will need less cooking time than 450°F) and the size and thinness of the sweet potato wedges. The browner they are, the crispier they will be, but there is a fine line between browned and burnt beyond edibility.Even if they get really dark, they should still be good because of the natural sugars of the sweet potatoes caramelizing. \n \n Caption: METR O CREAT IVE SERVICES\n \nMabel Savage's oven baked sweet potato fries can be spiced a variety of different ways. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Farms balance agritourism with need to preserve land\n\n October 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Kiersten Hacker; Capital News Service | Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 872\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS - Welcoming about 40,000 visitors to over 1,200 acres during the whirlwind fall season, there is no shortage of preparation for Baugher's Orchard and Farm Market to build fun and protect the farmland from damage at the same time.\"There is a lot of maintenance involved with inviting the public on your property, but it is a good business for us, and we feel that in general, society gets to see the work involved with farming and how our food gets produced, which is beneficial for everyone,\" Dottie Dunn, an administrator for the Westminster company, wrote in an email to Capital News Service.The fall agritourism season is quick, but it is the most profitable, Dunn said. Winter and spring consist of prepping for that season - planting and pruning trees to fixing crates, fences and other equipment.Maryland is home to over 1 million acres of farmland that is uniquely \"sliced by major highways and metropolitan areas,\" said Maryland Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Atticks. Farms that are close to densely populated cities such as Baltimore, Annapolis, or Washington, D.C., can draw people in, boosting economic opportunities for farmers.\"Our goal and our interest here in Maryland is to make it so that to be a farmer means that you can have a great career and be profitable to put kids through school, retire,\" Atticks said. \"And agritourism plays a huge role in that because Maryland, unlike some other states that are not as densely populated, we have a ready market of consumers who are interested not just in products, but they're interested in experiences.\" Buying produce directly from local farms generates more revenue for farmers while also cutting costs if visitors are paying to pick their produce. Also lucrative is \"value-added\" agriculture - turning raw farm products into finished foods.According to a 2020 Grow & Fortify report, value-added agriculture employs about 74,000 people and generates $20.6 billion with $875 million going to the state's fiscal resources. Grow & Fortify is a group that helps support and grow value-added agriculture businesses and organizations in Maryland.\"People have a piqued interest to get onto farms, and so when farms allow or have the ability for people to experience that, and they're able to charge for it, it creates another revenue source for farmers which is important for sometimes a next generation being able to be added to the farm,\" said Parker Welch, executive director of the Maryland Farm Bureau.Farmers need to make intentional decisions about their location, what they will grow and sell, what permits are needed and other factors before opening their farm to the public, Atticks said.Because each parcel is different, there may be varying regulations and permitting processes depending on the county it is located in or if it is preserved farmland.Planning for parking lots, portable toilets, farmstand or farm market infrastructure, restaurants or septic systems can pose challenges. So do concerns about stormwater management and water capture from parking lots, according to Atticks. But selling directly to consumers will spike revenues, Atticks said, and ultimately farmers are \"building an experience rather than just selling a product.\" For Maryland Corn Maze owner Carol Paul, the permitting process and yearly inspections for the fall festival activities have become routine. She has run the Gambrills corn maze since 2014, taking over from family farmer Marian Fry, who initially established the maze to raise startup money to buy crops.The process for growing and maintaining the corn maze begins in March with the decision of the year's theme. Then the map is drawn out, the corn is planted, the pathways are cut when the corn is 2 inches tall and the shape is kept through mowing. This year Paul is dealing with Johnsongrass, which must be controlled under a Maryland law prohibiting harmful weeds.\"You always want to make sure that it's still being kept as farmland, that you're not ruining it for crop planting later,\" Paul said.The land for the corn maze isn't used for other farming, so after the season, Paul said another crop must be planted to \"trick the land.\" Otherwise, the corn won't grow well.Baugher's Orchard rotates where crops are planted each year as part of its land maintenance.Other measures include changing the walkways and planting orchard grass to prevent erosion.Despite the many trash cans on the farm, Dunn said trash still ends up on the ground and it must be cleaned up after every weekend.Baugher's tries to reduce its produce waste by selling extra apples and pumpkins at the market and working to create more merchandise such as apple pies, apple butter, apple sauce and apple cider with damaged produce.Dunn said educating visitors on the proper method of picking the produce can also help to reduce food waste.\"Without customers, there is no reason for all the work, it needs to be a good balance of workability,\" Dunn said.But all the work needed for a few months of fun is worth it when families can come together, reconnecting with each other and the local farms growing their food.\"It was like these people are coming here and time is kind of standing still,\" Paul said, \"Like these families are spending time together out on the farm And it's the coolest thing to watch.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Winter and spring consist of prepping for that season - planting and pruning trees to fixing crates, fences and other equipment.Maryland is home to over 1 million acres of farmland that is uniquely \"sliced by major highways and metropolitan areas,\" said Maryland Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Atticks. Farms that are close to densely populated cities such as Baltimore, Annapolis, or Washington, D.C., can draw people in, boosting economic opportunities for farmers.\"Our goal and our interest here in Maryland is to make it so that to be a farmer means that you can have a great career and be profitable to put kids through school, retire,\" Atticks said. \"And agritourism plays a huge role in that because Maryland, unlike some other states that are not as densely populated, we have a ready market of consumers who are interested not just in products, but they're interested in experiences.\" Buying produce directly from local farms generates more revenue for farmers while also cutting costs if visitors are paying to pick their produce. Also lucrative is \"value-added\" agriculture - turning raw farm products into finished foods.According to a 2020 Grow & Fortify report, value-added agriculture employs about 74,000 people and generates $20.6 billion with $875 million going to the state's fiscal resources. Grow & Fortify is a group that helps support and grow value-added agriculture businesses and organizations in Maryland.\"People have a piqued interest to get onto farms, and so when farms allow or have the ability for people to experience that, and they're able to charge for it, it creates another revenue source for farmers which is important for sometimes a next generation being able to be added to the farm,\" said Parker Welch, executive director of the Maryland Farm Bureau.Farmers need to make intentional decisions about their location, what they will grow and sell, what permits are needed and other factors before opening their farm to the public, Atticks said. Because each parcel is different, there may be varying regulations and permitting processes depending on the county it is located in or if it is preserved farmland.Planning for parking lots, portable toilets, farmstand or farm market infrastructure, restaurants or septic systems can pose challenges. So do concerns about stormwater management and water capture from parking lots, according to Atticks. But selling directly to consumers will spike revenues, Atticks said, and ultimately farmers are \"building an experience rather than just selling a product.\" For Maryland Corn Maze owner Carol Paul, the permitting process and yearly inspections for the fall festival activities have become routine. She has run the Gambrills corn maze since 2014, taking over from family farmer Marian Fry, who initially established the maze to raise startup money to buy crops.The process for growing and maintaining the corn maze begins in March with the decision of the year's theme. Then the map is drawn out, the corn is planted, the pathways are cut when the corn is 2 inches tall and the shape is kept through mowing. This year Paul is dealing with Johnsongrass, which must be controlled under a Maryland law prohibiting harmful weeds.\"You always want to make sure that it's still being kept as farmland, that you're not ruining it for crop planting later,\" Paul said.The land for the corn maze isn't used for other farming, so after the season, Paul said another crop must be planted to \"trick the land.\" Otherwise, the corn won't grow well.Baugher's Orchard rotates where crops are planted each year as part of its land maintenance.Other measures include changing the walkways and planting orchard grass to prevent erosion.Despite the many trash cans on the farm, Dunn said trash still ends up on the ground and it must be cleaned up after every weekend.Baugher's tries to reduce its produce waste by selling extra apples and pumpkins at the market and working to create more merchandise such as apple pies, apple butter, apple sauce and apple cider with damaged produce.Dunn said educating visitors on the proper method of picking the produce can also help to reduce food waste.\"Without customers, there is no reason for all the work, it needs to be a good balance of workability,\" Dunn said.But all the work needed for a few months of fun is worth it when families can come together, reconnecting with each other and the local farms growing their food.\"It was like these people are coming here and time is kind of standing still,\" Paul said, \"Like these families are spending time together out on the farm And it's the coolest thing to watch.\" \n \n Caption: FILE PHOTO\n \nPictured in this file photo are the black Angus cows at Still Waters Angus Farm in Rising Sun. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But here's the problem: At my house, we frequently cannot consume them in the short window of a couple of days before they turn mushy and slightly spoiled.I have tested so many ways to keep tomatoes fresh long enough to use them - on the counter, upside down, in a closed container in the fridge, attached to the stem, to name a few.None were super satisfying.Another method that promised to give excellent results was to store a fresh tomato on the counter but turn it upside down so that it is resting on the stem area. At first, this seemed foolish to me, but I gave it a trial run anyway. Surprisingly, it did seem to help to extend freshness for a day or two, which at the time was exciting as it was better than other methods I tested. The idea is to shield the tomato's \"opening\" spot from heat and light.But this new method? It is now my absolute favorite and the only way I will ever store tomatoes.The theory is that cellophane tape applied securely to the tomato to cover the spot where the stem was attached to the vine, creates a barrier to hold moisture in and keep potential bacteria and mold out.Using this method, I can leave an unwashed, \"taped\" tomato on the counter for 10 days, and find it is as fresh as it was on day 1. I simply remove the tape, wash the tomato, slice and enjoy. That's it - the best way ever to store fresh tomatoes long enough to actually use them, without any detectable change in texture or flavor.

Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system.Confirmation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory is pending, with final results anticipated in the coming days.\"High Pathogenic Avian influenza or HPAI does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain healthy and safe to eat and handle. Poultry growers, operators, and backyard flock owners should be on high alert of the threat of HPAI,\" said Maryland Department of Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks.\"The Maryland Department of Agriculture, local health department, USDA and partner organizations are working diligently to address the situation, including quarantining and testing nearby flocks.\" Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.If HPAI is suspected on personal property, wild birds, or in a commercial operation, the Maryland Department of Agriculture recommends following common-sense biosecurity steps, including looking for signs of illness and knowing warning signs of infectious bird diseases.To report a possible case of HPAI, call the Maryland Department of Agriculture at 410-841-5810.Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov.Other key biosecurity practices include cleaning and disinfecting transportation, removing loose feed, keeping visitors to a minimum, washing hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry, providing disposable boot covers or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with a flock, changing clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property, cleaning and disinfecting tools and equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Three of the awardees are based on the Eastern Shore.The Maryland Grain Producers Utilization Board, headquartered in Queenstown, won the Volunteers of the Year award.Also awarded at the event were Agriculture Advocate of the Year Amy Cawley of Denton, who oversees Maryland Food Bank's Farm to Food Program; Philanthropist of the Year Jim Perdue of Purdue Farms based in Salisbury; and Nonprofit of the Year Wild Kid Acres in Edgewater.Maryland Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Atticks attended the event.\"Farming on the mind of an esteemed organization like this is a testament to just how important it is,\" he said.\"Agriculture and farming is the number one industry in Maryland.\" The Maryland Grain Producers Utilization Board administers the Maryland Grain Checkoff Program.Grain producers in Maryland voted to institute this voluntary checkoff program, which is funded by participating growers donating 0.5% of each Maryland bushel sold.\"The Maryland Grain Checkoff is refundable, and yet MGPUB has an average annual refund percentage of just 3.4%, demonstrating that Maryland farmers see the value in donating their hard-earned money to this important cause,\" Maryland Grain Producers Association Executive Director Lindsay Thompson stated in a press release.Notable education projects include providing primary funding for Maryland Public Television's Maryland Farm & Harvest, which has educated over 11 million viewers about Maryland agriculture. MGPUB also funds many youth agriculture education programs through Maryland Extension and FFA throughout the state.Amy Cawley, who oversees Maryland Food Bank's Farm to Food Bank Program, received the Agricultural Advocate award. Cawley, who grew up on a farm in Denton, said she knew for a long time that lots of fresh food was going to waste.Cawley grew the program from two participating farms in 2011 to 60 farms today.\"This is hundreds of thousands of pounds of food that people who were food-insecure wouldn't have received,\" she said. In 2023, Maryland farmers raised 1 million pounds of food in one single season through the program.A familiar name and face was honored this year as Philanthropist of the Year, Jim Perdue of Perdue Farms, headquartered in Salisbury.\"It's rare for a business to become bigger with each generation, but that's been the case with Perdue,\" Atticks said. \"Though the business is food-based, it's also a people business.\" During the first week of November, the Purdue and McCormick companies delivered nutritious meals to 5,200 families on the Eastern Shore, and in fiscal year 2023, his foundation provided nearly $1.7 million to 71 nonprofits.This year's Nonprofit of the Year award went to Wild Kid Acres owned by Gerardo Martinez.A Naval Academy graduate and U.S. Marine, he dreamed of owning a farm while visiting El Salvador.He found just the spot, a 5-acre farm in Edgewater, where he took on the construction of the home and farm himself using \"climate-smart agricultural practices.\" Martinez received requests to visit the farm and engage with the assortment of rescued animals who roam together freely on the property.In 2020, the family opened the farm for community agricultural enrichment.By 2021 Wild Kid Acres was thriving as a location for animal therapy clients, a summer enrichment camp and goat yoga.Martinez said he is also pleased to see minority communities come visit, sometimes seeing farms and animals for the first time.Audrey Scott, former chair and current member of the Chesapeake Charities board, suggested years ago holding the annual honor awards ceremony as a fundraiser. \"I had been on another board, and they made a lot of money with these award dinners,\" she said. \"Well, we're in the nonprofit business, so I said let's do our own.\" Chesapeake Charities is a community foundation, a tax-exempt public charity, for philanthropists to establish charitable funds or donate to a cause they support.With over 160 funds, the foundation works on charitable projects in nine counties: Anne Arundel, Calvert, Caroline, Charles, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's, St. Mary's and Talbot. \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nJessica, Zaria and Gerardo Martinez accept the Nonprofit of the Year Award from Chesapeake Charities for Wild Kid Acres in Edgewater. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The program \"combines field gleanings, donations, and contract growing to form the cornerstone of the food bank's nutrition strategy,\" according to MFB's website.\"It's surreal to me to receive such a recognition - Agriculture Advocate of the Year just blows my mind,\" she said. \"I said I was born an advocate because of Pop Pop and Dad and being in a farming family.\" The focus of this year's awards was agriculture.Three of this year's awardees are based on the Eastern Shore.The Maryland Grain Producers Utilization Board, headquartered in Queenstown, won the Volunteers of the Year award. MGPUB is a group of farmers helping farmers who have funded more than $26 million in grants to improve the profitability and sustainability of state agriculture and farm families. Philanthropist of the Year is Jim Perdue of Purdue Farms based in Salisbury.Nonprofit of the Year is Wild Kid Acres in Edgewater.Maryland Grain Producers Association Executive Director Lindsay Thompson nominated Cawley for the award.\"There's so many people that advocate for agriculture,\" Cawley said. \"So, for Lindsay to nominate me and for it to be approved, I can't even put it into words.\" Cawley, who grew up on a farm in Denton, said she knew for a long time that lots of fresh food was going to waste.Calling her a \"superhero,\" MFB states on its website that Cawley \"has helped the program grow from its humble roots with just two partners - First Fruits Farms in northern Baltimore County and Arnold Farms in northeastern Queen Anne's County - into a powerhouse produce program with more than 60 farms that infuse our statewide food distribution efforts with hundreds of thousands of pounds of nutritious fruits and vegetables annually.\" Cawley said the program next year will be venturing into dairy and trying new kinds of vegetables and fruits to be mindful of foods other cultures eat.\"We get everything from apples to zucchini and everything in between, and now we're doing culturally inclusive crops that I had never heard of before,\" Cawley said. She said she's learning about Caribbean produce like callaloo, scotch bonnet peppers and Jamaican pumpkin. MFB is \"trying to do a better job of\" serving \"all kinds of ethnicities and cultures.\" She recently earned her CDL license, enabling her to drive a tractor-trailer. A couple of weeks ago, Cawley \"drove from Salisbury to Baltimore with 22 pallets of potatoes. Everything else was okay, but the (Chesapeake) Bay Bridge was very, very intimidating,\" she said.\"I've had upwards of 70 farms a year,\" Cawley said.\"My best year was 2014 as far as donations. We got 2 million pounds of produce donated from farmers off the Eastern Shore. Anywhere I can get produce in Maryland, I cover. I'm a onewoman show.\" \"I'm always advocating for the farmers for the Maryland food bank because only 2% of the population farm, so none of my co-workers really understand agriculture,\" Cawley said. \"I'm always educating them on produce and how Mother Nature influences that and how the contracts I set up may not come to fruition, or they may go over and above what we said because it was such a good year. I teach them on the seasonality, how it's packaged, how long it lasts.\" Not only does she advocate for farmers, Cawley said, \"We're advocating for those who are food insecure all across Maryland, and that the need is out there, and how it can be anybody that's food insecure. It can be loss of a job, illness, accidents, anything. Most of us are one paycheck away from struggle, and we don't realize that until it happens.\" The farmers she works with are larger scale operations, backyard gardeners and even the Caroline-Dorchester County Fair, whose organizers donate \"maybe 75 pounds of produce a year,\" she said.\"So (donations) can be 100 pounds to thousands of pounds. Every pound makes a difference.\" Cawley was accompanied to the awards luncheon by her mom Jane Cawley, who \"was beaming from ear to ear,\" according to Charles Cawley, Amy's dad. Her pastor, the Rev. Mary Friel of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Centreville, attended and offered a prayer at the luncheon.Friel received her invitation and called Cawley to congratulate her. \"I asked her, 'What are you talking about?' I think they had told me a month before, but I forgot all about it,\" Cawley said.\"I thanked everybody that helped me get to where I am at the Maryland Food Bank,\" Cawley said in a Nov.25 interview. \"I thanked my mom and dad. I thanked my Pop Pop. I thanked my friend Linda, who owns Clayton Farms (who) taught me everything I know about produce. I thanked LEAD Maryland. I thanked Hannah, my sister-in-law, because she went through LEAD Maryland. I thanked Butch who hired me, and I thanked the Food Bank for keeping me around.\" The LEAD Maryland Foundation manages and allocates funds directly to the education and training of emerging leaders serving agriculture, natural resources and rural communities.Laura Tayman contributed to this story. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF MARY LAND FOOD BANK\n \nAmy Cawley poses with a bunch of collard greens donated to the Maryland Food Bank.\n \nCOURTESY OF CHESAPEAKE CHARITIES\n \nMaryland Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Atticks congratulates Amy Cawley, director of the Maryland Food Bank's Farm to Food Bank program, who received this year's Chesapeake Charities Agriculture Advocate of the Year Award. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Evergreen Fresh - Cawley Tree Farm offers variety of fresh trees, greens\n\n November 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 15 | Section: News \n \n 773\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - They've been farming west of Denton more than 100 years, and for over a quarter of that century, Cawley Family Farm has branched out to become the only Christmas tree farm in Caroline County.On the Saturday after Thanksgiving, a steady stream of families rolled up the lane of the farm, past the festively decorated John Deere combine, past the Cawley family home and past a huge pavilion housing cut evergreen trees from North Carolina.\"It's a beautiful day,\" said owner Charles Cawley.\" It's going good. We've got good trees. I got some beautiful trees - a little pricier than last year but still beautiful trees - got a lot on the lot, as you can see. The Canaans are going out of here like crazy.\" In addition to Canaan firs, Cawley grows Concolor and Douglas firs, blue spruce and white pine - all on about 15 acres of the farm.\"We can't grow Frasers, so we bring them in,\" Cawley said.\"But we're the only one that brings in a tree, recuts it and puts it in holding tanks. No one else does that. So we sell the freshest pre-cut trees you can buy.\" \"They're very hard to get, but we've got some beautiful Frasers,\" he said.Cawley said it took him a while, but he \"got to how to grow\" Canaan firs about 15 years ago.He pampers them, irrigating, spoon-feeding and growing them in \"real thick grass. It helps keep the roots cooler because it gets too hot here,\" he said.According to the National Christmas Tree Association, the Canaan fir is a \"relative newcomer to the Christmas tree market, with many similarities to both Fraser and balsam firs.\" About 500 to 600 trees are brought in from North Carolina.\"We sold about 200 off the lot, so we're selling between 700 and 800 a year,\" Cawley said.Keeping the trees fresh is important to Cawley. \"When we sell one of these (Frasers) they'll hold the needles as long as one of those out in the field,\" he said. \"And these things drink a lot of water initially. I mean, we just got these the day before Thanksgiving, and I had to fill these tanks up a couple times, they soaked up that much water.\" Once the trees are rehydrated, they are shaken, drilled with a tapered bit, set up on a pin stand in a shallow steel basin and kept watered. The operation has two drilling machines, three shakers and plenty of water holding bins inside and outdoors.The 55-foot by 80-foot pavilion can be closed off when the wind whips up to keep the trees from dehydrating. \"If we had to add a little heat, we can, but we haven't had to,\" he said.Cawley clearly takes pride in his product, and his family pitches in. Arriving at 7 a.m. was his 7-year-old grandson Bryant, ready to get started - and put in a 12-hour day.Cawley's eldest daughter, Amy, makes wreaths and wood-burned ornaments from slices of sawed off stumps. The focus is on customer service, so other family members, as well as employees, wait on customers, shake needles from trees, wrap net around them and tote them to cars.Cawley is vice president of the Maryland Christmas Tree Association. He said he started out as a farmer, \"but I did a lot of things in the meantime,\" even working for \"all three levels of government - county, state and federal. You don't build this by just farming. It takes something else,\" Cawley said, adding that his wife Jane is a retired school nurse.Several years of drought, along with root aphids in the Douglass firs and scale on some Canaans, have affected the growth and aesthetics of a few trees in the field, so Cawley has to be vigilant.\"There's a challenge every year,\" he said.Cawley Family Farm Christmas tree sales began Nov. 21.You can visit 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and on Monday to Thursday by appointment. The farm is located at 24320 Willow Pond Road, Denton. For more information, call 410-479-4780 or 410-829-4781, or email info@cawley.farm.

    "content": "Fresh pork on the farm\n\n November 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Marie Savage; Country Cooking | Page: 20 | Section: News \n \n 1557\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Each year, my parents held two old-fashioned hog kills to fill the smokehouse and freezers with meat. once in November and once in March.This supply of meat fit perfectly with the previous summers canned vegetables, jellies, relishes, applesauce and much more. Did I mention the shed with potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions and turnips?It was not a lot of hard work because we all pitched in, and my dad had several farm hands helping.Everybody left at the end of the day with full stomachs and a package of sausage, scrapple or seasoning meat.Today, as I ride past the old farm place, I get upset looking thinking of those days gone by. I can still see the late Mr. Jim Showell ready to hang the meat and the late Mr. Ed Sturgis ready to hang the iron pots over the fire he would make.Mom would allow her children and grandchildren to ghelp h with the work, but she had a hand in all of it. especially the final taste testing of the sausage and scrapple.The morning of the slaughter found my sister and I scrubbing down the cutting surfaces, the mixing utensils, the pans to hold scrapple and the trays for both loose sausage and link sausage.In the smokehouse waited the exceptionally clean sharp meat hooks to hang the hams and shoulders. Finally, there were the cans to hold the fresh pressed lard. what a beautiful sight so pure clear white.The one job that my mother had every year was sausage maker.Either one of my brothers or nephews would feed the cut-up pork parts into the top of the grinder. My mother sat stretching sheep fs intestines for the casing over the tube and working the ground sausage as it fed into the intestines and into a large bowl.This was a job that I later inherited, and since it was the only job where you could actually sit at our hog killings, I didn ft mind.There are many funny stories associated with hog killing adventures throughout the years, but time will not allow today.In the next few winter months, I will slip them in. The one I love the most was when the could hogs have gotten me in big trouble, but my bus driver, the late Mr.George Hudson, was related to mom, and he was a farmer.One cold hog killing morning, I was leaving to go to school on the bus and I begged Mr. Sturgis to cut out the hog brains for my class to study in biology. He did, but he put them in a small brown paper bag.By the time we got to Stephen Decatur High School, the bag broke through as we got off the bus. My friend Nellie saw it first, screamed, hollered gdead h and everyone ran. I tried to explain to our new principal, but to no avail.He just didn ft understand a country girl fs ambition to succeed in biology.Enough of this. lets cook some delicious meals with pork.Ever heard of pork forshanks?The pork shank is the front forearm of the hog. This cut is tough because the pigs develop muscles living in the mud, which in turn gives the meat incredible flavor that tastes next-level compared to other parts of the hog fs body.The bone it surrounds has marrow that melts into a braise when slow cooked, making it extra rich.Which is perfect for this next recipe.BRAISED PORK SHANK1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 2 tbsps chili powder, 1 tbsp kosher salt (plus more to season), 1 tbsp freshly ground black pepper (plus more to season), 6 pork shanks (about 1 1/2 pounds each), 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil (divided), 1 medium onion (chopped), 2 medium carrots (chopped), 2 medium celery ribs (chopped), 6 garlic cloves (minced), 6 cups chicken stock or low-sodium broth, 3 rosemary sprigs, 2 bay leaves, 2 thyme sprigs. In a large, sturdy resealable plastic bag, combine the flour and chili powder with salt and pepper.Add the pork shanks, one at a time, and shake to coat thoroughly.In a large skillet, heat 2 tbsps of the olive oil until simmering.Add three of the pork shanks and cook over moderately high heat until browned all over, about 10 minutes. Transfer the browned shanks to a deep, heavy casserole. Wipe out the skillet and brown the remaining three pork shanks in the remaining 2 tbsps of olive oil; lower the heat if necessary. Add the pork shanks to the casserole. Add the onion, carrots, celery and garlic to the skillet and cook over moderate heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Simmer until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Pour the vegetables over the pork. Add the stock, rosemary, bay leaves, and thyme; season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Tuck the pork shanks into the liquid so that they fre mostly submerged.Cover and cook over moderately low heat for 2 1/2 hours, or until the meat is very tender. Turn the pork shanks every 30 minutes to keep them submerged in the liquid.Transfer the braised shanks to a large, deep platter; cover and keep warm. Strain the liquid, pressing hard on the solids; discard the solids. Return the liquid to the casserole and boil until reduced to 4 cups, about 20 minutes.Spoon off the fat, pour the pork gravy over the braised shanks, and serve.COUNTRY PORK RIBS3 lb. country style pork ribs (about 8 ribs), 2 tsps smoked salt,. tsp black pepper, 2 tsps smoked paprika, 1 tsp dried thyme,. tsp cayenne pepper. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees. Arrange the ribs in a single layer in an ungreased 9x13-inch rimmed baking dish. Mix together the dry rub ingredients and sprinkle the rub on top of the ribs. Cover the baking dish tightly with heavy duty foil (or a double layer of regular foil), and bake until the ribs are very tender, about 2 hours.With a slotted spatula, remove the cooked ribs to a broiler-safe, foil-lined, rimmed baking sheet.Either flip them or place them on their side, so that the fat is exposed to the heating element.The goal is to brown it. Switch the oven to broil on high, and set an oven rack 6 inches below the heating element (not directly below). Baste the ribs with the pan juices, then broil them until the fat is browned, 3-4 minutes.Baste the ribs one more time with the pan juices and serve.PORK ROAST6-pound boneless Boston Butt (aka pork shoulder), 3 cloves garlic minced, 2 tsps salt, 2 tsps ground pepper, 1 tbsp chopped fresh sage, 1 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary, 2 large red onions (sliced into 1-inch thick wedges), olive oil, 1/2 cup reserved pan drippings. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Tie roast well with kitchen twine and place it in a lightly oiled roasting pan.Rub roast with mix of herbs and garlic and place in roasting pan.Bake in preheated oven, uncovered, for 3 hours. Remove roast from pan and add onions; toss with pan drippings (if there isn ft enough fat in the pan, drizzle with a bit of olive oil and toss onions to coat). Place roast on top of onions and return to the oven, uncovered, for an additional 4 hours (check pan every hour to be sure the pan drippings don ft evaporate. add 2 cups of water if necessary).Remove the roast from the roasting pan and place it in a glass baking dish and allow it to cool before you wrap the dish well with plastic and put it in the fridge overnight.Reserve the onions and pan drippings separately in the fridge overnight too. You should have about 1 1/2 cups of drippings (maybe 1 1/4 after you remove the fat). Add water to the drippings if you don ft have enough.PORK LOIN CHOPS2 tbsp paprika, 1 tbsp salt,. tbsp ground black pepper,. tbsp garlic powder,. tbsp onion powder, 1 tsp dry mustard powder, 1 tsp ground sage,. tsp cayenne pepper (optional),. tsp celery salt (optional). Measure out all of the ingredients into a small mixing bowl. Set aside. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees and lightly grease or spray a baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Wash and trim country-style pork loin chops as needed, then pat the pork dry using paper towels. Apply the pork seasoning to all sides of the pork chops generously. For about 2 lbs of country style pork loin chops, you fd use 2 tbsps of the pork seasoning. Place the seasoned country style pork loin chops into your prepared baking dish in a single layer. Bake in the middle of your oven fs center rack for 35-40 minutes, or until the pork reaches a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees.Remove from the oven and serve immediately for best taste.PULLED PORK1 3lb. pork shoulder roast,. cup beef broth,. cup apple cider vinegar,. chopped yellow onion, 2 tbsps light brown sugar, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tbsp yellow mustard, 1 bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce. Spread chopped onions on the bottom of the slow cooker. Add pork shoulder and pour in chicken broth, Worcestershire and cider vinegar right on the pork. Add mustard and brown sugar and use your hands to rub it all in the pork. Cover the slow cooker and set on high for 5 hours.Shred pork with 2 forks and pour in BBQ sauce. Don ft pour the whole bottle in. Just enough to cover the meat according to taste. Cover and cook on high for 1 more hour.Serve on your favorite sandwich rolls or buns. \n \n Caption: METRO CREATIVE SERVICES\n \nMarie Savage's pork chop recipe features nine different seasonings. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 736\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - In an address to the Maryland Farm Bureau, Maryland Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Atticks focused on the future of the industry.At the Farm Bureau's Annual Convention and Meeting of Delegates Monday afternoon in Cambridge, Atticks discussed the state's agriculture efforts and goals moving forward, along with some of the things it has already implemented.\"I'm acting like we're running out of time,\" he said during his speech.\"You're going to see us moving forward on things in a very proactive way.\"Toward the beginning of his address, Atticks named some of the pressures that Maryland's agriculture industry is facing, including development pressures and pressures related to the Chesapeake Bay. He said those pressures are informing everything the Department of Agriculture does.Regarding land, Atticks said many farms in the state are situated in the midst of a series of metropolitan areas.\"Those metro areas are combining and creating an unworldly amount of pressure for you to sell,\" he said. \"Not crops, but land.\"To preserve these rural areas, Atticks said it is critical that these farms become more profitable.\"We're going to make it more profitable, which will in turn, preserve it,\" he said about the land.Atticks also talked about \"doing well by the Bay and for the Bay.\" He said the state needs to reach and exceed its goals for the Chesapeake Bay.One of the department's efforts, he said, is focusing on blue catfish.\"In parts of the Bay, (blue catfish are) 80% of the biomass,\" he said.The blue catfish are eating crabs, rockfish and oysters - which is a problem for the health of the Bay.\"We're counting on oysters to help us clean the Bay,\" he said. \"And this thing is eating the oysters.\"Atticks had everyone in the audience raise their right hands and repeat, \"I promise to eat 250 pounds of catfish every week.\"\"Come on, this is the interactive portion of the show,\" he said, drawing laughs from those in the audience.Throughout his speech, Atticks talked about value-added agriculture - using processing or packaging so that the product is not sold as an original raw product.He said this is something his department wants to make sure it is supporting so that farmers can increase their profits.\"We've added a state value-added specialist, which will help farmers across the state do some of the work that I've been doing in my prior career,\" he said. \"Help folks get through the systems so that if they want to take their milk and actually sell milkshakes, they can do that.\"Atticks said this does not mean the state is turning its back on traditional agriculture.\"Traditional ag is critically important,\" he said. \"But given the pressures that we're in and the margins that are being squeezed, traditional ag is going to require a lot more acreage.\"Atticks said the department is also working to make its nutrient management program better and modernize all of its programs and processes.\"We've got a very, very large Latino population who's attempting to get into the industry,\" he said. \"And when all of our programs are in English only, that's not going to fly.\"Going to different counties and connecting with community members is another priority for Atticks.\"Because we need to keep having these conversations,\" he said. \"All of the good or bad ideas that we're going to come up with over the next few years are going to be from talking with you.\"After Atticks spoke, Craig Beyrouty, the dean of the University of Maryland College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, spoke. He also discussed the future, focusing on the college's goals.He said that while enrollment has increased for graduate students, undergraduate enrollment has gone down.\"That's a nationwide trend,\" Beyrouty said. \"If anything keeps us up at night, it's attracting more students into our program.\"Beyrouty said the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources has passionate staff and students.\"Our college was ranked, within the last five years, as having one of the top five undergraduate programs in agriculture in the nation in terms of return on investment,\" he said. \"It's an outstanding program We just need to attract more students.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nMaryland Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Atticks discussed the future of Maryland's agriculture industry at the Maryland Farm Bureau Annual Convention and Meeting of Delegates Dec. 4 at the Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay Golf Resort, Spa And Marina in Cambridge. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A celebration of agriculture charity - Foundation supports Eastern Shore ag communities\n\n December 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Laura Tayman; ltayman@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 745\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE - When the board of Chesapeake Charities brainstormed about what they would like to focus on for their 2023 awards ceremony, they chose the most obvious choice for the Maryland Eastern Shore - agriculture.Last week, the organization held its eighth annual awards ceremony with honorees that supported the Maryland agriculture community.Chesapeake Charities is a community foundation, a tax-exempt public charity, for philanthropists to establish charitable funds or donate to a cause they support.With over 160 funds, the foundation works on charitable projects in nine counties: Anne Arundel, Calvert, Caroline, Charles, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's, St. Mary's and Talbot.Working in partnership with donors and advisors, Chesapeake Charities has invested over $28 million in the areas of education, health and human services, community development, the arts, animal welfare, and the environment. This translates to thousands of grants for outstanding projects throughout the Chesapeake Bay region and beyond.\"We also do things like supply an awardee administrative costs, pay their bills, get tax exemption numbers,\" said Scott. \"That way there is more money for them to support their cause.\" \"Every new philanthropist knows that they have a support network allowing only a 4% overhead cost and our new stellar grant office has secured over $32 million,\" said Linda Kohler, Chesapeake Charities' executive director. \"We are really good at multiplication,\" she said.Kevin Atticks, the Maryland Secretary of Agriculture, attended the event and told the audience that \"agriculture and farming is the No. 1 industry in Maryland.\" Atticks said the Moore Administration has made support for rural areas in Maryland one of its top priorities.\"He's been to the Eastern Shore so many times, he's now starting to get calls from municipalities that say they need some attention, too,\" Atticks said.\"Farmers are accused of being commercial these days,\" Atticks said. \"We need to give them tools to make them stronger and the tools to be profitable,\" said Atticks of his department's focus.A familiar name and face was honored this year as the Philanthropist of the Year, Jim Perdue of Perdue Farms.\"It's rare for a business to become bigger with each generation, but that's been the case with Perdue,\" said Atticks. \"Though the business is food based, it's also a people business.\" Perdue is focused on all employees because he worked in every job of the company before taking the lead. He established wellness centers at each Perdue location with medical personnel for workers, all free. His was the first company to commit to no biotics protocol.Just last week the Purdue and the McCormick companies delivered nutritious meals to 5,200 families on the Eastern Shore, and in FY23, his foundation provided nearly $1.7 million to 71 nonprofits focusing efforts on education, agriculture, the environment, health and social services, public safety, and fighting hunger and poverty.When receiving the award, Perdue thanked his family and workers and told attendees, \"I believe giving back is giving hope.\" Amy Cawley, Maryland Food Bank's Farm to Food Bank Program, received the Agricultural Advocate award.Cawley, who grew up on a farm in Denton in Caroline County, said she knew for a long time that lots of fresh food was going to waste.Cawley grew the program from two participating farms in 2011 to 60 farms participating today. \"This is hundreds of thousands of pounds of food that people who were food-insecure wouldn't have received,\" she said. In 2023, Maryland farmers raised 1 million pounds of food in one single season through the program.This next year, Cawley said they are now venturing into dairy and are going to be trying new kinds of vegetables and fruits to grow to be mindful of foods other cultures eat.This year's Nonprofit of the Year award went to Wild Kid Acres owned by Gerardo Martinez.The Maryland Grain Producers Utilization Board, headquartered in Queenstown in Queen Anne's County, won the Charities' Volunteers of the Year award - a group of farmers helping farmers, who has funded more than $26 million in grants to improve the profitability and sustainability of state agriculture and farm families.One of their most notable projects was providing Maryland Public Television with a series about the lives of Maryland farmers. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF CHESAPEAKE CHARITIES\n \nMaryland Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Atticks congratulates Amy Cawley, director of the Maryland Food Bank's Farm to Food Bank program, who received this year's Chesapeake Charities Advocate Award.\n \nLAURA TAYMAN\n \nJessica, Zaria, and Gerardo Martinez accept the Nonprofit of the Year Award for their Wild Acre Farm in Edgewater, from Chesapeake Charities last week. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Montaire starts a new era of grain storage on the Shore\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 475\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n MILLSBORO, Del. — Mountaire Farms paid about $25 million for three grain elevators in a deal reach in December.The grain facilities — located in Preston, Cordova and Wye Mills — were purchased from Nagel Farm Services. According to the deed the multiple properties in Wye Mills and Preston were sold for $18.5 million. It includes six different properties. Another grain silo property in Cordova sold for $6.4 million, according to county special warranty deeds.\n\"Our intention is to operate these facilities with the same level of exceptional service that local farmers have come to expect from Nagel Farms,\" said Rex Holstein, vice president of agri-business for Mountaire Farms, at the time the deal was made. \"At Mountaire, we are a family-owned company just like the Nagels, and we share similar values. We appreciate how they've managed their business through the years, and we can't wait to continue that legacy.\"\nMountaire will work with Nagel employees on transitioning their employment, benefits and seniority to Mountaire.\nAccording to a Nagel-produced documentary, their culture is faith-based with a focus on doing the right thing by everyone they do business with.\nNagel Farm Service will retain their trucking, hardware and crop insurance businesses at the three Mid-Shore locations.\n\"They are still retaining some of their operations. We are just buying the grain storage facilities — the grain elevators. Crop insurance is not our expertise. That is not anything we would be interested in,\" said Bassett.\n\"Our agribusiness team buys and sells grain. We use the bulk of it to make chicken feed, certainly at our feed mills here on the shore. More storage capacity means the capacity to buy more local grain. That is important to our team. Sometimes there are other opportunities to buy and sell local grain. Our agri business team watches closely how grain is bought and sold,\" she said.\nMountaire currently owns nine grain elevators on Delmarva and three feed mills.\n\"The Nagel family and our team of trusted employees will continue to work together serving the farm community with the same level of care we have for nearly 80 years,\" said the Nagel family in a statement. \"We are proud of the strong bond we have with our loyal customers and look forward to improving these relationships through unparalleled service. Mountaire, as an organization, is an excellent fit with Nagel Farm Service as we both operate from two critical principles: 1) prioritizing faith and 2) providing exceptional service to the farmer.\"\nA Dec. 18 fire at the Wye Mills grain silo was put out quickly, and according to Catherine Bassett, director of communications at Mountaire, they were back to work the next day.\nThose towering grain silos shimmered as the sun set and a new era began as the deal was inked. The $5 billion dollar poultry business on Delmarva keeps growing. These grain facilities are key locations for farmers on the Mid-Shore. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Solar on Eastern Shore farmland raise concerns\n\n January 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEVE KLINE | Section: Columns \n \n 497\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For 33 years, Eastern Shore Land Conservancy has welcomed each new year with a strong spirit of mission, to work each day to conserve this special place we all hold dear. This year is no different, as we return to the office after a restful break among family and friends.We are proud of our accomplishments in 2023 and move ahead focused on the many opportunities to protect the Eastern Shore in 2024.\nThis particular new year dawns with an urgent issue on the horizon: the siting of commercial-scale solar on Eastern Shore farmland. As the General Assembly prepares for the 2024 legislative session, solar siting policy is a high priority for many, as the state seeks to meet aggressive renewable energy goals, while also continuing to make progress on land conservation.\nGround-mounted solar projects can run from a few dozen acres to several hundred, and across the Potomac in Virginia, some individual solar projects are slated to consume thousands of acres of farmland, forest and open space. Some look to Maryland's Eastern Shore and see similar possibilities, with acre after acre of generally flat agricultural land suited perfectly for solar energy generation.\nBut Eastern Shore Land Conservancy is encouraging state lawmakers to move ahead cautiously. The University of Maryland estimates that our state has lost about half of its agricultural land in the last 50 years, and the American Farmland Trust estimates that in the coming decades, Maryland will likely lose more than 100,000 additional acres.\nWhile estimates vary widely, the legislated renewable energy goals that already exist seem likely to require between 10,000 and 20,000 acres of ground-mounted solar on agricultural fields. This doesn't include the acreage that could be affected by expanded transmission lines, substations, and other energy grid infrastructure.\nGiven the state landscape, one can imagine the majority of those acres — and perhaps the vast majority — could fall on Eastern Shore farmland, unless steps to ensure regional equity are taken. This is why, as legislators prepare to gather and address the business of the state, ESLC is advocating for a few priority policies related to solar siting.\nFirst, commercial solar development should never be allowed on state-held or co-held conservation easements.\nSecond, solar siting should be prioritized for the built environment. We shouldn't be losing some of the most productive soil in the world while warehouses and parking lots go unutilized.\nThird, for every acre taken out of production for solar development, solar companies should be paying a mitigation fee to conserve lands via permanent easement elsewhere.\nLastly, policies should be enacted to ensure Maryland's Eastern Shore counties aren't expected to bear a disproportionate burden of solar development in the coming years.\nAs we navigate the changing climate, the need to decarbonize our economy and transition to a renewable energy future is abundantly clear. But what is also abundantly clear is that climate change will make Eastern Shore food production even more globally important.\nWe should think long and hard before we place too much Eastern Shore farmland under a solar panel. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Arthur Ellis (D-Charles) introduced a bill on the first day of the General Assembly that would create something that Maryland has never had before — a state fruit.Native to Maryland, persimmons can be found just about everywhere in the state, with the exception of Garrett County due to the mountainous nature of the region.\nIn May and June, persimmon trees flower, but the fruit isn't ready until the fall, leading to many seasonal recipes and drinks. Persimmons have especially been used for fine wines, jams and baked goods.\nThe trees are known for their resilience, being able to thrive for years when they are below the canopy of a forest.\nPrices for persimmons have gone up significantly in recent years, reaching about $6 per pound, and many have not heard how easy it may be to source their own, according to Ellis.\n\"I have persimmon trees in my yard,\" Ellis said. \"They grow naturally, and they're beautiful and delicious.\"\nEllis introduced the legislation to raise awareness for the fruit, as many Marylanders do not realize it is a part of their state and its history.\nIndigenous people of the region used the fruit not only for food but medicinally as well. Sore throats and indigestion were common ailments that the use of persimmons attempted to treat.\nThroughout the Civil War, persimmon seeds were used as a coffee substitute when trade routes were impacted.\nThe usefulness of the persimmon tree doesn't end with the fruit. The wood of the tree is extremely strong, and is commonly used within shoes, golf clubs, flooring and musical instruments.\nIf Senate Bill 74 makes it through both state legislative houses and is signed by the governor, it would become effective Oct. 1.\nTwitter: @MattSoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cardin visits Teddy Bear Fresh during Eastern Shore tour\n\n February 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 556\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin came to visit the Eastern Shore to discuss agriculture and aquaculture on Monday. His first stop was on Glebe Road to tour the Teddy Bear Fresh Produce facility.The group took a chilly 39-degree tour of Teddy Bear Fresh. The refrigeration was loud as they passed boxes of strawberries and kosher dill spears.\nMary Salins, the owner of Teddy Bear Fresh, a produce and foodservice item provider, has been looking for a way to expand her family business for seven years, she said.\nThe facility helps the year-round agricultural cycle by providing a market with vast refrigerated storage. Farmers don't need to get stuck with produce they can't sell, and Salins can sell wholesale to school systems, health care facilities, restaurants and others, with her trucks moving the vegetables to locations farther away.\nThis supports the cycles that farms naturally work in but provides a longer shelf life for their produce, Salins said.\nCardin said, \"You are providing stability to farmers. You are giving them a market. We are so supportive of local sourcing and making that a reality.\"\nSalins wrote in an email, \"The non profit ESEC (Eastern Shore Entrepreneurship Center) received that money. Mike Thielke stated that he was with ESEC when he talked about those funds. Teddy Bear Fresh has not received any state funds. We are hoping to collaborate with ESEC in the near future.\"\nThielke is the Executive Director of ESEC.\nMike Thielke further clarified in an email, \"Yes it was a grant to ESEC. It was submitted for funding by both Sen. Ben Cardin and Sen. Van Hollen. ESEC applied for a USDA grant in support of creating a regional produce processing and aggregation facility.\"\nHe went on to write, \"ESEC and Teddy Bear Fresh have agreed to work together on creating the processing/aggregating facility. ESEC alone could bring about the facility. ESEC is bringing to the table the grant funds it has received and combining it with TBF's expertise and resources.\"\n$985,000 is the size of the grant.\n\"It is going to be larger than this building,\" Salins said. \"We will have a processing center as well as a larger freezer. We distribute out in wholesale, because of where we are, we have a lot of farms to pick up from.\"\nAt Teddy Bear Fresh, Cardin joined Letitia Nichols, deputy state director of USDA Rural Development for Maryland and Delaware; Scott Warner, executive director of the Mid Shore Regional Council; and local leaders.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook, Director of Economic Development and Tourism in Talbot Cassandra Van Hooser and Mike Detmer, representing Rep. Andy Harris' office, were also in attendance.\nFollowing the tour of Teddy Bear Fresh, Cardin traveled to Chesapeake College to host a roundtable discussion with representatives from the Shore's agriculture, aquaculture and environmental conservation communities.\nFollowing the discussion, Cardin joined individuals featured in the Maryland Public Television documentary, \"Water's Edge: Black Watermen of the Chesapeake\" to hear from them and better understand the plight of Black watermen, their history on the Shore and what, if any role, the U.S. government can play to help.\nFor the final event of the day, Cardin visited TechOps Specialty Vehicles, a business that specializes in the design and production of a wide variety of mobile vehicle-based solutions, for a tour of the facility. TechOps is headquartered in Stevensville and has several federal vehicle contracts.\nThis has been an updated version. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In an interview, Meekins said the loss of income that farmers are facing due to this problem are \"very great.\"\nAlthough some people say saltwater intrusion is due to sinking ground, Meekins largely attributes it to erosion.\n\"We're seeing hundreds of acres in 10 years time that are eroding away,\" he said. \"And that's causing sediment to decrease the depth of the rivers and creeks and tributaries.\"\nAs a result, he said, areas that don't normally flood are becoming flooded.\nMeekins said subsurface saltwater intrusion, where saltwater is getting into ground water, is also an issue.\nRobert Ferrier, series producer for Maryland Farm and Harvest, said low-lying counties are especially susceptible to these problems with saltwater.\n\"While it only affects a small portion of our state, it's something that I think everyone needs to be aware of,\" he said.\nFerrier said this issue has become more prevalent with sea level rise and increasing tide levels.\n\"It's something that we have to pay attention to,\" he said.\nAnd this problem is not one that solely affects the farming community.\n\"Anybody that lives near a waterway has trouble with tidal flows,\" Meekins said. \"Homes are getting flooded out. It's just becoming an increasing problem — for not only the farmer, but for the homeowner.\"\nThis segment is one of three in the episode. The episode also shows how a Harford County family is working to grow and sustain its farm and gets into locally produced wines at a vineyard in Frederick County.\nMaryland Farm and Harvest, which is in its 11th season, tells a variety of stories about agriculture in Maryland.\nThe episode will also be available on mpt.org/farm on Feb. 13. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The virus affects chickens, ducks and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds and raptors.\nThe birds affected in the backyard flock in Charles County included 27 chickens, one duck and one goose, according to Jessica Hackett, director of communications at MDA.\nNeither Hackett nor other local and state officials contacted would say what town the flock was located in.\nOfficials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties are being or have been humanely depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease, according to Hackett.\nMDA will not release the location of the flock \"for security purposes,\" Hackett said.\nThe last time the disease was detected in the state was last fall when avian influenza was found in a broiler operation in Caroline County. Before that, cases were found in spring 2022 on the Eastern Shore and fall 2022 in an Anne Arundel County backyard flock.\n\"The latest non-negative result should serve as a reminder for all poultry growers, operators and backyard flock owners to remain vigilant when it comes to the threat of HPAI, especially as the spring migratory season begins,\" Maryland Department of Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks said. \"Regardless of flock size, biosecurity remains the most effective way to prevent the spread of this disease among poultry.\"\nJonathan Moyle, a poultry specialist for the University of Maryland Extension, said that there's a low risk of transmission to humans and that the birds found to be infected will likely be euthanized.\nMoyle suggested that as birds begin migrating north, people should keep their poultry cooped to not let migratory birds infected with the disease spread it further.\nTo help prevent the spread of avian flu, the Maryland Department of Agriculture recommends cleaning and disinfecting transportation, removing loose feed, keeping visitors to a minimum, washing hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry, providing disposable boot covers or disinfectant foot baths for anyone having contact with a flock, changing clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property and cleaning and disinfecting tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility.\nTwitter: @MattSoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In other words, margins could be small if the prices stay at the low end of the estimate.\nWilley's presentation touched on wheat and weather. He said he didn't have any positive insights on wheat supply and use.\n\"So many Mid-Atlantic mills have closed,\" he said. \"What's been going on across the country is it's just not a pleasant deal.\"\nWilley said that in 2001, the United States had a total of 63 million acres of wheat. The estimate for 2024 and 2025 is 16 million less acres.\nTouching on climate change, Willey said extreme weather is becoming the norm.\n\"Don't be a climate denier,\" he said. \"There are a lot of people that are still denying that we have a climate problem. It's real.\"\nMichael Bostic Jr., a farmer in Church Hill, said he was not surprised by Willey's insights.\n\"It's our job to keep up on stuff like this,\" he said. \"It's all been in the pipeline for a while.\"\nBostic, who grows corn, wheat and soybeans, said he is trying to stay optimistic about what's to come this year.\n\"But it's not going to be great,\" he said.\nAt the end of his presentation, Willey encouraged the farmers in the audience to consider their supply chain in relation to value chain, or how much money is in a product.\n\"When somebody buys it, how much money does that generate and what percentage of it do you get?\" he said, explaining what value chain is.\nWilley encouraged the audience to consider artificial intelligence's place in all this.\n\"You guys are really good at knowing what your costs are,\" he said. \"With AI, I think we're going to find a way to not only know what the costs are, but we're going to find out, not only the supply chain, but what the value chain is. And remember, other people will be able to figure out what your portion of the value chain is.\"\nWilley said he thinks that in the next four or five years, there will be a trend in people deciding they want to raise prices on the things that go into producing a crop.\n\"Because there's so much money in the value chain, and they want more of it,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Van Hollen hears from Eastern Shore farmers on Farm Bill\n\n March 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 642\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n QUEENSTOWN — On a trip to the Eastern Shore Friday, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) heard from local farmers and members of agricultural organizations on what is most important to them when it comes to the Farm Bill.The Farm Bill is a package of legislation that includes various agriculture and nutrition programs, from crop insurance to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The federal bill needs to be reauthorized. In November, the bill was extended to allow programs to continue through Sept. 30.\nThe roundtable at Wye Research and Education Center was the final stop on Van Hollen's tour Friday. He also visited Tilghman Island Seafood with Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) for a blue catfish processing tour, went to For All Seasons in Easton to learn more about mental health, education and rape crisis services provided in the Mid-Shore and visited J.M. Clayton Seafood Company in Cambridge to tour and talk with seafood processors about the H-2B visa program.\nMaryland Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Atticks joined for the roundtable discussion with farmers Friday afternoon in Queenstown.\nVan Hollen said the purpose of the roundtable was to hear to everyone else in the room. In an interview after the roundtable, he said these listening sessions help inform decisions made on Capitol Hill.\nThe roundtable was made up of Eastern Shore farmers and members of organizations such as the Maryland Farm Bureau and Horizon Farm Credit.\n\"They're in the best position to know what changes we need to make to update the Farm Bill,\" Van Hollen said in the interview. \"We reauthorize the Farm Bill from time to time, and the whole reason we go through that process is because things change. And so, it's our opportunity to update programs, to add new things, to get rid of things that are no longer necessary.\"\nDuring the discussion, members of the roundtable went around the room, sharing their interests and concerns when it comes to the Farm Bill.\nAndy Mason, a dairy farmer in Kent County, spoke about the importance of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and risk management programs.\n\"My other thing would be to get it done,\" he said. \"That's obviously a political issue at this point, but our livelihoods and businesses are very much impacted by the Farm Bill.\"\nJennie Schmidt of Schmidt Farms in Queen Anne's County said that when it comes to crop insurance, better coverage is needed for vegetable and specialty crops. She said that when it comes to vegetables, the Farm Bill crop insurance program has good coverage for processing vegetables, but not for fresh market vegetables.\nJonathan Quinn, a Kent County grain farmer and vice president of the Maryland Farm Bureau, called crop insurance a key part of farm operations.\n\"It doesn't pay all the bills, but it keeps us going,\" he said. \"So that is one of the things that need to be at the forefront.\"\nLindsay Thompson, owner of Thompson Ag Consulting, brought up technical assistance programming. She asked for language in the bill that will make it so that certified crop advisors automatically become technical service providers. She said this language was included in the 2018 Farm Bill but was never implemented.\nMarshal Cahall, a grain farmer in Kent and Queen Anne's counties and District 5 director of the Maryland Farm Bureau, said the Farm Bill should be thought of as a food security bill. He said it's important to think about the connection between SNAP benefits and the farm programs that contribute to a secure supply of food for the American consumer.\nToward the end of the roundtable, Atticks spoke about coordination and collaboration, saying that a lot of money is going into food security programs and a lot of money is going into supporting local farmers.\n\"If the folks we were giving the money to to support the food programs had to buy local,\" he said, \"we wouldn't have to support farmers as much.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Cage-free egg bill cracks under pressure",

    "content": "Cage-free egg bill cracks under pressure\n\n March 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KIERSTEN HACKER Capital News Service | Section: General Assembly \n \n 760\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — A bill promoting cage-free eggs once got people excited but now it's stuck in committee, leaving sponsors uncertain if its future is on the sunny side.The measure would require all shell eggs raised or sold in Maryland to be cage-free by 2026. This would prohibit Maryland farmers with over 3,000 egg-laying hens from using what's known as battery cages, or conventional wire cages where hens are kept in close confinement.\nThe law would also require any eggs sold in Maryland supplied by other states to be cage-free.\n\"I think that we should be treating animals humanely,\" said House lead sponsor Del. Jennifer Terrasa (D-Howard County). \"I think that's the bottom line.\"\nBut despite early optimism, Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick), the Senate sponsor, tells Capital News Service she doesn't expect the bill to advance this session, even though she thinks cage-free eggs are \"inevitable.\"\nA stalemate would be at least a short-term win for agricultural interests in their ongoing national fight with animal rights advocates. The Humane Society has been advocating for cage-free eggs across the country, recently launching a six-figure advertising campaign for this legislation in Maryland. Some farms have adopted cage-free practices voluntarily.\nMany farmers are against putting the requirement in law because of the increased cost of production, short phase-in period and potential for their birds to experience heightened health risks outside of the cage.\nFarmers want to make their own decisions for how to best raise their birds.\nSome advocates are surprised the legislation hasn't been successful in Maryland as other states passed similar laws regarding cages for farm animals. It's \"rare\" for Maryland to be behind on humane legislation, said Jennifer Bevan-Dangel, Maryland state director for the Humane Society of the United States.\n\"We've looked at what we consider the cruelest confinement practices,\" Bevan-Dangel said. \"And these battery cages are one of the most inhumane tools that are still being used when we look at the farm animal landscape.\"\nIf the bill were to pass, it's estimated that six million birds would come out of cages, Bevan-Dangel said. About 11 farms that produce shell eggs in Maryland meet the criteria of 3,000 egg-laying hens, Bevan-Dangel said, but the sale prohibition would affect birds in other states as well.\nAccording to state numbers, approximately 600 million eggs were produced in Maryland in 2022. About 10 million of those eggs came from smaller farms with fewer than 3,000 hens, which Bevan-Dangel said often use cage-free practices anyway.\nBut the farming community has pushed back on the legislation vigorously, citing financial concerns they say could put them out of business. Should surrounding states decide not to ban battery cages, Maryland farmers could be disadvantaged in the egg market, said Tyler Hough, director of government relations for the Maryland Farm Bureau.\n\"We would be forced out of business, our employees out of work,\" said Bill Dix of ISE America, a Maryland-based egg producer.\nSome opponents argue there are cases where cage-free housing systems could even have negative effects on the welfare of hens. Access to the ground and other birds means more exposure to diseases, parasites and pecking order injuries, said veterinarian Matthew Weeman, legislative chairman for the Maryland Veterinary Medical Association.\nThe Maryland Veterinary Medical Association did not take a position on the bill but submitted informational testimony. Sometimes a cage is better for a bird and sometimes it isn't, said Weeman.\n\"We don't need a legislative mandate that says here you have to raise the bird this one way because that one way may not stand the test of time in perpetuity,\" Weeman said.\nMany supporters of the bill argue that the egg industry is increasingly shifting toward cage-free practices anyway. By June 2023, according to the USDA, the share of cage-free hens increased to 38% of egg-laying hens in the U.S. Even large restaurant and grocery chains have made cage-free commitments, thus contributing to the increase in cage-free practices.\nWeeman says this shift is not by industry choice, but instead by the work of activist groups. Some farmers are just giving in to the public pressure, he said.\nMandating cage-free eggs could price people out of buying eggs, farmers argue. In a 2023 report, the United Egg Producers determined that if regular eggs are taken from the market, the number of consumers who will forgo buying eggs will increase by 20 percentage points.\nBut Terrasa said this legislation would remove the cost of the premium for cage-free eggs, thus opening access to all Marylanders.\n\"I paid for it, that's fine,\" Terrasa said. \"But I think everybody should be able to make that same ethical decision without the cost of the premium on it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Biden butchered this decision': Democrats split over U.S. lifting ban on Paraguayan beef imports\n\n March 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG Newspapers | Section: National \n \n 1037\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The six Democratic senators representing the Delmarva Peninsula voted against a measure that would reverse the Biden administration's decision to allow beef imports into the U.S. from Paraguay.The U.S. Senate voted 70-25 Thursday to reverse the administration's move to lift longstanding prohibitions on Paraguayan beef imports in an effort led by U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana.\nThe agricultural and trade battle has divided Democrats and comes as U.S. beef prices could hit all-time record highs this year with production inventories at their lowest levels since the 1950s.\nThe White House \"strongly opposes\" the reversal in an issue that has split Democrats saying it will undermine U.S. trade relations including with Paraguay which has taken pro-U.S. stances related to Russia and China.\nParaguayan beef imports that been prohibited into the U.S. for the past 25 years over concerns about foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture reversed that ban in November.\nTester and other critics of the change — including U.S. farm groups — worry about impacts on U.S. food supplies.\nThe Senate vote saw Democrats split on the issue with 26 favoring reversing the Biden decision — Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York along with Tester and U.S. Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jacky Rosen of Nevada. The latter trio all face tough reelection bids in November.\nTwenty-two Democrats — including Maryland's Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, Delaware's Chris Coons and Tom Carper and Virginia's Mark Warner and Tim Kaine — sided with Biden's meat move.\n\"President Biden butchered this decision,\" said Tester, in a statemetn. \"By cutting corners to resume beef imports from a country with a recent history of foot and mouth disease, the Biden Administration is jeopardizing our food supply and giving Montana consumers and producers a raw deal. We cannot allow beef imports from Paraguay until we have data that shows they are meeting same high animal health standards as American ranchers, and I'm proud to have secured overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate to force the Biden administration to reverse course.\"\n'MUST BE HALTED'\nThe measure still needs to pass the U.S. House.\nMost Senate Republicans — including South Dakota'a Mike Rounds, Montana's Steve Daines and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky — vote re-impose the Paraguayan beef ban.\nRounds was the prime GOP sponsor of the measure.\nU.S. agriculture and cattle industry groups — including the Livestock Marketing Association, National Farmers Union and R-CALF USA, also want Congress to nix the Biden administration's decision.\n\"The last time U.S. government officials stepped foot in a Paraguayan meat processing facility was in 2014. That nearly ten-year gap since the last site visit does not inspire confidence in Paraguay's animal health and food safety protocols,\" said Justin Tupper, president of U.S. Cattlemen's Association (USCA).\nThe group warns a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak (FMD) could cause as much as $99 billion in economic damages in the U.S.\nAgriculture groups in Tester's home state — including the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, Montana Farmers Union and Montana Stockgrowers Association — also backed the Senate measure.\n\"Until it can be absolutely proven that there is no risk of an infectious animal disease outbreak in the U.S. domestic animal population caused by these imports, they must be halted,\" said Cyndi Johnson, president of the Montana Farm Bureau.\nWHITE HOUSE PUSHES BACK\nThe Biden administration issued a statement to Congress March 19 opposing the Tester and Rounds-led measure.\n\"The administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res. 62, which would disapprove of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) action to allow imports of fresh beef from Paraguay into the United States. USDA conducted a rigorous scientific evaluation including site visits, a full risk analysis, and ongoing review of the region's animal health status and concluded that the risk of fresh beef imports from Paraguay is low,\" the White House said.\n\"If enacted, S.J. Res. 62 would undermine the credibility of long-standing science-based decision-making processes respected by the U.S. and upheld in our trade agreements, and could in turn severely threaten fair access to new and existing export markets for U.S. farmers and ranchers,\" the White House statement to Congress continued.\nThe U.S. administration said the measure would indefinitely ban Paraguayan beef imports and \"mark a significant setback in the United States-Paraguay bilateral relationship and U.S. credibility as a reliable economic partner across Latin America.\"\nThe White House said a pullback could have national security and geopolitical ramifications, pointing to Paraguay's condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and standing as the last South American country recognizing Taiwan.\nChina, in particular, has been making significant investments in Latin America and other developing regions. Russia restricted Paraguayan imports after the Ukraine rebuke.\nThe Biden administration was re-instituting a U.S. ban could send Paraguay into the economic arms of Moscow and/or Beijing.\n\"Access to the U.S. market is critical for Paraguay to recover exports lost to Russia and to withstand pressure from the PRC to withdraw diplomatic recognition of Taiwan,\" the White House contends.\nParaguayan beef imports would be a small slice of of the total U.S. market — 0.05% of the total market and 0.5% of imports, according to an October 2023 analysis by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The USDA arm also defended its decision to ease the ban.\nRECORD HIGH BEEF PRICES?\nThe dustup over Paraguay beef imports also comes as U.S. beef production has been dropping and prices are on the rise.\nBeef and veal prices were up 7.4% in February compared to a year ago, according to the Consumer Price Index.\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation said beef prices could hit record highs with supplies at their lowest since 1951.\nThe Farm Bureau said there were 87.2 million heads of cattle in the U.S. in January. That's down the 8.9% from four years ago and the lowest inventories in 73 years.\n\"Farmers have been driven to sell off cattle because of severe drought conditions and the rising cost of supplies needed to support their herds. There are now fewer female cattle available for breeding, which means it will take time to restock the cattle population, AFBF said in a statement.\n\"The latest cattle numbers are a stark reminder of the challenges facing America's farmers and ranchers,\" said AFBF President Zippy Duvall. \"Severe weather, high inflation and geopolitical uncertainty are taking a toll on farmers across the country, and families will see the effects in their grocery bills.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And they truly love what they're doing,\" he said.\nAlways on the lookout for agriculture stories, after his team met Jenell, Ferrier knew there was a great story to tell.\n\"The McHenrys personify the current crop of young farmers,\" Ferrier remarked. \"They're great people.\"\nMPT spent about three hours shooting at the McHenry property, a farm that has been in Kennedyville since 1965, with Associate Producer Luke Fisher writing the script. In a fast turnaround, the episode was created in roughly three weeks.\nFurther into the episode, Clendining informed the audience that farming is one of the most dangerous professions.\nThe McHenrys can certainly attest.\nIn his own words, Joe talked about how sudden his accident happened.\nNov. 5, 2022, at 6:30 a.m., Joe said they just had two weeks of terrible harvesting conditions. He was stressed, driving his tractor on US state 298, and had just glanced away to look at the dew on the soybeans.\nIn that flash of a moment things changed.\nHis wheels hit fresh gravel, and the rear end of the tractor kicked out, flipping into the ditch.\n\"I wasn't sure if I yanked the wheel, but that was the last thing I remembered until I woke up,\" Joe recounts.\nHe sustained a broken pelvis, dislodged spine, a puncture wound and internal bleeding.\n\"I was in a bad place,\" Joe acknowledged. Jenell can clearly remember the disconcerting events.\nAs emergency services rushed to the scene, she got a text from Joe's sister, asking if Joe was helping assist with the accident.\nJenell tried to contact her husband, and when she didn't receive a response, she felt something awful just happened.\nHer fears were realized, when she arrived by the roadside to see the flipped tractor and her husband being loaded in the ambulance.\nJoe came to before he blacked out again, with the familiar voice of a first responder, a friend's, fading. He awoke again at Christiana Care emergency room before being placed in a medicated coma to allow for healing.\nJenell prayed.\n\"I asked the good Lord to keep him breathing with no brain injuries, and that's what I got,\" she said.\nWith his friends and family praying, Joe underwent an experimental surgery where rods and plates were placed to help him walk again.\nAs MPT's narrator put it, \"He would spend the next 37 days in the hospital before moving to rehab.\"\nJoe did recover, with friends, his employees, and the community at his side.\nFrom strong adversity, the McHenry's keep going. Something that amazes Ferrier, even after his years of working for companies like Discovery, visiting exotic locales.\nMore than 16 million viewers have watched \"Maryland Farm and Harvest\" since its debut in 2013, Ferrier said.\n\"We celebrate agriculture in all its forms. Whatever you raise, grow or pick, we love telling the stories.\"\nView episodes on MPT Tuesdays at 7 p.m., or past episodes at video.mpt.tv/show/maryland-farm-harvest/.

Jon Tester, D-Montana.\nThe agricultural and trade battle has divided Democrats and comes as U.S. beef prices could hit all-time record highs this year with production inventories at their lowest levels since the 1950s.\nThe White House \"strongly opposes\" the reversal, saying it will undermine U.S. trade relations including with Paraguay which has taken pro-U.S. stances related to Russia and China.\nParaguayan beef imports have been prohibited in the U.S. for the past 25 years over concerns about foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture reversed that ban in November.\nTester and other critics of the change — including U.S. farm groups — worry about impacts on U.S. food supplies.\nThe Senate vote saw Democrats split on the issue with 26 favoring reversing the Biden decision — including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York along with Tester and U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jacky Rosen of Nevada. The latter trio all face tough reelection bids in November.\nTwenty-two Democrats — including Maryland's Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, Delaware's Chris Coons and Tom Carper and Virginia's Mark Warner and Tim Kaine — sided with Biden's meat move.\nDemocratic senators from California, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Connecticut split on the beef imports vote.\nThe split is less familiar territory for Democrats who often vote in lockstep on many issues.\n\"President Biden butchered this decision,\" said Tester in a statement. \"By cutting corners to resume beef imports from a country with a recent history of foot and mouth disease, the Biden Administration is jeopardizing our food supply and giving Montana consumers and producers a raw deal. We cannot allow beef imports from Paraguay until we have data that shows they are meeting same high animal health standards as American ranchers, and I'm proud to have secured overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate to force the Biden administration to reverse course.\"\n'MUST BE HALTED'\nThe measure still needs to pass the U.S. House.\nMost Senate Republicans — including South Dakota'a Mike Rounds, Montana's Steve Daines and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky — voted to re-impose the Paraguayan beef ban.\nRounds was the prime GOP sponsor of the measure.\nU.S. agriculture and cattle industry groups — including the Livestock Marketing Association, National Farmers Union and R-CALF USA — also want Congress to nix the Biden administration's decision.\n\"The last time U.S. government officials stepped foot in a Paraguayan meat processing facility was in 2014. That nearly ten-year gap since the last site visit does not inspire confidence in Paraguay's animal health and food safety protocols,\" said Justin Tupper, president of U.S. Cattlemen's Association (USCA).\nThe group warns a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak (FMD) could cause as much as $99 billion in economic damages in the U.S.\nAgriculture groups in Tester's home state — including the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, Montana Farmers Union and Montana Stockgrowers Association — also backed the Senate measure.\n\"Until it can be absolutely proven that there is no risk of an infectious animal disease outbreak in the U.S. domestic animal population caused by these imports, they must be halted,\" said Cyndi Johnson, president of the Montana Farm Bureau.\nWHITE HOUSE PUSHES BACK\nThe Biden administration issued a statement to Congress March 19 opposing the Tester and Rounds-led measure.\n\"The administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res. 62, which would disapprove of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) action to allow imports of fresh beef from Paraguay into the United States. USDA conducted a rigorous scientific evaluation including site visits, a full risk analysis, and ongoing review of the region's animal health status and concluded that the risk of fresh beef imports from Paraguay is low,\" the White House said.\n\"If enacted, S.J. Res. 62 would undermine the credibility of long-standing science-based decision-making processes respected by the U.S. and upheld in our trade agreements, and could in turn severely threaten fair access to new and existing export markets for U.S. farmers and ranchers,\" the White House statement to Congress continued.\nThe U.S. administration said the measure would indefinitely ban Paraguayan beef imports and \"mark a significant setback in the United States-Paraguay bilateral relationship and U.S. credibility as a reliable economic partner across Latin America.\"\nThe White House said a pullback could have national security and geopolitical ramifications, pointing to Paraguay's condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and standing as the last South American country recognizing Taiwan.\nChina, in particular, has been making significant investments in Latin America and other developing regions. Russia restricted Paraguayan imports after the Ukraine rebuke.\nThe Biden administration warns re-instituting a U.S. ban could send Paraguay into the economic arms of Moscow and/or Beijing.\n\"Access to the U.S. market is critical for Paraguay to recover exports lost to Russia and to withstand pressure from the PRC to withdraw diplomatic recognition of Taiwan,\" the White House contends.\nParaguayan beef imports would be a small slice of the total U.S. market — 0.05% of the total market and 0.5% of imports, according to an October 2023 analysis by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The USDA arm also defended its decision to ease the ban.\nRECORD HIGH BEEF PRICES?\nThe dustup over Paraguay beef imports also comes as U.S. beef production has been dropping and prices are on the rise.\nBeef and veal prices were up 7.4% in February compared to a year ago, according to the Consumer Price Index.\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation said beef prices could hit record highs with supplies at their lowest since 1951.\nThe Farm Bureau said there were 87.2 million heads of cattle in the U.S. in January. That's down the 8.9% from four years ago and the lowest inventories in 73 years.\n\"Farmers have been driven to sell off cattle because of severe drought conditions and the rising cost of supplies needed to support their herds. There are now fewer female cattle available for breeding, which means it will take time to restock the cattle population, AFBF said in a statement.\n\"The latest cattle numbers are a stark reminder of the challenges facing America's farmers and ranchers,\" said AFBF President Zippy Duvall. \"Severe weather, high inflation and geopolitical uncertainty are taking a toll on farmers across the country, and families will see the effects in their grocery bills.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County farmers markets ready for spring season\n\n April 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 667\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As sure as bumblebees circling blossoms, the opening of Mid-Shore farmers markets is a sign of spring.The fresh and local offerings will start this weekend in St. Michaels and next weekend in Easton.\nThe Easton Farmers Market, opening on April 20, will be open on Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.\nAccording to Marie Pierre Nuthall, the outdoor event manager for the Avalon Foundation, which runs the Easton Farmers Market, the weekly event is about supporting local artisans, bakers, farmers, watermen and more.\n\"Farmers markets are important because they support local small businesses,\" Nathall said. \"The money is kept in the community. Everything you see is either grown here or produced here. Nothing is flown in. It is supporting and sustaining our own food production on the Shore.\"\nThe full scale market opening on April 20 will be an expansion of the Avalon Foundation's Winter Market, which it has run in the off-season. The full market will run until the second week of December, after which the Winter Market will pick back up.\n\"This year was the first that we went all year round with some vendors. This constitutes the opening of the Spring Market in its full glory as we expand to fill the entire municipal lot,\" Nuthall said. \"We have lots of vegetables because many of our farmers are growing in high tunnels. We do have vendors there this Saturday, but the full market won't open until April 20.\"\nThe market is located in a municipal parking lot on the 100 block of North Harrison Street in downtown Easton.\nSome of the vendors include Triangle Acres, Cottingham Farm, Honeybee Flower Farm, The Federal Brewing Company, CD Produce, Quarter Acre Farm and Gingersnap Farm.\nThe market will have several bakeries, produce growers and local honey. It will have woodworking and textile crafts for sale, along with other locally-made goods. There will be live music every Saturday starting at 10:30 a.m.\nAn interactive map of vendors is available at maps.managemymarket.\nNuthall said in addition to being able to view the roster of vendors for the duration of the calendar year, those who visit the link can also view vendor contact information, the types of items they sell and their location in the market.\nThere is parking available at Brewer's Lane, or the lot on the corner of Washington and Bay Streets. There will be a marked accessible parking space for those with disability parking needs.\nThe St. Michaels Farmers Market will be open from April 13 to Nov. 23 on Saturdays from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. It is located on 206 S. Talbot Street.\n\"(St. Michaels Farmers Market) is in its 27th season and is the small town, producer-only farmers market of Maryland's Eastern Shore,\" said Market Manager Sandy Lawler. \"We are also the only market on the Eastern Shore that has a SNAP dollar for dollar matching program.\"\nLike Easton, the St. Michaels market has a wide array of bakers, farmers and artisans. Some of these include Little Fields Floral, Tilghman Island Baking, D&D Dog Treats, Scottish Highland Creamery, Chesapeake Mushrooms and Lyon Rum. There is also a weekly changing community and education tent and weekly musicians. Building African American Minds will be in the community and education tent on opening day.\nFor veggies, vendors include Shaky Wheelbarrow Herb Sales, Krieder's Tomatoes, Oksana's Produce Farm, Vintage Family Farm and Mindful Acres. Cottingham will have organic vegetables.\nNight Kitchen Coffee Roasters, Casa Carmen Wines, Willwaw Farm, Fat and Happy Farms and Agave Juice and Elysium Farm will all be offering their creations.\nLawler put her finger on why this market is so enduring.\n\"Farmers Markets are important for so many reasons,\" she said. \"... The biggest one is the support of our own community. Neighbor feeding neighbor with minimal transport, which means fresher healthier products including a lower environmental impact. Knowing your farmer means you are buying from someone who is a steward of the land.\"\nOpening day, the market will have Talbot County Public Schools students playing from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m., followed by WabiSabi to close.\nFor more information, call 410-713-0507. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Garden club hosts former White House floral designer\n\n April 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 566\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Over 100 smartly dressed ladies and gentlemen came together on Wednesday at the Talbot County Country Club to raise money for a college scholarship.The Garden Club of the Eastern Shore also brought flower ambassador and former Chief Floral Designer at the White House Laura Dowling to speak.\nTen tables bedecked in fine china, ranunculus, cherry blossoms and peonies portrayed different, colorful themes, including \"A Breath of Spring\", \"The Islands are Calling\" and \"Margaritaville.\"\nThe designers worked really hard to make it all look effortless. Event planners, floral designers, interior designers and boutique owners were some of the creative minds at work.\nOne of the organizers of the fundraiser, Barbie Calvert, said, \"My favorite part is seeing the finished product, helping all the designers with their tablescapes and seeing all the effort that the people have put in.\"\nAs this was a fundraiser, the garden club capped attendance at 100 tickets for $100 a piece. They sold out.\nAnd the fundraising went beyond the ticket price.\nSandy Kaufman, president of the Garden Club of the Eastern Shore, organized sign-up options called \"Eastern Shore Adventures\" that included mushroom foraging, an overnight stay at the Oaks Waterfront Hotel and flower designing with driftwood for 10 people. Instead of just a silent auction, she wanted there to be things to do, she said.\nWhen it was time to introduce Dowling, fundraising committee co-chair Leslie Ware said, \"There are two words to describe Laura. Humility and graciousness. The other word that kept coming up is passion. Passion led Laura to Paris to study with master designers learning the French technique of putting blooms and colors together.\"\nNot a single seat was open for her presentation. There was a palpable buzz. She wanted the assembled to think about why tablescapes are important.\n\"The art of the table is so important that there is a French philosopher who says that the most important moments of our lives are often gathered around a table. So what they are doing is not only beautiful but meaningful. The energy in the room, there is so much excitement and appreciation for beauty. I am just happy to be a part of that,\" Dowling said.\nThe presenter came with large television monitors to help tell her story of working in the White House. She gave tips and techniques but also a bit of presidential history and the ways each president and first lady entertained differently. While speaking, she created elegant bouquets for people to win in a silent auction.\n\"It is possible to start out as a part time florist working in my kitchen to becoming a White House Chief Floral Designer. I would say follow you passion and dream. As you go through life you build experience and gather skills,\" Dowling said.\nProceeds from the event go toward a $6,000 scholarship for a student going to college for agriculture or botany.\nThe scholarship went to Easton High senior and 4H member Autumn Rain Redman, who will be going to the University of Florida. She wrote that it was the \"best program to link sustainable agriculture with nutrition and how eating the best foods enhance health and athletic performance.\"\nRemaining funds raised will cover the costs of hosting the event. Any remaining funds will go toward next year's scholarship fund.\n\"Garden Club of the Eastern Shore is a small club making a big difference. It has an environmental focus, but also does so many things in the community,\" Kaufman said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

GOTTO Special to the Kent County News | Section: Life \n \n 564\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n There is a season— turn, turn, turn! That season is spring and with it comes the Chestertown Garden Club's premier annual garden sale, May Mart, to be held on Friday, May 3, starting at 9 a.m. in downtown's Memorial Park.May Mart is the sole fundraising event for the Club, according to member and May Mart Co-Chair, Penny Block, who noted that the members take nearly an entire year to plan and execute the annual initiative.\n\"We start planning for this event, as soon as [the current one] is over,\" said Block, of the \"all-hands-on-deck\" coordinated effort.\nWhat is created is a morning and early afternoon—the event is open until 1 p.m.—filled with the beauty, bouquet, and bounty from several local farms that raise and then donate the plants for sale at reasonable prices to the community.\n\"Eastern Shore Tents & Events provided all the tents, chairs, and tables …. and we have wonderful donations from several nurseries in the area including shrubs and small trees,\" said Block, for which they are so grateful.\nTideland Gardens of Chestertown, and Angelica Nurseries and Bonnie Plant Farm, both of Kennedyville, will be supplying the varieties of flowering perennials, some annuals, native plants, and a selection of herbs and vegetable plants for sale.\nPlants will be tagged with basic growing information and divided into groups according to shade, sun, partial sun, and drought-resistant categories.\nWhen asked if there was a strategic approach to shopping at the Mart, Block said, \"Head to the plant table first,\" because she said it will be easy to become distracted by the sights and smells of the event's other attractions.\nBlock was happy to announce that they will be working with Happy Chicken Bakery, Catering & Cafe for the first time this year and they will be offering a menu of tasty breakfast sandwiches starting at 8 a.m. You can also get your morning coffee at their stand and choose from a selection of items for the lunch hour. Additional beverages will also be available for purchase and event participants can even pre-order items at happychickenbakery.com prior to Mart morning.\nEvent-goers will also have the opportunity to purchase a treat from the Club's yummy Bake Sale table, and shop the \"All Things Garden\" section for a variety of new and gently used garden-themed items for sale. Raffle tickets can be purchased to support the cause, as well. Three tickets for $5 will be available and the winner will receive a $100 gift certificate that can be used at participating downtown Chestertown shops and restaurants. Mart shoppers will have the added convenience of paying via credit card this year.\nAlong with the time and attention the Club provides year-round to maintain and beautify Chestertown's Fountain and Memorial Parks, the members whose motto is \"Rooted in Community Service since 1931\", also seeks to inform and educate the public by way of on-going initiatives such as its recent innovation, the \"Good Seeds'' garden program. This community-centric collaboration of parents, teachers, students, local businesses, and the Town, recently worked together to provide new landscaping at Chestertown's H.H. Garnet Elementary School. This project also provided for the addition of a dedicated environmental learning space, which is already in full use by the school.\nThe day's festivities will proceed rain or shine, and since this is the season to turn, turn, turn, Block said the Club is hoping for only the best of turn-outs no matter the weather. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Strawberry season has arrived\n\n April 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1299\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Strawberries are arriving in stores, just-opening produce stands and at the fields on the farm.My mother grew several fields of strawberries, and we all picked them along with hired local pickers. Many places feature pick-your-own berries, and what fun this can be with your family.\nWatch this paper and other local media sources for the popular Strawberry Festival. I remember all those wooden strawberry crates filled with berries, loaded on the flatbed trailers being pulled by the tractor and taken to town and the auction block.\nThere were many other farmers there with berries as well. At the end of the day, each picker would be given tickets to indicate the number of quarts they picked and on the last day of working that week the tickets were redeemed for cash.\nA lot of men, women and children made money that way to pay their bills, buy food and survive. Mom would always save lots of berries for our family to make preserves, cakes, pies, cobblers and delicious strawberry ice cream.\nSTRAWBERRY CHICKEN SALAD\nIn a medium bowl place 2 cups fresh baby greens, 1 cup washed and sliced fresh strawberries, 1/2 to 3/4 cup mandarin oranges, 6-ounce precooked chicken breast (chilled and sliced), one tablespoon sliced toasted almonds, 1/2 to 3/4 ounce sliced red onions, and 4 ounces poppy seed dressing. Toss and serve. This will serve two, so double this for serving more.\nSTRAWBERRY COFFEE CAKE MUFFINS\n¼ cup unsalted butter (softened), ½ cup granulated sugar, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 2 teaspoons baking powder, pinch of salt, ½ cup buttermilk, 1½ cups all-purpose flour, 2 cups fresh strawberries (diced small). For the crumble: ½ cup all-purpose flour, ¼ cup butter (chilled and cubed), ¼ cup brown sugar, ¼ cup granulated sugar.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 12-cup standard muffin tin with paper liners or coat with nonstick spray. Set aside. To make crumble: In a medium bowl, combine granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour and chilled cubed butter. Stir with a fork or pastry blender until the mixture is crumbly. Set in the fridge until ready to use. To make muffins: In a large mixing bowl cream the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg, vanilla extract and buttermilk, beat until well combined. Sift in the flour, baking powder and pinch of salt, and beat on low speed until just mixed. Gently fold in about half of the strawberries. Fill muffin liners ¾ full with batter, top with remaining strawberries and then sprinkle crumble on the tops of the muffins. Bake for 18-20 minutes, until the muffins are lightly browned on top and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean\nSTRAWBERRY PIE\nMake and bake one 9-inch pie shell, let cool and set aside. Wash and cap a large carton of fresh strawberries and let dry. When the berries are dry, place small and medium sized berries in the pie shell. Start in the middle of the shell and work out to the edges, trying to fill the shell without leaving spaces. I slice berries to have a full shell. Any berries left over, place in a heavy saucepan where we will make the filling. In this heavy saucepan, combine 1 cup sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt, 3 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch with the leftover berries. Mash well with potato masher getting juices out — let juices stay in the mixture. Heat and stir at the same time until mixture begins to thicken. Take off the stove and stir in one teaspoon lemon juice. Stir and cool — pour over berries in a pie shell and spread evenly with a spoon. Top with whipped cream.\nSTRAWBERRY COBBLER\nBeat 1 egg and 1/2 cup milk together and add 2 cups flour, 3 teaspoons baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons sugar and 5 tablespoons shortening. Mix well and spread in a 9x13x2 inch pan and cover the bottom of the pan and sides of the pan. Pour two quarts washed, capped whole strawberries on top of the dough — if berries are too large then slice in half. Then beat 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla and pour on top of berries. Add 1 1/2 cups sugar on top of the mixture. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake at 375 degrees for 45 minutes or until done.\nSTRAWBERRY RHUBARB PIE\n1 cup + 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, 6 tablespoons cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 pound fresh rhubarb, 1 pund strawberries (stemmed and quartered), 1 tablespoon orange juice, 2 teaspoons orange zest, 2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, 1 large egg, 2 tablespoons turbinado sugar.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet on the center rack of the oven to preheat. Roll out 1 piece of dough on a floured surface into a 12-inch round, starting at the center and working your way out. (Sprinkle flour over the top of the dough if it's a bit too moist.) Carefully lift the dough and place in a 9-inch pie pan (not deep dish); gently press against the sides of the pan. Trim excess overhanging dough at the edge of the pie plate. Stir together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a large bowl until evenly combined. Add the rhubarb, strawberries, orange juice, orange zest, and vanilla. Toss until evenly coated. Pour the fruit mixture into the pie crust. Roll out the other piece of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface. Cut into eight 1 1/2-inch-wide strips. Arrange 4 strips of dough in parallel rows on top of the filling. Working with one strip at a time, arrange the remaining 4 strips perpendicular to the first ones, weaving the strips over and under to form a lattice. Trim the ends of the strips and press them against the bottom crust. Press with a fork all around the edge of the pie crust to crimp.\nIn a small bowl, whisk the egg and 1 tablespoon of water with a fork. Brush the dough lightly with the egg wash and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Bake the pie until the filling is bubbly and thickened in the middle of the pie, 1 hour 20 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. (Cover the pie with foil if the crust is getting too dark after 45 minutes.) Allow the pie to cool to room temperature before slicing, about 4 hours.\nSTRAWBERRY BREAD\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour two 9-inch loaf pans, set aside. Wash and cap and slice 2 quarts of fresh berries. Drain well and place in a medium bowl. Stir in 4 beaten eggs, 3 cups all purpose flour, 2 cups sugar, sugar, 3 teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 1/4 cups cooking oil, and 1 cup chopped nuts. Mix well and pour into prepared pans and bake one hour or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.\nSTRAWBERRY LEMONADE\n1 pound strawberries (plus more to garnish), 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, 2 cups fresh lemon juice (strained and divided), ice, lemon slices to garnish. Hull and quarter the strawberries. Place the strawberries in a large bowl, stir in the sugar and ¼ cup lemon juice. Allow to sit, covered for 30 minutes. In a countertop blender, blend the strawberry mixture until pureed. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve to get the seeds out. In a large bowl, combine the strawberry puree with the remaining 1 ¾ cups of lemon juice and 4 cups of water. Add up to 1 additional cup of water to taste if the mixture is too sweet or strong. To serve, stir the lemonade and pour it over ice. Garnish with sliced lemon and strawberries.\nEnjoy picking berries with family and friends. I will include more berry recipes before the season is over and we get closer to summer. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

GOTTO Special to the Kent County News | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1135\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n High Street between Queen Street and Spring Avenue along Chestertown's main thoroughfare is humming again on Saturdays with shoppers, strollers, and the sights and sounds of a crowd in the midst of an essential weekly ritual centered around sustenance.Open weekly from 8 a.m. to noon, that sustenance is just as much about the mind and spirit, as it is about the body. However, market goers—local residents and out-of-towners alike—seem to revel in an esprit de corp that happens when an established and enriched agricultural and artisan community bands together to feed the stomach—and the soul.\nThe farmers market is year-around put picks up more vendors and bigger crowds when the weather warms.\nMost, if not all, of the long list of vendors were back in full force now that the spring and summer version of the Chestertown Farmers' Market is back in town and from the sounds of vendors and participants alike, it is going to be another robust season of fresh fruits, hardy veggies, and all manner of creative arts and handmade crafts.\nTwo of those creative vendors, Tolchester resident Mary Faulkner of Falling Branch Jewelry, Oil Paintings, and Sculpture, and Beverly Miller of Beve's Creations enjoyed the warm sunshine and chatted with various 9 a.m.-hour market goers.\n\"I really like talking to the people who purchase what I do, the paintings and the jewelry,\" said Faulkner. \"It's a really nice community and this is a nice way to sell my work.\"\nMiller, who sells colorful handmade quilts from her vendor stand, said she also enjoys the sense of conviviality created at the market and the level of talent that can be found there, as she touted the technique that Faulkner used to create a mural on a wall in her home in Worton. Instances of camaraderie are common occurrences at the market, they said.\nA bit further down the artisans row, Mary Yirka of Chestertown and her dog, Eddie, displayed some beautiful and unique jewelry pieces and small-batch greeting cards for sale.\n\"Everyone is so friendly to Mr. Ed,\" Yirka said of her furry, neck-tied buddy who often attends the market with her.\nYirka described the art for sale at the market as diverse and one-of-a-kind.\n\"You see something different every weekend and you never get bored.\"\nWith just two weeks to go until one of the biggest event weekends in town, the Chestertown Tea Party Festival volunteer committee booth fielded questions of all sorts, ahead of the 250th anniversary of the festival which is set to take place starting on May 24 and running through the 26th.\n\"I was unaware that this was the 250th anniversary year of the festival. I'm so glad you're here like this,\" said a new market shopper, Yolanda Stuart of Rock Hall, of the committee volunteers tending the booth. Along with answering questions about parking, bringing pets, and what foods we might anticipate enjoying, the committee members were on hand at the market to create the buzz that will no doubt bring the visitors from far and wide.\n\"This Tea Party is actually larger than Boston's,\" said Committee Member-at-Large, Nina Fleegle, of the event, which she added was attended by 30,000 people last year.\nBeing a conduit of communication and a support system for the underlying greater community has become a function of the market, which has been a fixture on High Street since it was formally established in 1981. What started out as an outlet for organic produce has grown to attract vendors from across Maryland and beyond offering many different types of products.\n\"Chestertown has become one of our staples on the Eastern Shore,\" said Kari Parreco, who was tending the Gray Wolf Spirits stand.\n\"The people are so nice here and they tend to appreciate when something is handcrafted,\" she said of the spirits produced by their St. Michaels-based distillery.\nIn addition to spirits, fine local wine, chocolates, fresh pasta, fresh-cut flowers, pet treats, meats, dairy products, (even duck eggs) and artisanal breads from the market's newest vendor, Lucky Heart Bakery, are all available for purchase—and people are coming from all over to shop here.\n\"It's not uncommon, especially during this season to hear people say 'I'm here from Lancaster for the weekend', or 'I've come from Annapolis, D.C. or Pasadena',\" said Zach LeDoux of Happy Chicken Bakery and Catering.\nLeDoux, who co-owns the business with his wife, Martha, credited the market with helping grow their business from an enterprise that gleaned $100 per outing when they started out five years ago, to one that he says has grown \"exponentially.\"\nLike LeDoux, Melissa McGlynn of McGlynn's Cottage Pies said her business simply would not exist without the market, which turned out to be a godsend during COVID when her role as pastry chef at a local restaurant was cut and she needed to pivot.\n\"I just started thinking about what else I could do, and what the town wasn't already doing, and I thought pies, hearty, savory pies.\"\nThose hearty, savory pies are now market favorites, and are great for those who struggle with their schedules and meal-planning.\nAnd when it comes to meals, Chestertown Farmers' Market Manager, Julia Medrano, said she feels the market and its substantial offerings can be the place where you can easily shop for a week's worth of meals that are both healthy and sustaining.\nMedrano, who has been in her role since 2019, sees the market as a huge foundation for the community and its people.\nThe market, she said, has several things going for it: excellent word-of-mouth advertising, a beautiful location, and the bounty that comes from acres upon acres of local farms.\n\"Kent County is such an agricultural county and the Farmers' Market really caters to that. It really shows the public that this is where you can get your meals,\" Medrano said.\nThe market, she added, is also the place where people come to see people they know, so the socialization factor is huge.\nAnd the vendors are also your neighbors or someone you know, she explained, which is a great way to put money right back into the community; all contributing to what she sees as a bright future for the market.\n\"We moved to a non-profit, so we have a board now, and I'm looking forward to their ideas and their implementation … I hope it just continues to grow.\"\nAll tasty baked goods, bouquets, and boutique bourbon aside, it's clear that taking time to stroll High Street on Market Saturday reaps benefits beyond finding the perfect melon.\nIn fact, Saturday mornings at the market has become such an experience, that attendee Julie Armstrong, said her mother, Mary, requested it as her primary Mother's Day activity with her daughter. A graduate of Washington College, Armstrong, who now resides in Reisterstown, described her trip back to Chestertown's Market as 'nostalgic'.\n\"It's very poignant to be back,\" Armstrong said. \"This place has so much gravity to it; it's hard to stay away for too long.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Farm Bill faces cuts to critical food programs\n\n May 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ALBERT R. WYNN | Section: Columns \n \n 834\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After recently voting to keep the government funded, Congress is expected to turn to a laundry list of pressing legislative items. Among these are tackling the fiscal year 2025 appropriations bills and reauthorizing the Farm Bill, which is set to expire at the end of the fiscal year. The Farm Bill is an incredibly important law that invests in our farmers to keep rural communities growing, helps export more American agriculture products abroad and ensures food security for tens of millions of lower-income families.In the words of former President Obama, the Farm Bill is a \"Swiss army knife\" for the country, and it's time for Congress to put pen to paper and deliver.\nThe Farm Bill is normally an incredibly bipartisan endeavor and often passes with broad bipartisan support. This time, things are likely to be a bit different as some leading Republicans, including a Maryland congressman, are seeking to poison legislative progress by seeking spending cuts to critical programs and product restrictions that would leave millions of our neighbors worse off.\nAs the party of choice, dignity, and compassion, Democrats should continue to stand up to the other sides efforts to disrupt the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and funding for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). This is a dual-track threat: calling for pilot programs to \"test\" restriction in the appropriations process and potential amendments to enact restrictions in the Farm Bill.\nThis issue is as real as ever. In recent weeks, some Republicans have stood as a roadblock to expanding funding to WIC as leverage to score a pilot program on product restrictions within SNAP.\nIn my view, extreme Republicans are wrong to play politics with anti-hunger funding for mothers and their children. These are real people, and politicians should put them in the crossfire in order to win a personal policy priority. As the National WIC Association said recently, these efforts are \"unnecessary and harmful,\" and undermines the \"success of a program that has enjoyed decades of overwhelming bipartisan support.\"\nEssentially, the unrealistic demand is for a five-state pilot program to restrict retailers from accepting SNAP benefits for items that are not \"nutrient-dense\" foods. Their stated goal is to eliminate the ability for lower-income consumers to buy snacks, candy, and sodas and it also opens the question as to what it means to be \"nutrient-dense\" and how this program will be enforced in the real world. It could also add new burdens and headaches onto America's 248,000 retailers, the overwhelming majority of which are small businesses, if this pilot were to go nationwide.\nThankfully, when Republicans were attempting to stuff this bad idea into one of the most recent funding bills, Democrats held strong and stopped its inclusion. As Democratic leadership noted, this policy is \"extreme\" and the Republican proposal \"would have limited food choices for people on SNAP.\"\nNot only are these Republicans on the wrong side politically, but the policy position is also extreme. In addition to pushing a pilot program, there is also a misguided proposal floating around with an oft-named Healthy SNAP Act, a bill that would restrict consumer choice in the grocery store. Specifically, the proposal would prohibit recipients from purchasing certain food items such as soft beverages and snacks.\nWhile this legislation seeks to lower obesity rates, it fails to consider that Americans get their food from more than one aisle of the grocery store.\nThe truth is choices lead to better outcomes, and the private sector is on the front lines of lowering caloric intake in their products. Take a walk through the soft drink or snack aisle — consumers today have more options than ever, with diet, zero calorie and reduced sugar options. Consumers should be empowered to make the best decisions for themselves and their families when they are purchasing products they enjoy. Republicans claim to believe in limited government, but in this case, they want to have the government limit consumer choice.\nThe proposal also infringes on the dignity of SNAP recipients, many of whom are people of color. Recipients of SNAP know the importance of a balanced diet, and they don't need the government to make those decisions for them.\nWe all recognize that obesity in America is a real problem, but the solution for this complex issue won't be found by banning soda, snacks and other products from the SNAP program. As the former CEO of Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, noted in a recent piece, \"There's little reason to believe that the use of SNAP funds to purchase sodas would do much to reduce obesity at the population level. The Food and Drug Administration reports that, as of 2020, less than 6% of the typical diet is made up of sugar-sweetened beverages.\"\nAs negotiations on the Farm Bill progress, let's hope the Healthy SNAP Act and corresponding pilot programs are added to the shredder and not to the actual bill. Consumers and businesses would be better off with keeping the status quo.\nAlbert R.

That was not more apparent to Cawley than during this strawberry season, when hundreds of community members gathered in the rain to show the local farmer some support.Cawley said they had a perfect storm for a terrible season for their crop.\nIn a short window, his farm had a concentrated harvest of strawberries due to a condensed winter when too much fruit appeared all at once. Not enough people were picking strawberries at their \"U-Pick\" hours, so much of the strawberry crop was not generating profit.\nOn top of all that, there was a lot of rain. Cawley describes rain as \"kryptonite\" for strawberries.\nIn an attempt to generate more business, Cawley posted a video on social media asking for help and offering a buy one, get one free sale on the \"U-Pick\" strawberries. The next morning, people were waiting in the parking lot.\n\"We had strawberries everywhere that were red and ripe and needed to be picked, and it looked like we were going to lose all those strawberries to rain,\" Cawley said. \"We just reached out and asked for help telling people about the situation, and it was absolutely amazing how many people came out.\"\nCawley said the community showed up for him in the rain by the hundreds. Under large umbrellas and bright raincoats, people showed up with their families to help pick over an acre and a half of strawberries.\nNancy Minahan, owner of Caroline's, a restaurant near the farm, said she and her husband went out during the weekend to help Cawley's farm. Minahan said she was astonished by the amount of people who appeared to help. She was happy to see people showing up for local farmers.\n\"We just all need to support our local farmers as much as we can,\" Minahan said. \"People need to understand how hard they work and occasionally need help. We can't control the weather; we can't control a lot of things. And if there's anything we can do to help them, that's great.\"\nCawley said it was humbling to see the community step up and support his farm. He believes it is essential for small businesses to have faith and ask for help from the community when needed.\n\"Don't be afraid to step out in faith,\" Cawley said. \"It sounds corny, but honestly, when you let go, let God take care of it. It's amazing where you can go and what you can do and really how silly you are for worrying about things because you can't control anything. We can't control the weather. We can't control anything.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Appellate court upholds right-to-farm protection for Trappe farm\n\n June 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 646\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Last week, the Appellate Court of Maryland upheld a right-to-farm protection for Trappe's Foster Farm.The decision overruled a Talbot County Circuit Court decision and affirmed the original stance on the use of a soil conditioner taken by the Talbot County Agricultural Resolution Board in December 2022.\nThe Delmarva Chicken Association, along with the Maryland Farm Bureau and Maryland Grain Producers Association, applauded the decision.\n\"As Maryland's rural regions face increasing pressure from development, it's crucial to protect farmers' (rights) and to keep commonly accepted agricultural practices in their toolboxes,\" DCA Executive Director Holly Porter said in a press release. \"Even though this lawsuit did not directly involve a chicken grower, a loss in court would have been detrimental to every farmer and grower in the state.\"\nOriginal complaints were filed to the board in September 2021 by a number of neighbors and residents, many of whom claimed the farm emanated odors from a stockpiling of sludge-like materials sent to the farm by Denali Water Solutions.\nThe board heard resident and expert testimonies, and determined the Denali soil conditioner that included processed clams was responsible for the odor. Residents described feeling nauseous and dizzy, while others said their children could not play outside with the odor and its effects.\n\"There is no dispute that the strong smells coming from the farm were caused by the Denali soil conditioners that were both stockpiled and applied to the soil on the Foster farm,\" the Board wrote in 2022.\nDenali and the Foster Farm agreed to cease stockpiling and usage of the product that contained the processed clams at that location.\nThe circuit court reversed the original decision after determining the time between the placement of the soil conditioners and the submission of complaints was less than the one year that state and county code protects.\n\"The storage of industrial waste was never there before and should not have been protected by the right-to-farm act,\" said Cheryl Lewis, one of the appellees.\nWhile appellees argued that the farm's operations changed so much as to reset the one-year protection period, the appellate court said state code is ambiguous as to whether that period resets \"when an agricultural operation changes its methodology/approach.\"\n\"Based on the legislative history, non-negligent agricultural operations — those that are compliant with the necessary regulations and that have been under way for one year or more — are shielded from nuisance claims when expanding a nutrient management program,\" the appellate court's ruling read.\nCounty code \"demonstrates that agricultural land may change the modality of its operations without losing liability protection,\" Judge Glenn T. Harrell Jr. wrote.\nChoptank Riverkeeper Matt Pluta, who spoke at the original Board hearing in 2022, said the product was especially concerning in terms of pollution.\n\"They've got this huge pond on site right there that drains the local waterway,\" Pluta said. \"The stockpiling of the clam bellies occurred right next to the pond. It wasn't well contained. It was seen running off the storage site after rain events.\"\nAttorney Mark Cropper, who represents both Denali and farm operator Arthur Foster Jr., declined comment for this story.\nThe regulation of similar industrial waste and dissolved air flotation (DAF) residuals — a sludge-like material stemming from food plants that process wastewater — has been a hot button topic at both the county and state levels.\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, Caroline County Commissioners adopted four resolutions earlier this year to place moratoriums on the storage of DAF residuals, with the hope to buy more time for the county to consider regulations.\nLast month, Gov. Wes Moore signed a bill requiring anyone who wishes to use or store food processing residuals to obtain a permit from the Department of Agriculture.\n\"I think it brought to light a lot of the inadequacies we have here in Maryland for using this material,\" Pluta said of the Foster Farm case. \"I think we're going to see a different path forward with this new legislation.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The days were filled with numerous agriculture topics and allowed the students to have many hands-on experiences at learning stations lead by industry experts including aquaculture, grain, farm animals, food safety and pollination, he said,\nThis year in particular focused on the variety of career opportunities available within local agriculture, according to Page.\n\"Even if it's in ag, you might not be a farmer,\" said Jenell Eck McHenry of Thompson Ag Consulting Programs.\n\"Our whole premise of the day is to start to get students to really realize what is agriculture, how does it affect their lives, and so on,\" he said.\nAfter the two-day event, seventh-grade students penned essays to showcase what they discovered and answer the question, \"How did your experience change the way you view agriculture?\"\nThe Agricultural Awareness Committee reviewed the essays and selected the most impactful responses as winners.\nThe overall winner of the essay contest was Ellamae Athey of Centreville Middle School.\nFor Centreville Middle School, first place was awarded to Sara Klakring, second place was a tie between Teyauna Johnson and Wyatt Stephens and third place was a tie between Lucas Henderson and JP Tyler.\nFor Matapeake Middle School, first place was awarded to Delaney Grace Pugh, second place to Vivian Dorsey and third place to Jessica Lynn Busch.\nFor Stevensville Middle School, first place was presented to Conner Paterno.\nConstantly growing, this year's event saw over 100 volunteers dedicating their time and resources including animals to showcase ag awareness to the community seventh graders, said Lee Bridgman University of Maryland Extension Program Assistant Agriculture and Horticulture.\nThe partnership between the Queen Anne's County schools and the agricultural community continues to make an educating and exciting program and is already looking forward to next year, Page said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Ridgely farm uses miscanthus grass as innovative crop\n\n June 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 766\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY — Over a decade ago, Dave Tribbett had a hunch, and it centered around a 10-to-12-foot tall species of grass – giant miscanthus.Owner of Twin Maples Farms in Ridgely, Tribbett felt it could be used as alternative bedding in his poultry houses. The reception was ho-hum for the lesser-known crop.\n\"I couldn't talk anybody into planting this stuff,\" Tribbett said. \"Nobody knew anything about it.\"\nHe started by planting miscanthus on typically less successful areas, such as woodlines and ditches on his property. Once applied as chicken bedding, Tribbett noticed improvements to his chickens.\nTribbett has now planted hundreds of acres of the crop, working with industry leaders up and down the Eastern Shore to see its benefits. He works with Mountaire Farms to provide poultry farmers with the grass.\nMountaire communications director Catherine Bassett said \"it's a great alternative to wood shavings because fewer trees need to be cut down.\" Over half of farms that house Mountaire chickens use miscanthus bedding.\nThrough partnerships with Mountaire, U.S. Geological Survey, North Carolina-based AGGrowTech and the University of Maryland, among others, Tribbett feels miscanthus has been validated as a successful alternative for farmers. The USDA partners with Tribbett and industry leaders to test and assess the crop's benefits and risks on soil and the environment.\n\"I've accomplished my goal of proving it was a crop,\" he said. \"I've got the right people to check off this bucket list … and now it's building infrastructure to be able to process this crop, allowing other farmers to divert some of their farmland that's not as productive.\"\nTHE CROP\nA \"demanding crop,\" miscanthus grass is harvested in the winter and grows from spring to the fall before it frosts over. It is known as a perennial grass since it doesn't require replanting every year.\nWhile planting costs can be around $1,200 to $1,500 an acre, Tribbett says, the long-term savings for a farmer are significant.\nSarah Hirsh, an agriculture agent at the University of Maryland, is involved in miscanthus research. Giant miscanthus grass, which is the variety found on Tribbett's farm, isn't considered dangerously invasive, she said.\n\"Some varieties of miscanthus are invasive,\" Hirsh said. \"But the giant miscanthus, it's actually like a hybrid. … That makes it sterile like seedless watermelons. It can't reproduce by seed.\"\nThrough a Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education grant, Hirsh and the university worked with a Dorchester County farmer to plant the crop on 20 acres – a \"marginal\" farm, as Hirsh called it, compared to larger farmland such as Tribbett's.\nHirsh said while \"the field was salty, way beyond the levels that crops like corn or soybean would tolerate,\" the miscanthus grass withstood those conditions. The university collected yields of the crop for two years and an increase from 2.8 tons per acre to 4.8 tons.\nWorking with other local farmers is a goal for the Twin Maples owner, who hasn't been hesitant to \"open his books\" and share what's worked. Tribbett hopes cost-shares can help small farmers begin growing miscanthus.\n\"That's really the next kind of hurdle,\" Hirsh said. \" … How can we make this a viable crop in the context of these marginal fields?\"\nMISCANTHUS LEAVES\nNot long after Tribbett confirmed its viability as bedding for his chicken houses, he found the giant miscanthus could serve as a feedstock for Mid-Atlantic Organic Resource Company, Tribbett's compost business.\nOnce harvested, Tribbett has used miscanthus grass leaves in the company's compost, which also includes hatchery and grain waste. It's created a fertilizer that he applies to his own farm as well as selling to fellow farmers around the area.\n\"The result is an even-keel fertilizer that's not elevated in phosphorus levels,\" he said.\nTribbett emphasized the \"closed loop\" of business that this innovation has created, not just with his farm, but subcontractors on the Eastern Shore. The compost company currently employs 15 people, which could double to 30, as he works with AGGrowTech to create a bagging line for the crop by 2025.\n\"We are bringing work, we're bringing jobs and we're keeping it here on the Shore,\" Tribbett said. \" ... It'll be a good crop for Caroline County, the Shore (and) the state.\"\nPlus, it's created industry partnerships that seek to take advantage of the crop's help in filtering groundwater and reducing trucking emissions from typical bedding sources. Tribbett has worked with the Maryland Environmental Service and sat in meetings with the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\"It's building a lot of momentum to bring organizations that have not traditionally worked together,\" Tribbett said. \"I guess it's why it touches me so much. I'm proud of the chicken industry. I wouldn't be here without the people that have worked with me throughout the years.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But before she supported farmers in Southern Maryland, McQuilkin lived in the United Kingdom and worked in fashion design, manufacturing and promotion.\nAfter receiving a textile design diploma from the University of Applied Arts Vienna, she eventually became the women's wear marketing executive for the International Wool Secretariat, which was founded to promote the sale of wool on an international scale. Unknowingly, this was only the beginning of McQuilkin's path to the agriculture industry.\nMcQuilkin later moved to the United States, married and took a break from working. She did not start her long journey with SMADC until her friend, the executive director of the company at the time, asked if McQuilkin would put her marketing skills back to work.\n\"I swapped frocks for farms,\" the Mechanicsville resident said.\nSMADC was formed to administer the Tobacco Buyout in Southern Maryland that started in 2000 to support farmers finding different and feasible types of agriculture in the region as they transitioned away from growing tobacco.\nMcQuilkin started part-time on April 22, 2004, a date she remembers well because it was her birthday.\n\"It was my birthday, and I spent it in the back of a truck,\" she said. \"A farm truck of a very, very wonderful farmer, Brett Grohsgal of Even' Star Farm, and he was delivering heirloom tomatoes.\"\nGrohsgal was delivering these tomatoes to his high-end restaurant clients in Washington, D.C.\n\"My director at the time said, 'Well there's no better way to get started than to see how we sell our product and the work that goes into producing all the things that we take for granted,'\" McQuilkin said.\nShe said she did not know much about agriculture before she started the position, but her first day may have been exactly what she needed to jump in.\n\"It was a very humbling and formative experience, but it was going to give me a taste of what it takes to be a farmer,\" she said.\nMcQuilkin said she has spent the next 20 years trying to make it easier for local farmers to expand their businesses while also promoting these agriculture enterprises to the public. Farmers should not have to spend hours researching how to start something new, she said. They should be in their fields doing what they love.\n\"Being able to help people in that way has been enormously satisfying to me,\" she said.\nShelby Watson-Hampton, the current director of SMADC, said McQuilkin's work has been instrumental in the success of many rural small businesses. McQuilkin has assisted farmers with navigating regulations, developing marketing strategies and promoting their bounty, and this has made her a pillar of support for the local farming community, Watson-Hampton said.\n\"For the past two decades Susan McQuilkin has been an unwavering champion for Southern Maryland's farmers,\" Watson-Hampton said. \"In our office, she's also been a mentor beyond compare. Her grace under pressure, unwavering grit, and elegant poise have inspired and guided all of us who've had the privilege to work alongside her.\"\nMcQuilkin said her mantra for this business is one she personally follows, but also one that she tries to share with the frustrated farmers who are met with roadblocks.\n\"Don't tell me 'no,' tell me how,\" McQuilkin said. \"I want to know how we can get from A to B even if it isn't a straight line.\"\nShe said one of her most memorable projects was working with Clover Hill Dairy, an Amish-owned and operated cheese dairy in Mechanicsville.\nSMADC, with the help of Southern Maryland legislators, was able to help Clover Hill Dairy get approval for a nonstandard/off-the-grid power supply and successfully launch Southern Maryland's first manufacturer-grade cheese in 2014.\nSMADC worked closely with the dairy's board members to develop their standards of procedure and provide a communications conduit with the Maryland Department of Health, an effort that took four years.\n\"We tend to forget that it's the job that [farmers] do 24/7, 365 days a year without many breaks,\" she said.\nMcQuilkin said working in the agriculture industry has made her more appreciative of local farmers and now she has a huge amount of respect for them.\n\"[The farmers] have to be experts. If not experts, jack of all trades in everything they do,\" McQuilkin said. \"They have to be courageous. They have to be informed. They're pretty darn determined. … They're just intuitively clever and very creative.\"\nMcQuilkin's last official day in the office was June 28.\n\"Right now I want to take a deep breath and feel the tea leaves, as we say in the U.K., and then decide where I want to be,\" McQuilkin said. \"There's no question that what I've done for 20 years is a very visceral part of me, and it would be difficult to remove myself completely from it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Picking blueberries and peaches\n\n July 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: News \n \n 1226\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Living in a very rural area growing up, it seemed we planted, grew and raised almost everything we ate.Harvesting time was exhausting — so much involved in the process of farm-to-table and the side roads of canning and freezing.\nHowever, we did not produce blueberries or peaches. My mother's family, the McCabes, had blueberry farms, and the peach farms were down in southern Worcester County. Therefore, designated \"picking trips\" were scheduled.\nAnd of course, ice water jugs were packed along with a picnic basket full of sandwiches and treats. It always seemed to be the hottest days of summer, and we would wear our swimsuits under our clothes.\nOn the way back, Mom would stop by Mumford's Landing outside of Bishopville in the St. Martins Neck Road area. We loved going to this river — St. Martins River — to have fun.\nSometimes we would go crabbing there for fun and easily come home with a bushel (that is for another column). First, let's make some delicious blueberry and peach dishes.\nFor breakfast this morning, I had fresh blueberries in my cereal. Yesterday it was fresh blueberries with cottage cheese. Wash your fresh blueberries and freeze for the winter to enjoy. I remember a story my late sister-in-law, Mildred, told me. One extremely hot June day she took her son and daughter to the strawberry fields to pick berries to be made into jelly and to freeze them with sugar. After a hot day of picking, canning and freezing it was finally done. On Monday after work, she arrives home to find her children not feeling well and a stain of red on the freezer lid. Opening the lid, finding most of the berries eaten, resulted in NO more berries of any kind processed unless they were in the jam and jelly form !\nBLUEBERRY COBBLER\nWash 3 cups of blueberries and dry them with a paper towel. Combine 2/3 cup sugar with 2 tbsps tapioca. Add 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Boil for 1 minute. Add the blueberries to this mixture. In a 9 x 13-inch baking pan place the berry mixture. Prepare a topping by mixing together 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 1/2 tbsps sugar, 2 1/4 tsps baking powder, 3/4 tsp salt, and 4 1/2 tbsps shortening. Mix well and add some milk if needed. Drop spoons on top of berries in a baking dish. Bake at 400 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes.\nBLUEBERRY PANCAKES\n1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 3/4 tsp salt, 1 1/2 tsps baking powder, 3/4 tsp baking soda, 1 tbsp granulated sugar, 2 1/4 cups buttermilk, 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract, 4 tbsps melted butter (plus more for serving), 2 large eggs, 2 cups fresh blueberries (plus more for serving), your favorite brand of maple syrup.\nIn a small bowl, mix flour, salt, baking powder and soda, and sugar together with a fork. In a large mixing bowl, combine buttermilk, vanilla, butter and eggs until well-mixed. Fold in dry ingredients and blueberries until just incorporated. Do not over-mix. Heat griddle or large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add dab of butter and scoop 1/3 cup of batter on griddle. Cook for 2 minutes then flip and cook 1 minute more. Pancakes should be golden brown. Repeat steps for remaining pancakes. Serve with butter, maple syrup and blueberries.\nBLUEBERRY CRUNCH\nCrumble together 2 sticks of butter with 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 cup self-rising flour and 1/2 cup pecans. Put this mixture in a long baking dish. Do not press down. Brown in a 350-degree oven for 6 minutes. While baking, mix together 1/2 cup sugar and 1 small container whipped cream. Pour on top of the cooled crust. In a bowl, mix together 8 oz soft cream cheese, 2 tsps milk and 1 can blueberry pie filling. Add this mixture on top. Sprinkle some fresh blueberries on top. Keep refrigerated after serving.\nBLUEBERRY COFFEE CAKE\nMix one box of yellow cake mix according to directions on the box, but use a little less water, leaving the mixture slightly thick. Pour this onto a greased cookie sheet that has sides. Sprinkle 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries over the top of the mixture. If you want to add a cream cheese filling, squirt or drop teaspoonfuls onto the top in many small spots. I use whipped cream cheese, which is easy to drop. Now make a crumb topping consisting of 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar and 2 tsps cinnamon. Mix and sprinkle over the top. Bake at 325 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes. Slightly cool before cutting.\nBLUEBERRY BUCKLE\nToday I am featuring the late Mrs. Doris Morean's recipe. Mrs Morean was a Federalsburg resident and quite a good cook, I was told.\nCream 1/2 cup shortening with 1/2 cup white sugar. Add one beaten egg and mix well. In another bowl, combine 2 cups flour, 2 1/2 tsps baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. Add this mixture to the creamed mixture alternately with 1/2 cup milk. Pour into a 11-by-7.5-by-.5-inch baking dish. Sprinkle 2 cups of fresh berries on top. Combine 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup flour, cinnamon and butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over the berries and bake at 350 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes.\nCRISPY PEACHES\nPlace fresh peeled and sliced peaches in the bottom of several custard cups. Top each cup with a mixture consisting of 2 beaten eggs, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 2 tbsps softened margarine and 2 cups breadcrumbs. Mix well and spread evenly over the top of each custard cup and bake at 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. You can use a small casserole dish or small pie plate.\nPEACH PIE\nPrepare and bake a 9-inch pie shell or purchase a 9-inch pie shell ready to fill. Combine 1 cup sugar with 3 tbsps cornstarch and a dash of salt in a medium saucepan. Stir in 1/2 cup water and 3 peaches that have been peeled and mashed. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes or until mixture is smooth and thickened. Cool. In the pre-baked pie shell, place 4 peaches, peeled and sliced, making the slices really thin. Pour the cooled peach mixture over the fresh peaches in the pastry shell and chill at least 2 hours before serving with whipped cream.\nPEACH COBBLER\nPeel and slice enough fresh peaches to equal 4 cups. In a 2-quart baking dish, melt enough butter to equal 1/2 cup. Mix 3/4 cup flour, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp baking powder and 3/4 cup milk. Place batter in a baking dish, then peach slices over the batter. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes.\nFRESH PEACH ICE CREAM\nPeel enough fresh peaches to equal 4 cups and chop into pieces. Place 2 cups of the chopped peaches in a blender with 1 cup whole white milk and 1/2 cup sugar and blend well. In a mixing bowl, beat 2 cups heavy whipping cream on high speed with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Add two 14-oz cans of sweetened condensed milk and continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Using a spoon stir in 1 qt half and half, the peach puree, 2 cups chopped peaches and 1 tbsp vanilla. Pour the ice cream mixture into a 4-to-6-qt canister of the ice cream freezer. Add milk if necessary to fill the canister to the freezer line. Freeze according to the ice cream freezer directions. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Each day of the fair, there are livestock shows open to the public.\nThe Phillips Wharf Environmental Center's Fishmobile will also be at the fair all three days. It has tanks with animals that live in and around the Chesapeake Bay.\nAdditionally, the fair and Ag Center will have dinners prepared by different local organizations each night. On Thursday, there will be a pork barbecue dinner by the Talbot County Young Farmers; on Friday, there will be a pork barbecue dinner by the Talbot County 4-H shooting sports program; and on Saturday, there will be a chicken barbecue dinner by Easton High School FFA.\nClougherty sees the fair as a way for county residents to support local organizations and youth while having a fun time.\n\"I love hearing about people who say we're not going to miss it,\" Clougherty said.\nThe fair's full schedule can be found at talbotcountyfair.org/schedule. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County Ag Center turns 60\n\n July 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 522\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On July 23, 1964, Donald Spies, Thomas Meredith and John Mulder signed on as founders of the Talbot County Agriculture & Education Center on Hiners Lane.With decades of 4-H showcases and county fairs under its belt, the Agriculture and Education Center is turning 60.\nIn partnership with member organizations Easton FFA, Easton Lions Club, Talbot County 4-H, Talbot County Farm Bureau, and Tri-County Ruritan, the Ag Center aims to strengthen rural Talbot County culture and provide agricultural education experiences.\nAmanda Clougherty, president of the Ag Center, says it's a team effort to prepare for large events like the fair.\n\"What makes us unique here is we are independently-owned,\" Clougherty said. \"We are a nonprofit organization. All of our neighboring county fair facilities are all owned by county governments. So we have a lot of things to worry about. We have to worry about facility maintenance, repairs, operations.\"\nAs co-chair of Ag Center's fair committee, Clougherty says that the fair has maintained that unique distinction.\n\"We know who we are,\" she said. \"We're a small, old-time, family-fun outing.\"\nWhile the center is hosting its 41st county fair this week, it serves the community year-round, not just during fair weekend. It hosts events such as weddings, birthday parties, meetings and workshops.\nWith no full-time paid staff members, the Ag Center relies on volunteers through community organizations. It makes for a truly unique and personable experience during any event, Clougherty said.\n\"It's a labor of love and service,\" she said.\nNEW PARTNERSHIPSClougherty says the Ag Center is always open to new relationships throughout the county. For instance, the Rotary Club of Easton recently held its first event at the center to initiate new officers.\nAnother new partnership is coming this fall, as four soccer fields at the property will house Chapel District Sports' first year of soccer practices and games while Chapel District Elementary School is under construction.\n\"I just think it's a really good way to expose people to what we do here and build that community connectedness,\" Clougherty said.\nShe believes that partnership and similar ones will allow \"kids and families to come together.\" She also mentioned an \"ag-accurate book trail\" will be on the grounds of the center by this fall, which will feature readings and activities at multiple stations.\nIMPROVEMENTSAs the Ag Center grows in its community reach, so has the need for facility improvements. Clougherty pinpointed recent upgrades, including up-to-date electric and a new sound system.\nFacility improvements would be completely different without assistance from Maryland 4-H youth, Clougherty said. Through Maryland 4-H's Diamond Clover Award Program, which requires service hours, local youth have transformed the Ag Center.\nShe said 4-H members have been responsible for rebuilding the outdoor stage, barns, installing fans in the buildings and making benches and the sidewalk accessible.\n\"We wouldn't be as far as we are today if it hadn't been for several outstanding youth throughout the years,\" Clougherty said.\nIt's just one example of how the community gives back to the Ag Center that has long served county residents, particularly youth.\n\"It's a special gold star for the kids who see the need and work hard to contribute,\" Clougherty said. \"Because they know they've benefitted from being out here.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lack of rain forces farmers to claim insurance\n\n July 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 604\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TUNIS MILLS — As veteran farmer Mike Mielke watched a young buck bound out of his very dry corn field on Marengo Road, he shouted, \"take it all. It is the insurance company's now.\"Due to lack of rain, his 1,400 acres are \"fired up from the bottom.\" The feet of the feed corn stalks are yellow, and the leaves are trying to preserve moisture by rolling up.\nMielke thinks a lot of Delmarva farmers are in the same predicament — super low bushel-per-acre yields due to lack of rain.\n\"This spot where we are has had about half an inch of rain over the last six weeks,\" he said. \"A lot of my other corn has had two to three inches total for that period, but that is nowhere (near) enough to grow a good crop and is already at or below the insurance coverage.\"\nFollowing the passage of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reauthorization Act of 1994, farmers are required to have crop insurance. They can get coverage for up to 85% of their average yield and must have coverage for a minimum of 50%.\nMielke got 80% coverage, and though he won't make any money off of this crop, the insurance money, he said, will cover him.\nFor Mielke, his insurance guarantees him 130 bushels per acre at $4.66. This does not cover all his expenses and land rent. It makes it a smaller loss.\n\"Yesterday was the first time I got out my insurance papers and started looking at these numbers. After 50 years of farming, you just have a sense of where your corn is,\" he said. \"The yield has been reduced by this drought.\"\nKim James, who sells crop insurance for Schauber-Van Schaik in Easton said early claims are already filing in from Talbot County farmers.\nThough there is still time for actual payouts to occur, she has seen about a dozen claims so far. In a normal, rainy season there are no claims, she said.\nJames said farmers have a 72-hour window to make a claim after seeing damage to their crop. To be safe, she said, many will make claims that can be withdrawn later if the crop improves.\n\"They put the claim in if they notice there is some damage. At this point, we don't have anybody that is destroying fields of corn. Most of them have the intention to take their grain to harvest,\" James said. \"We have had 10 or 12 in the general Talbot County area that are starting early claims. We are all praying for rain. Corn is pretty hurt in this area.\"\nShannon Dill, principal agent at the University of Maryland College of University of Maryland College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, said \"it has been a long time since it has been this dry. We have had droughts in the past, but it is extremely dry. Corn has one opportunity to make an ear. Once that opportunity is missed, like in a drought, it can affect the formation of the ear and the kernels. Therefore it really does cause problems with yield. We are definitely struggling with the corn crop.\"\nWhile Mielke said his business will survive, he expressed concern for younger farmers with a lot of debt, for whom, he said, the hot and dry conditions will be more difficult to weather.\n\"For farmers, you don't want to have a really bad year. That is the whole idea (of crop insurance), to avoid a devastating year,\" Mielke said. \"There is going to be some pain around here, especially for the younger ones who are highly leveraged. This is some of the worst we have seen for corn.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The combination of a beautiful setting and sense of community make the event at this location so special.Robin Bartenfelder from Preston has been selling produce at farmers markets for 47 years. Bartenfelder loves the scenery and the pleasant people that pass through the market each week.\n\"You have people coming in on the sailboats and everything, and the local people,\" Bartenfelder said.\nThe market attracts people from across the region and far beyond due to it being beside the Cambridge Yacht Basin.\nThe location also gives this particular market a rare opportunity to bring in customers who are traveling by water. Patrons can dock their boat and stop by the market for fresh produce before returning to their boats.\nMolly Ralph from Pittsville has only been selling her coffee sourced from farm-to-consumer companies at the market for a few weeks. \"You can't beat being next to the water. It's beautiful and breezy and everybody does just a great job with their booths here,\" Ralph said.\nThe Cambridge Farmers Market provides an opportunity for farmers and business owners to sell their homemade items, allowing the money to stay in the community rather than going to big corporations.\n\"I think it's really important for everybody to kind of know what's going on around them and realize that you can get the same kind of products that you're buying in the store locally and homemade and grown which is even more special,\" said Kaitlyn Milligan from Easton, selling Agave juices.\nThe weekly waterfront Cambridge Farmers Market runs from May through October and is open every Thursday from 3 to 6 p.m. at Long Wharf, High and Water Streets in Cambridge. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hundreds of residents came together to experience the various activities put together by organizers, volunteers and sponsors.The five-day celebration included events such as fashion shows, games, bouncy castles and vendors. Many of these events were hosted for young people with an interest in leadership, community service, arts and agriculture.\nThe opening ceremony was held on Thursday evening, kids held flags at the center of the Main Show Ring, Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) presented a citation of recognition to organizers of the fair and John Coleman, officer from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, sang \"God Bless America.\"\nLinda Brown, host of the opening ceremony, said in the past, Talbot County had to share its fair with other counties because of how small the county was. Today, Brown is proud of the work that the community does to make the fair possible.\n\"The big thing about this fair is that our community comes together,\" Brown said. \"(I) couldn't count the volunteers that come and do their piece. It could be shavings in a cow barn so that we can have animals. It could be taking a leaf blower and blowing the leaves out of our pavilion. Everybody just jumps in and works together to put on this amazing fair.\"\nBrown said she is proud of the work done by children and young people across the county, which was on full display at the fair.\nThis included the work of her granddaughter Annette Clougherty, who brought three of her cows for show this year.\nClougherty, 12, said she has deep love for animals and hopes to one day become a veterinarian. Her cows, Reba, Andy and Dolly huddled near a giant fan to cool off from the hot weather.\nClougherty encourages any kid who has an interest in animals to raise the animal of their choice and bring them to a local fair.\n\"Do your research, learn and don't just chase your dreams so you can get the money and be done with it,\" she said. \"Actually get into it because these guys (her cows), I don't ever imagine them going to the market, they're always mine in my heart.\"\nClougherty is proud to announce that she is taking her cows to Queen Anne's Fair, which is a big step for her family.\nIn a different stall, Bailei Caldeira, a young pig farmer, brushed her two pigs before a showing. It is her second year showing her pigs, and she said she is better prepared to make an impression. Caldeira said she has always loved pigs.\nWhen asked what advice she would give to kids who would like to raise pigs, she said working hard is the key to caring for pigs.\n\"Don't be scared, just do it,\" Caldeira said. \"Don't care about anyone else. Just care about your pig and you.\"\nFollowing the animal showing, dozens of kids from all age groups showcased their self-created outfits during the Talbot County 4-H Fashion Show.\nThe 4-H program is a local club teaching kids new skills, such as sewing, photography and more. Each kid had a moment to shine as dozens of parents took photos and cheered for their stylish outfits.\nBrown, a former home economics teacher, said she was so proud of all the work that the young contestant did for this year's show. For her, as host of the fashion show, she is impressed by the 27 outfits being modeled in the show and the work of the volunteers who make the event possible.\n\"It's just a culmination of hundreds of people working together and everybody doing their part in order to come up with this little event,\" Brown said. \"We are not a big state fair. We don't have squeaky rides and all that. We're not big enough, but we have people in the community that just come out and enjoy, socialize, marvel at what the kids are doing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "The garden, the basket and the stand\n\n July 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1120\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Our mother always loved planting a garden each year. Her last one was in the spring of 1997.It was a part of her life, and she excelled at all phases of the country garden, from planting, to hoeing, to picking and processing the vegetables.\nMom was busy planting her large garden before school let out, and I can swear that by the time the school bus door shut for the summer, it was time to start hoeing and picking.\nEach year, the baskets used to put the picked vegetables in to bring up to the water hose area to rinse down had to be brought out and cleaned. We had a small trailer hooked to the tractor to carry the supplies down and fresh veggies back.\nThat was always a comical act, as we pushed and shoved each other out of the way to get to drive first.\nThose baskets were used for many years and came from the basket-making factory in the next small town. We had two sizes — one was the small basket perfect for tomatoes, peppers, squash and other small vegetables. Then we had the bushel basket that was great for large stuff, like sweet potatoes, beets, potatoes and more.\nNow, the stand. I know you want to know just what a \"stand\" is.\nOur family never had a produce stand, as we used most of our garden vegetables. When we would have an excessive amount of vegetables, they were shared with other family members and the older folks who could no longer garden due to health.\nNothing went to waste on the farm — it was shared and given away.\nThe stands back in the day were on back country roads in front of farmhouses or in our small town in front of the post office or the gas station.\nThe kids would get excited when a car pulled up. You can bet the veggies were pulled fresh each morning.\nToday the roadside stands are like small stores, selling everything from sweet smelling soaps to fancy lunch linens and \"homemade\" jams, jellies and relishes. I still love the old family stands with grandma's veggies and the youngsters getting excited to get a customer.\nLets prepare some of these great farm-fresh foods with garden produce.\nBISHOPVILLE FRIED GREEN TOMATOES\n4 large green or slightly under-ripe tomatoes, 1/4 cup fine dry unseasoned bread crumbs, 1/2 cup flour, 1 tsp seasoning salt, 1/2 tsp ground black pepper, 1/4 tsp thyme leaves, 1/8 tsp ground red pepper, 1 egg beaten with 1 tbsp water, butter.\nWash tomatoes and remove stems. Cut each tomato in three thick slices. Combine bread crumbs with the next five ingredients. Mix well. Dip tomato slices in egg mixture, then roll in crumb mixture. Sauté in melted butter over medium heat, turning once to lightly brown both sides. Serve hot. Makes 12 slices.\nTOMATO PIE\nPastry dough for single crust 9-inch pie (a package of pre-made dough works well), 6 ripe tomatoes (peeled and cut in 1/2 inch thick slices), 1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar, salt and pepper to taste, pinch ground mace, 1 cup dried bread crumbs, 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice, 1/4 cup butter, 1 egg beaten with 1 tbsp water.\nPrepare pastry dough, wrap and chill (or leave pre-made packages in the refrigerator). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan. Make a layer of tomato slices in pan and sprinkle with some of the sugar, salt, pepper, mace and bread crumbs. Continue making layers as described, ending with bread crumbs. Sprinkle on lemon juice and dot with butter. Roll out pastry dough (or remove 1 piece from the package), transfer to pan and flute edges. Brush the top with egg-water mixture. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until nicely browned. Serves 6 to 8.\nHONEY BAKED SQUASH\n2 medium squash (about 1 pound each), 1/4 cup honey, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1/4 tsp allspice.\nCut each squash in half lengthwise; discard seeds and membrane. Combine honey, lemon juice, and allspice. Spoon into squash shells. Place squash in an 11-by-7-inch baking dish. Cover dish and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 10 minutes, basting occasionally with the honey mixture. Uncover the dish and bake for an additional 5 minutes or until squash is tender.\nSTUFFED PEPPERS\n1lb ground beef, 6 medium bell peppers (can use any color of peppers), 2 tsps garlic powder, 1 can French-fried onions, 1 can tomato soup with an added 1 1/2 tablespoons italian seasoning, 1 1/2 cups cooked rice, 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese.\nHeat oven to 375 degrees. Grease a 2-quart baking dish. Slice tops off of peppers and remove seeds and membranes. Blanch peppers in boiling water if desired. Set peppers in a prepared dish. Cook beef and garlic powder until beef is browned. Drain. In a medium bowl, stir together half of the French onions. Add rest of ingredients, mix well. Evenly spoon mixture into peppers. Cover with foil. Bake for 20 minutes or until the peppers are tender and the filling is hot. Remove cover; top with remaining onions and bake for 10 minutes more.\nZUCCHINI AND YELLOW SQUASH CASSEROLE\n1 tbsp coconut oil or olive oil, 1 large onion (sliced), 3 tomatoes (sliced), 2 yellow squash (sliced), 2 zucchini (sliced), ¼ cup panko bread crumbs, ¼ cup parmesan cheese, 1 tsp of Ms Dash seasoning or thyme, 2 cloves garlic, salt and pepper to taste.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease the bottom of a 13-by-9-inch glass baking dish with the coconut or olive oil. Place the sliced onion on the bottom of the dish. Layer the zucchini, yellow squash and tomato in 3 rows. In a separate bowl, combine in other ingredients. Sprinkle the panko mixture over top of the veggies. Bake for 30 minutes.\nSUMMER SWEET CORN SKILLET\n4 tbsps butter, 4 ears sweet corn (kernels sliced from cobs), 3 green onions (chopped), 2 cloves garlic (pressed or minced), salt and pepper, 8 medium-sized basil leaves (chopped).\nAdd butter to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once melted, add sweet corn kernels, green onions and garlic, then season with lots of salt and pepper and saute until kernels are crisp-tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add chopped basil then stir to combine and serve.\nThis last one has been a staple lunch for as long as I can remember.\nTOMATO MAYO PEPPER ON WHITE BREAD\n1 good ripe tomato that is getting soft but not spoiling, your favorite mayo (I prefer Helmans) and Schmidt white sandwich bread (or your favorite bread).\nSlice the tomato in thick slices, then set aside. Take your bread and slather the mayo on two pieces. I like to sprinkle the pepper right onto the mayo so it sticks. Then add your slices and go to town. A great summer snack to get you through until supper time. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Corn fields, corn cribs and corn recipes\n\n July 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1351\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Riding the country roads throughout the Eastern Shore brings back so many memories of the past.The cornfields of today have not changed — the beautiful green rows of corn stalks slightly moving in the hot breeze. But how these fields were planted and will be harvested has changed.\nThose modern, expensive, air-conditioned tractors with radios make life easier on 90-to-100-degree days. But the farmer's workday is still not easy — exposed to all kinds of environments, no guarantee of a successful harvest, seeds and chemical prices skyrocketing, getting farm workers is almost impossible. Yet that farmer keeps going and praying he has a good crop this year.\nAs we turn onto West Line Road, some of the corn fields are there — not many, but still a few. The memories begin to surface as I see where the barn once stood.\nThis barn housed the cows, and the second floor, known as the hayloft, held the hay. Many funny stories linger in that memory (another column for another day).\nBehind the barn were the hog pens, where a lot of the corn was eaten, and the corn stalks made clean bedding.\nThe corn crib is a slender shed and had a roof, wooden floor, latched door and slatted walls that allowed air and light to help keep the corn from molding. The corn in here had some husks on them, but by fall they had dried. We would peel off the dried husks and throw them onto the ground in the pig pen, then hand shelled the corn into the hog trough.\nIn those days, the older kids watched the younger kids when the parents had to attend events without their children. One day my parents left my older sister to watch us.\nMy sister was an \"undercover smoker.\" We were not allowed to smoke, but she did whenever and wherever no adults were around.\nAs soon as the car pulled out of the driveway, she got her \"smokes\" out and went outside, taking my brother with her, and they proceeded to \"puff.\"\nSuddenly my parents' car pulled in the driveway. Apparently, they had forgotten something.\nWell, my brother and sister shoved their lit cigarettes in the slats of the corn crib, which sparked a fire, and smoke soon billowed. My mom came out of the house, smelled smoke, ran in her \"dress clothes\" to get the water turned on for the hose while screaming for my dad to get out and help.\nMy brother never smoked again, but my sister smoked \"undercover\" for many more years.\nA few tips for buying corn at your local produce stands this year:\nDon't buy pre-shucked corn, as it starts getting starchy once the stalk is off.Examine the silk. Older corn silk will look brown/black and dried out. Fresh corn on the cob will have silk that's a lighter color.Look for husks that are bright green, and avoid husks that are brown, bruised or dried-out looking.Hold each ear of corn to find the heavier ones, which are juicier.\nEnjoy today's corn recipes.\nSTEAMED CORN6 ears corn (husked), 2 tbsps granulated sugar, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tsp salt.\nFill a pot full of water and bring it to boil. Stir in the sugar, lemon juice, and salt. Place the corn into the boiling water. Let the water return to a boil. Once boiling again, cover with a lid and turn off the heat. Cook the corn for 8-10 minutes or until tender.\nSWEET CORN RELISH10 fresh ears of sweet yellow corn (husks and silk removed, slice kernels off the cob with a sharp knife), 2 large red bell peppers (cored and finely chopped), 2 large green bell peppers (cored and finely chopped), 8 ribs celery (finely chopped), 1 large yellow or sweet onion (finely chopped), 4 cups apple cider vinegar, 2 cups sugar, 1 tbsp ground mustard, 3 tsps salt.\nCombine all the ingredients in a pot and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Ladle the relish into hot sterilized jars and seal with lids. Process the jars in a water bath for 10 minutes. Keep stored in a dark, cool place. Will keep at least one year. Once opened, store in the fridge for up to two months. Makes approximately 8 pints. Wait a week or two before eating the relish to allow time for the vinegar to mellow out. Use it on hamburgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, fish, serve it with roasted chicken or mix with tomatoes/onions/cilantro for a Summer salad.\nCORN PUDDING RECIPE5 large eggs, ⅓ cup butter (melted and slightly cooled), ¼ cup white sugar, ½ cup milk, ¼ cup cornstarch,1 ½ cups steamed or cooked corn or 1 can of kernel corn, 2 (14.75 ounce) cans cream-style corn.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a 2-quart casserole dish. Whisk eggs lightly in a large bowl. Add milk, melted butter, sugar, and cornstarch; whisk until well combined. Stir in drained corn and cream-style corn until fully blended. Pour mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour.\nCORN FRITTERS3 cups oil for frying, 1 cup sifted all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking powder, ½ tsp salt, ¼ tsp white sugar, 1 large egg (lightly beaten), ½ cup milk, 1 tbsp shortening (melted), 1 12-ounce can whole kernel corn (drained).\nHeat oil in a heavy pot or deep fryer to 365 degrees. Combine flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a medium bowl. Beat egg, milk and melted shortening together in a small bowl. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture. Stir in corn. Working in batches, drop fritter batter by spoonful into the hot oil. Fry until golden. Remove fritters with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.\nBARBECUE GRILLED \"CORN RIBS\"BBQ Seasoning Blend: 2 tbsps chili powder, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp packed light brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, salt.\nBBQ Sauce: 1 cup ketchup, 1 cup apple cider vinegar,1 /4 cup yellow mustard, 3 tbsps packed light brown sugar, 1/2 tsp hot sauce, salt.\nCorn Ribs: 4 ears corn (shucked), Canola or vegetable oil (for the grill grates), 1 scallion (thinly sliced).\nFor the BBQ seasoning blend: Stir to combine the chili powder, smoked paprika, brown sugar, cayenne pepper and 1 tsp salt in a small bowl.\nFor the BBQ sauce: Whisk together the ketchup, apple cider vinegar, mustard, brown sugar, hot sauce, 1 tsp salt and 1 tbsp of the BBQ seasoning blend in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the sauce has reduced and thickened, 10 to 12 minutes.\nFor the corn ribs: Using a large chef's knife and a large steady cutting board, cut off the ends of the corn cobs to make them flat. Using your hands, break the cobs in half crosswise. Stand a cob on one flat end and carefully and slowly cut down through the core, rocking the knife back and forth if necessary, to split the cob in half lengthwise. Repeat with all the cobs. Lay a split corn cob on its flat side on the cutting board and cut lengthwise through the cob, pressing down and rocking the knife back and forth if necessary, to make 2 long corn ribs. Repeat with the remaining cob halves. (You should have 32 ribs total.) Place on a rimmed baking sheet and set aside.\nPrepare a grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grates. Sprinkle the corn ribs with 1 tablespoon of the seasoning blend. Brush the ribs with 1/2 cup BBQ sauce. Place the corn, cut-side down, on the grill and close the lid. Cook until the cut edges are beginning to char and caramelize, about 8 minutes. Flip the ribs to the second cut side, close the grill lid and cook until the edges are caramelized and the corn kernels are crisp-tender, another 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the corn to a platter. Brush with more sauce and season with a pinch of the BBQ seasoning blend (reserve the remaining blend for another use). Sprinkle the scallions and serve with the remaining BBQ sauce. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Visitors can also discover creative local arts and crafts, and artisanal beverages from wineries, distilleries and breweries.\nThere will also be local food trucks, a hospitality tent, live entertainment by Chaptico Songworks, an oyster tasting experience, door prizes, carriage rides with the Suttler Post Farm Clydesdales, pony rides, a petting farm and face painting.\nAdmission is $5 for ages 7 and older and includes an ice-filled insulated tote bag.\n\"We have found over the years on our own farm that there is a growing interest in our community of local consumers to not only have locally produced agricultural food products,\" Wood said, \"but to get to know the farmers that grow them. The Buy Local week is a really good time to make that happen.\"\nFor more information on the Buy Local Challenge or to purchase tickets for the celebration event, go to buylocalchallenge.com.\nTwitter: @MichaelSoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Best in show: 4-H kids work hard to raise, ready animals for fair\n\n July 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lilly Howard Special to the Whig | Section: News \n \n 747\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FAIR HILL — In the months leading up to the Cecil County Fair, 4-H members can be found working hard, raising and training their animals to get them ready for the fair.At the fair, the animals are one of the main attractions, housed in the fairgrounds' barns in between the various competitions and showings that take place throughout fair week.\nTails and Trails 4-H club worked together this year to try something new: raising and showing 100 meat chickens.\n\"They eat and drink a whole lot more than you would ever imagine at this point. We bought a bag of feed yesterday and we are almost out of it,\" 4-H member Katilyn Carter said.\nCarter, 16, is showing meat goats, meat chickens, and doing herdsmen with her pony. Herdsmen entails keeping your animal at the fair all week, ensuring they are fed, watered, healthy and clean, with a corresponding informational board to educate the public and judges about your animal.\nTo prepare her meat chickens, Carter washes them two to three days before the show to ensure they have a natural oily shine. This paid off, as her chickens won first and second place ribbons at the fair over the weekend.\n\"It's going to sound really funny, but you actually blow dry them. You want them to be really fluffy…You just want them to look like little chunk balls of fluff and meat,\" said Carter about preparing her chickens for show day.\nIn showmanship competitions, you must be very knowledgeable about your animal in order to show the judges that you put in the work to be successful, according to Carter. The 4-H member must present their animal to the best of their ability, demonstrating cleanliness and knowledge on what they eat, their parts, their breed and more, said former 4-H member and long-time judge Carolyn Lawrence.\nFor meat goats, who are bred and raised to become a meal on someone's plate, the 4-H members start working with them once they are born in January or March. A few weeks later, once they're weaned from their mothers they start training them to walk with a halter and lead line, taking them on mile long walks several times a week, according to Libby Kondracki, Tails and Trails leader.\nWhen it comes to show day at the fair, Carter washes her goat in the morning and covers him to ensure he stays clean white. Since they're raised for meat, she then blow dries the animals to get them looking as fluffy as possible. According to county fair regulations, no baby powder, artificial coloring, or adhesives like hairspray can be used on the animals.\n\"The power in fitting your animal, and knowing how to fit your animal and showing your animal to make it to where you know you're showing this animal the best you can to its fullest potential. You really have to work with your goat,\" Carter said.\nBefore the fair, members get together at least twice a week and meet up as a show team and prepare together. Many of the 4-H parent leaders were 4-H members themselves when they were growing up. And many current members plan to stay involved after they age out at 18 years old to continue to give back to the community that helped shape them.\n\"I really love teaching them,\" said Carter about helping teach younger 4-H'ers. \"Because they're going to be, you know, when I'm done in two more years, they're going to be the ones that are taking over. So you really want them to be the mentor you kids that you were to them.\"\nAlthough many 4-H members compete against each other at the Cecil County Fair, they are all a team at the end of the day.\n\"When one wins, we all win,\" said Carter.\nIn addition to the camaraderie 4-H supplies, it also helps educate the public about the livestock they often consume.\nThanks to being involved in the Rising Sun 4-H Club for the past four years, Mason Gentry enjoys educating the public about his animals and their purposes. For example, he explained the importance of knowing that a Heifer is a female cow who has not been bred yet, a cow is a female cow who has been bred and had a calf, and a Steer is a male cow that's been castrated and is meant for beef.\n\"The goal of the fair is to educate the public about agriculture, give them an opportunity to see where the food comes from,\" said Mark Barczewki, 4-H Barn Stompers club leader. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Farm family brings Emily’s Produce 'full circle' in its 25th year\n\n July 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 580\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Kelly Jackson feels that everything is coming \"full circle\" for Emily's Produce, a family farm business that she and her husband, Paul, started 25 years ago.Their oldest daughter, Emily Wright, the namesake of the business, grew up around the farm every day as a child. Her parents, Paul and Kelly Jackson, opened a produce tent in 1999, hoping to teach their newborn daughter about the family farm's tradition.\nWright and her younger brother, Kyle Jackson, are seventh generation farmers.\nWhen Wright went off to college at Delaware Valley University and secured a degree in agribusiness, her parents didn't pressure her to return to the family farm.\n\"A lot of other farm families are forced, the kids have to come back and work,\" Wright said. \"But she made us go try things that really made us want to come back instead of just having to come back.\"\nWright greatly appreciated that freedom of choice. She worked at the Department of Natural Resources after college, soon realizing that an office job wasn't a fit. She \"needed to be outside, hands in the dirt.\"\n\"There's nothing like working with your family,\" Wright said. She committed last year to working full-time at Emily's Produce.\nWright and her brother work in tandem, with Wright \"on the scene\" in the farm store and handling social media, while Kyle is \"behind the scenes,\" she said. Emily's Produce has around 100 acres of fruits and vegetables and about 800 additional acres, which Kyle, currently a student at the University of Maryland, and his father work on, mainly as grain farmers.\nOpen six days a week on Church Creek Road, Emily's Produce is a haven for customers who want to shop local and farm-to-table.\nIn addition to the locally-grown produce, the business has homemade baked goods and desserts, a deli kitchen and a flower field. It offers a \"U-Pick\" season, where customers can pick their own strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, pumpkins and flowers when the fields and patches are in season.\nWright, who got married last year, recently discovered the popularity of the farm's wildflower patch for weddings. Her wedding flowers were all from the farm, and with around 50 varieties, it's been a hit with wedding vendors.\n\"It's that keeping your finger on the pulse of what people want,\" Kelly Jackson said. \"I don't think maybe 10 years ago, people wanted wildflowers … for their wedding. But now it's whimsical, it's cool … and it supports local farmers.\"\nTwo-and-a-half decades later, the farm stand has grown \"organically,\" Jackson said, from its humble beginnings as a small tent on the side of the road. And in the landmark 25th year, the seventh generation is taking leadership in operating the business.\nJackson is excited for what Kyle will bring to the farm as he enters his junior year in college, studying agricultural business and management.\n\"We've never been able to grow tree fruit, just because of the geography and the land and the soil,\" she said. \"Now that he's involved and he's studying agriculture, we're relying on him to be the consultation to us, the voice of what's new. I think whatever is new, Kyle will be a part of.\"\nThe involvement from both Kyle and Emily has been a relief and joy to Kelly and Paul Jackson, the mother said. She admitted she was worried her children might not return to continue the family tradition, though that didn't change her perspective on giving them the space and time to explore for themselves.\n\"We're doing our happy dance this year,\" Kelly Jackson said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No experience is necessary and there is no age limit to gleaning, but children under the age of 16 must be accompanied by an adult.\nGleaning event announcements are often short notice and volunteers can sign up to receive notifications through the volunteer section of the Maryland Food Bank website.\nUnderstanding gleaning field work isn't for everyone, volunteers are also encouraged to lend a hand at community food pantry locations.\n\"Gleaning is just a small way you can help,\" Cawley said.\nMore information including ways to give can be found at www.mdfoodbank.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Todd, president of the Eastern Shore Thresherman and Collectors Association, said, \"We are trying to preserve our American agricultural heritage through demonstrations. We have equipment and show people how farming was done years ago, bring back by-gone days.\"\nThe event is entirely run by volunteers.\nBob Miller, of Nice Farms Creamery, makes fresh ice cream from his own Jersey cows near the fairgrounds. His engine-run ice cream maker was loud, attracting a crowd.\n\"We like being a part of this because it keeps agricultural heritage alive,\" Miller said. \"This is how the old timers used to make ice cream with their parents. Salt and ice will always work.\"\nHistory was the main emphasis of the day, as evidenced by several demonstrations and displays.\nIn another corner of the grounds, Dale Foxwell had everything from cannon, to a military campsie to pistols on display — all from the Civil War era.\n\"This is a living history display trying to give people a little bit of an idea of some of the firearms used during the war between the states period,\" Foxwell said.\nPeople interested in mechanics and farm machines were met with an array of vintages and manufacturers, like John Deere and Case. There were dozens of tractors in rows. People took the time to inspect them and talk about each part that made up the whole machine.\nThere was even Smokey Joe Railroad, one the few steam-powered mini trains left in the country. This 1961-built miniature steam engine ran a loop, tooted its steam whistle and delighted children of all ages.\nTodd Kerchner, the train's engineer, said, \"I started doing this when I was 12 or 13. Today we will make hundreds of runs. We go all day.\"\nJohn Geib, who ran the train every other loop, said, \"I love the smiles. They love coming back. They hate getting off.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Initially, they delivered the veggies to neighborhoods surrounding the church, but that proved to be too labor intensive, so they switched to the weekly farm stand.\nApproximately 10 people help plant the garden each year, and a core group of six to eight volunteers maintain it throughout the summer.\nThe project is led by longtime church member Karen Dunn, who said she learned her gardening skills from her father. She added that she enjoys meeting the people who come to pick up vegetables every week.\n\"It's really exciting and it's really special,\" Dunn said. \"The main reason we wanted to do it was to reach out to the community, get to know people and let them get to know us. That is really, really neat. We get to pray for people, we get to invite them to the church.\"\nPritchett said the garden and farm stand are an important resource for the community during a time of rising food prices.\n\"Is it going to solve everybody's problems? No, but it might solve somebody's problems,\" he said. \"It might get somebody a healthy meal.\"\nKelly Pritchett, the pastor's wife, said she enjoys getting to know the regular \"customers\" who stop by every week.\n\"We're trying to build relationships over time,\" she said. \"Some of them will share about their lives and ask us to maybe pray for someone who is sick or something like that. It's nice to get to build those relationships.\"\nKaren Weber, another longtime church member, also enjoys running the farm stand.\n\"We just want to bless the community in some way,\" Weber said. \"That's what churches should do.\"\nGrace Church's farm stand, located in the church parking lot at 355 Paper Mill Road, is open every Saturday from 9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Both of their families arrived in the United States in the 1700's. Eventually, the Covingtons' settled in Queen Anne's County. Beth's ancestors landed on the Eastern Shore of Virginia and migrated to Mississippi.Henry's great-grandfather, also called Henry, was a Methodist minister at three local churches, Burrisville, Starr, and Salem near Church Hill. His son (Henry's grandfather), Edward, was a preacher and tenant farmer. Henry's dad, Henry Sr., preached for a while, but then began a career with New York Life Insurance.\nIn 1979, Henry Sr. and his wife Kathryn, bought the Peace and Plenty Farm from the Wright family and started farming. Henry Sr. always said there were two things his father approved of during the year other than work and going to church; attending the 4-H fair and riding to Rehoboth Beach for the day! To get there, all nine kids piled in the back of a 6-wheel truck filled with straw! Henry's mother, Kathryn, was raised on the Richard family farm near Templeville, along with her 12 siblings.\nBeth was born in Mississippi where her maternal grandparents, the Dilworths, farmed. She moved to Kent Island at the age of 4, when her dad began working for Maryland DNR. Beth's family also had their faith, it was a big part of growing up and they attended church regularly. After graduating from Chesapeake College, Beth attended the University of Maryland Dental School, earning her degree in dental hygiene.\nHenry graduated from the University of Delaware with a degree in Plant Science. Spring of his junior year, he attended a semester at Chesapeake College and met Beth. Henry was recruited by some high school friends at Chesapeake to play baseball. At one baseball practice, Henry noticed one of the softball players. She was wearing red shorts and Henry asked one of his teammates \"who is that girl in the red shorts?\". Henry was told it was Beth, his friend Earl's little sister. Beth mentioned \"since she was a couple years younger than her brother, no one noticed her until college!\". After the chance meeting at baseball and softball practice, they dated and were married in 1982.\nIn 1980, Henry started working at Agrico and Crop Production Services, selling fertilizer and Pioneer seed. Henry had his first opportunity to rent a farm on his own from Gladys Cahall. His grandmother was Cahall's Sunday school teacher so she knew Henry's family very well.\nHenry enjoyed farming with his dad for many years. After 10 years, Henry became a full time Pioneer sales rep while also farming over 1300 acres. Henry and Beth dreamed of owning their own farm, and in 2001 that dream came true. They bought a farm near Centreville, and named it Broadland. After 30 years, Henry retired from the seed business in 2021. A good friend, Anton Roe now continues the business as a local Pioneer sales rep. Henry and Beth continue to farm.\nHenry and Beth have three children; Will, Ben, and Sarah. Will graduated from Washington and Lee University and is now working as a systems engineer for Communications Electronics Systems Integrated. Ben graduated from Iowa State University. He works for the University and John Deere as an agricultural and biosystems engineer. Sarah graduated from the University of Richmond with a degree in Biology. Sarah teaches biology at Queen Anne's County High School.\nBeth had worked off the farm as a part-time dental hygienist for 38 years. This allowed her to take care of the kids and help on the farm. Their three kids were actively involved in 4-H, showing pigs, steers, and rabbits, and entering indoor exhibits. Henry was recruited by Paul Gunther to help with the open farm crops at the fair and to assist the Godfreys with open vegetables. Henry and Beth gladly did this for over 30 years.\nAfter the kids had all left home and Beth retired as a dental hygienist, she had time to work on one of her hobbies, quilting. She said, \"My grandmother sewed and taught me to sew. I started out making doll clothes and then made clothes for myself, and later, my kids. After the kids left home, I started to quilt\". Beth has been generous in her quilting talents, giving quilts as gifts and donating them to people in need.\nAbout the same time Henry started collecting old tractors. His first was a 1958 John Deere 730. The 730 was one of his favorite childhood toys and 1958 was the year in which he was born. At some point Beth mentioned she would like to have a Farmall cub, like the one she remembered Mr. Ernest Porter owning. Henry found a 1960 cub right away (the same year she was born!) Mr. Ernest Porter was a wonderful Christian man who was very dear to both Henry and Beth. Mr. Ernest Porter was a big influence in Henry's life. \"He never seemed to get upset\" Henry said. He was also a faithful member of Beth's church on Kent Island.\nHenry and Beth consider themselves so very blessed to have had all the experiences that come with living in our farming community. They have thoroughly enjoyed supporting and serving others through their church, 4-H, and school activities. Henry said with a smile \"people are generally good and giving back to your community keeps our community close\". He said \"my father never missed a 4-H Fair up until his passing and I feel the same way. The fair is a good way to stay involved and see people…Everyone should give some of their time to their community. That's how we teach the next generation.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

For older kids, there was a mechanical bull.\nThe Reger Pavilion had live music. Everything from the old-timey country sound of the Jone's Brothers to the foot stomping Amish Outlaws and '80s-inflected The Reagan Years.\nThere were lots of competitions to show younger community members' efforts to raise dairy cows, goats, swines, horses, rabbits and beef.\nJody Neal, Caroline County FFA Advisor and ag teacher at Caroline Career and Technology Center had lots of students participating in fair contests.\n\"I have nine kids showing animals today. I have kids showing sheep, swine, market goats and breed goats,\" Neal said.\nThe students raise their animals for a year leading up to the fair. After all that effort, the animals ended up at the livestock auction on Saturday night. This sale funds the students' project for next year. The pork can go back into the school system and is served in the lunch line.\nSkyler Blunt, a participant in the swine competition, said it was rewarding to show a year's worth of work.\n\"I have two Hereford barrows and one Yorkshire gilt,\" Blunt said. \"The best part is the accomplishment that the fair brings you and getting to show people your project for the year.\"\nEmma Boyle, 18, who had just graduated from high school, said, \"I am showing two crossbred pigs. I have been doing this since I was five. I love it. This is my last year. My pigs are named Buzz and Woody.\"\nBarbara Carrow, who was announcing the swine show, is co-leader of Pure Country 4-H Club. She has 62 kids in her Caroline County chapter. They showed at least 50 swine at the contest.\n\"I love working with young people, and I love animals. It teaches them responsibility and how to interact with adults other people. It gives them confidence,\" Carrow said.\nWandering in the crowd was a princess — the Dairy Princess.\nCaroline Kimball of Queen Anne's County High School wears a sash and a tiara.\n\"I am the Eastern Shore Dairy Princess because I represent the dairy industry. I like educating people about the dairy industry. You can add a dairy product to all three meals of the day. I like chocolate milk after practice. I want to major in animal science,\" Kimball said.\nThe judge, Gabe Zepp of Carroll County, picked first, second and third place winners. With every participant, win or lose, he offered instruction on how to improve.\n\"I want to see these hogs with their heads up at all times. Head placement. I want to see that they are comfortable with a whip. Nice and in control of the hog,\" Zepp said.\nNavonne Owen, 4-H Educator for Caroline County, said, \"They have all worked so hard on their projects and this is the time to shine. They are all doing an excellent job. They are resilient and flexible and they are learning so many life skills from the project. It will help them in the future.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Fair dedicated to Michael Cohey Sr.\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DOUG BISHOP Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 462\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — Monday evening, Aug. 12, as part of the Queen Anne's County 4-H Fair opening ceremonies, held annually at the 4-H Park in Centreville, lifelong Queen Anne's resident, and past Farm Bureau President Michael Cohey Sr. was recognized and honored to have this year's fair dedicated to him. This year is the 82nd annual Queen Anne's County Fair, which began in 1942, and is ranked as one of the top county fairs in the state of Maryland, running six-days, Monday through Saturday evening.Born and raised on the family farm, just north of Church Hill, Cohey, was presented a plaque by Queen Anne's County Fair Chair Laura Leager, recognizing his lifetime of service to the agricultural community.\nCohey attended and graduated from the former Charlotte Hall Military Academy (on a senatorial scholarship) in St. Mary's County before attending Chesapeake College as a general studies major for two years. Afterward, he farmed with his father, and on his own, first as a dairy farmer, and later transitioning completely to grain farming.\nLater, he took a long-time job with Pioneer Hybrid Seed Company where he served as a salesman until retiring two years ago, at the age of 70. He's still an active farmer.\nCohey has served as past president of the Queen Anne's County Farm Bureau.\nIn 1992, the Cohey family lost their only son, the late Michael Cohey Jr. at the age of 9. Michael Jr. contracted a rare form of childhood cancer. Before the cancer, Michael Jr. would attend the fair with his father, as they manned the Pioneer Seed booth. From his youngest age, Michael Jr. learned to love the fair and made many friends there. He developed a love for rabbits and had hoped to show rabbits when he became a full-fledged 4-H member when he turned 8 years old.\nThe cancer prevented Michael Jr. from achieving that dream.\nSince his death, his father has sponsored two annual 4-H youth awards: sponsoring the rabbit bred and owned class at the county fair and the annual Michael Cohey Jr. Memorial Award to the Clover (under 8 years old) 4-H child who writes the most outstanding 4-H personal experience story each year. Those awards have been presented for 30-plus years to more than 60 children involved in 4-H.\nHad Michael Jr. survived the cancer, he would now be 41-years old.\nTwo-years ago, the father purchased the new rabbit shed that stores all of the supplies and equipment that the county fair rabbit show needs to operate.\nThe honor of the fair being dedicated to individuals began in 1976 and has been awarded to more than 40 people from the county and many local organizations that have contributed substantially to the farming and welfare of the community. in general. Cohey said, \"I am very, very honored to receive this recognition.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Digging and cooking sweet potatoes\n\n October 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1317\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n One of the last large gardening jobs to do when I was young was to dig those sweet potatoes.My parents would gently loosen the soil around the plants and take a peek at the plants whose leaves were slightly yellow and turning back. These were the signs the potatoes were ready to dig. The baskets for storage were already pulled out and waiting for the big day.\nMy family enjoyed growing sweet potatoes, as once planted they required very little attention and were drought tolerant. They grew in their own space — not sprouting and growing wildly. We ate a lot of both the white potato and the sweet potato, a major staple on the winter dinner table.\nThe Saturday for digging was chosen, the family notified, the tractor with attached farm wagon readied, and the shed prepared for storage next to the crop of white potatoes already completed.\nThe pickup trucks lined the lane as family and friends arrived for the digging. After several cups of Ms. Laura's coffee, the crew began working.\nMy sister and I were assigned the job of \"getting the dinner ready.\" This was not a dinner — it was a small banquet. Mom had made two pots of soup. One was homemade vegetable beef, and the other was lima bean soup. Waiting to be baked were several dozens of homemade biscuits.\nI wanted to get outside to help, but oh no, my sister needed help with the dishes. No paper plates or bowls could be found on West Line Road.\nLet's enjoy these fresh dug sweet potatoes with some old and new recipes.\nSWEET POTATO CHIPS2 large sweet potatoes, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1/4 tsp sea salt.\nPreheat the oven to 250 degrees and position the oven rack in the center of the oven. Rinse and dry your sweet potatoes thoroughly and slice them as uniformly thin as possible (1/8 inch thick slices). If you have a mandolin, use it. Otherwise, use a very sharp knife to get these uniformly thin. Know that chips that are too thick in parts won't crisp up all the way. Still delicious, just not \"chip\" crispiness. Toss slices in a touch of olive oil to lightly coat, then sprinkle with salt.\nLay out in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for about 1 hour 30 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes, flipping chips once at halfway point to ensure even cooking. Thickness of slices will impact cooking time. Check at 10-minute intervals during the second hour of cooking to ensure they aren't burning. Remove once crisp and golden brown. Some may feel a little tender in the middle but take them out and let them rest for 10 minutes or so to crisp up before sampling. Serve immediately.\nSWEET POTATO PANCAKES1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 2 tbsp packed brown sugar, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, 1 3/4 cup buttermilk, 2 small sweet potatoes (roasted and pureed until smooth), 2 large eggs, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract, butter for cooking and serving.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. In a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk and sweet potato puree, then add eggs and vanilla. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined. Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. When butter is foamy, reduce heat to medium-low and ladle a scant ½ cup pancake batter into the skillet. Cook until bubbles start to form in batter and the pancake is golden underneath, about 3 minutes, then flip and cook the other side until golden, another 3 minutes. Serve with more butter, toasted pecans and maple syrup.\nSWEET POTATO CASSEROLE2 lb. sweet potatoes, extra virgin olive oil for drizzling, Kosher salt, 1/2 cup unsalted butter (room temperature) plus more for pan, 1 cup granulated sugar, 2 large eggs (beaten to blend), 1 tsp pure vanilla extract. BROWN SUGAR CRUST: 1/2 cup chopped raw pecans, 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 2 tbsp unsalted butter (melted).\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees and line a 11-by-7-inch (or 2-quart) baking dish with foil. Rinse and scrub potatoes to dislodge any dirt, then pat dry. Using a fork, poke holes all over the potatoes. Drizzle with oil; season all over with salt. Transfer potatoes to prepared pan and roast, uncovered, until cooked through and flesh is easily pierced with a fork or paring knife, 60 to 65 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a large heatproof bowl. Discard foil and grease pan with butter. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, remove skins.\nIn the large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or in a large bowl, using an electric mixer), beat potatoes and granulated sugar on medium speed until sugar is incorporated and potatoes are mashed. Add butter and beat until incorporated and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs, vanilla, and 3/4 teaspoon salt and beat until mixture is almost doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture into the prepared pan and spread with a spatula. Bake the casserole until the center is set but slightly jiggly and edges are beginning to brown, about 35 minutes. Let cool slightly.\nBROWN SUGAR CRUST: Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine pecans, brown sugar, flour, and salt, breaking up any clumps of sugar with your fingers. Drizzle in butter and toss with a fork until combined. Sprinkle brown sugar mixture over potatoes. Continue to bake the casserole until the crust is firm and starts to brown, about 10 minutes more. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.\nSWEET POTATO BISCUITS9 ounces all-purpose flour, 1 tbsp baking powder, 2 tsp kosher salt, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 4 ounces cold unsalted butter cut into 1/2-inch cubes, 9 ounces sweet potato purée from one large sweet potato, 3 ounces milk.\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400 degrees. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a medium bowl, then whisk until well combined (this may take up to 1 minute). Add the butter, toss to break up the pieces, and smash each cube flat. Continue smashing and rubbing until the butter has mostly disappeared into a floury mix, although a few larger, Cheerio-sized pieces may remain.\nThis can also be done with 4 or 5 pulses in a food processor, just take care not to overdo it. The prepared mix can be refrigerated up to 3 weeks in an airtight container, then used as directed below. Mash the sweet potato purée and milk together with a fork, or combine with an immersion blender until perfectly smooth. Add to the dry mix in a large bowl, and fold with a flexible spatula until fully absorbed. The dough will seem rather crumbly and dry at first, but keep mixing until it finally comes together. Once the dough forms a rough ball, turn out onto a lightly floured surface. With your bare hands, gently pat the dough into a squarish shape about 1/2-inch thick, then fold in half; repeat twice more for a total of 3 folds, using only enough flour to keep your hands from sticking.\nFinish by patting the dough to a thickness of 3/4 inch. If needed, dust away any excess flour, then cut into 1 3/4-inch rounds and arrange in a 10-inch cast iron skillet. Gather scraps into a ball, pat and fold a single time, then cut as many more biscuits as you can. The final round of scraps can be gathered and shaped into a single biscuit by hand. Bake until the biscuits are well-risen and golden brown, about 25 minutes (or longer if cut thicker than 3/4-inch). Let the biscuits cool about 5 minutes to help set their crumb, then serve. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Stauffer said that would run to the south of the museum and be the closer connection. However, the timeline on that is not set because the county has not yet awarded the contract, Stauffer said.\nCCFM received $95,000 in a 2021 bond bill from the Maryland General Assembly and $150,000 from the Upper Shore Regional Council.

    "content": "Schillinger farm family honored as QA 'Cooperator of the Year'\n\n October 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DOUG BISHOP Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 508\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — On Sept. 26, the annual Queen Anne's Soil Conservation District hosted its banquet to honor the top farm in the county, recognized as the \"Cooperator of the Year.\" This year's honoree was the James D. Schillinger family, owners of Schillinger Farm Inc., located in the northeastern portion of Centreville.The award goes to a Queen Anne's County farm that is not only very successful in producing a profitable agriculture venture, but also practices a variety of sound environmental methods that help conserve the farm lands from a number of hazards. Those practices are preventing soil erosion through sediment run-offs, wetland creation, grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous cover, nutrient management, soil and water conservation planning, cover crops, no-till, and minimal tillage.\nSchillinger Farm has saved 137 tons of soil — 6,475 pounds of nitrogen reduction and 342 pounds of phosphorus per year.\nThe banquet began with Conservation District Executive Director Tony Riggi welcoming the nearly 100 guests. The event was hosted at the Centreville American Legion, Jeff Davis Post 18. Riggi introduced Chairman of the Board Steve Freeman, who introduced a number of guests.\nA hot meal was provided by volunteers from Post 18.\nFollowing the meal, Conservation District assistant Joe Pippin read the history of the Schillinger Farm family's accomplishments — a long history that began on the western shore. Jimmy's great grandfather bought their home farm from the Baltimore Coal Company in 1881 (Papa John Produce, off of Rt. 97). They grew apples, tobacco and sweet potatoes.\nWith a huge market for sweet potatoes, they would sell 25,000 boxes of sweet potatoes before Thanksgiving. When Jimmy was a junior in high school, his father went to work for the State Tobacco Authority and told Jimmy it was up to him to run the farm.\n\"Jimmy began to expand the business by incorporating more variety of vegetables, fruits, flowers and building greenhouses on the farm. They had 36 greenhouse on the farm at one time, and 22,000 hanging baskets of flowers. . . They would sell to grocery stores like Giant Foods, and Grauls Markets,\" Pippin read.\nJimmy met his wife, Gina, when she came to work on the farm when she was 14. She had many jobs on the farm, including cashier, inventory and logistics, delivery driver, and security guard.\"\nIn 1987, the state began to buy some property from the farm to build the new Old Mill High School (in Millersville). It was then, as major developments began to happen in that portion of Anne Arundel County, that the Schillinger's considered moving to Queen Anne's County to continue farming. In 1995, they purchased \"the Price Farm\" on 301.\nSince then, they have purchased a few more farms and switched their farming operation to mainly grain crop rotation of 1,100 acres while still doing some vegetables and 380 flower hanging baskets.\nSons J.D. and Brady Schillinger plan to carry on the farming operation and are currently starting their own beef herd. The Schillinger family has continued to be stewards of the land throughout the years. They are conserving the land and water with practices previously mentioned. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Celebrating fall apples\n\n October 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1348\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The 32nd Annual Apple and Scrapple Festival will be held in Bridgeville, Delaware on Oct. 11 and 12. Friday starts at 4 p.m. with opening celebrations, and Saturday begins at 9 a.m. There will be something for everyone — games, rides, food, crafts, displays of old farm equipment and classic cars.The event's name comes from the two agricultural products produced in the area — apples and scrapple. This festival was named in the top 100 events in North America by the American Business Association.\nThis week I am doing apples and saving our scrapple recipes for my mid-winter \"old fashioned hog slaughtering on the farm.\"\nWhen it comes to apple pie, a Braeburn's flavor sweetens and concentrates during cooking to evoke a hint of spice, which makes it a natural pick for pie. And since Braeburns don't release much liquid during cooking, they won't lead to a runny filling or soggy pie crust.\nIf you want extra sweetness without the soft texture, choose Gala apples for your pie.\nGranny Smiths are typically my go-to apple for baking, so I'll always have them on hand during the fall months. Their tart, citrusy flavor makes them perfect for sweet baked goods, where there's sugar in the recipe. I love using these for homemade caramel apples too.\nWhen I was growing up, the orchards offered already picked or u-pick, and mom liked getting her own. She separated the apples into three categories: some for homemade applesauce, some for fbaking and some to eat fresh. What a wonderful smell filled the air as we canned and baked.\nHOMEMADE APPLE PIEDOUBLE PIE CRUST: 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tbsps white granulated sugar, 1 1/2 tsps kosher salt, 1 cup unsalted butter (cold), 3/4 cups very cold water (divided). APPLE PIE FILLING: 1/2 small lemon juiced (about 1 1/2 tbsps), 3-4 whole medium to large apples (peeled, halved, cored and thinly sliced), 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup light brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsps ground cinnamon, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract or 1/2 tsp vanilla paste, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 2 tbsps sour cream, 1 large beaten egg (for egg wash).\nIn a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar and salt. Using a box grater, grate the cold butter atop the flour mixture. Transfer to the freezer to chill for 10 minutes. Working quickly, and using your hands, break the butter bits into the flour until they're evenly distributed and resemble the size of teeny, small peas. Add 50% of the recommended water and mix. The mixture will be shaggy at this point. From here, add 1 tbsp of water at a time until the dough comes together. Flour your counter and dump the dough onto it. Knead a few times more until it comes together into one cohesive mass. Divide the dough, forming two discs. Wrap the discs in plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 hour, ideally overnight.\nAdd the apple slices to a large bowl. Squeeze in the lemon juice, being sure to catch any seeds. Add the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract and salt; toss until the apples are evenly coated.\nRemove the first disc of dough from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature for about 5 minutes. Liberally flour your work surface and rolling pin. Begin to roll the dough, being sure to rotate it every so often to avoid sticking to a 13-inch round. Wrap the dough around the rolling pin and unroll it over the pie dish. Gently fit the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pie tin. Trim the dough around the pie tin, leaving about a 1/2-inch overhang. Recombine the scraps and set them aside. We'll use them for the lattice. Transfer the pie shell to the refrigerator while you roll out the second disc.\nRemove the second disc from the fridge and repeat the rolling process. Using a knife, cut the dough into 3-inch strips. I cut as many 3-inch strips as I can. Re-roll the scraps you have set aside, too, you'll need all of the pie dough. (If at any time your pie dough becomes too soft, transfer to a cutting board and put in the fridge to chill so it's easier to work with.) Fill your pie shell with the apple filling. Lay out 5 strips of pie dough on top of the filling, leaving about 1/2-inch of space in between them. Lay the remainder of your strips running perpendicular. This will give you a good idea of how it will go. Next, fold back every strip. Start one at the top, running horizontally. and weave it under and over, rotating, each strip running vertically. Repeat this process until you've worked your way through every strip\nTrim the edges of the strips, being sure to leave about 1-inch overhang. Going all the way around, tuck the edges under. To make a pronounced crimp, like you see pictured, set your thumb on the outside edge of the crust. With your opposite pointer and thumb fingers, create a v, and push the two together. Repeat this process all the way around the pie crust. Transfer to the freezer to chill for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Brush the entire pie, liberally, with egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Transfer the pie to a baking sheet and place in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges are just lightly brown. Turn the heat down to 350 degrees F and bake for another 40 to 45 minutes, until the edges and top are deep golden brown. Be sure to check on it intermittently, if at any time the pie crust begins to turn too dark, use foil to cover those areas to stop browning. Allow to stand for at least two hours so it can firm up before slicing the pie. Serve with ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.\nTo save some time you make the pie dough ahead. You can freeze it for up to 3 months. To make the pie ahead. You can assemble this entire pie and stick it in the freezer overnight and then bake it off the next day.\nCover lightly with a clean kitchen towel and store on the kitchen counter. I find that the fridge makes the dough soggy because of the moisture.\nUPSIDE DOWN APPLE PIE2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 6 tbsps shortening, 2 tbsps cold butter, 5 to 7 tbsps orange juice. FILLING:6 tbsps butter (melted, divided), 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 cup chopped pecans, 8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (about 1/8 inch thick), 1 cup sugar, 1/3 cup all-purpose flour, 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg. GLAZE:1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, 2 to 3 tsps orange juice.\nIn a large bowl, combine flour and salt; cut in shortening and butter until crumbly. Gradually add orange juice, tossing with a fork until dough forms a ball. Divide dough into two balls. Wrap in plastic; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Line a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate with heavy-duty foil, leaving 1-1/2 inches beyond edge; coat the foil with cooking spray. Combine 4 tbsps butter, brown sugar and pecans; spoon into prepared pie plate. In a large bowl, combine the apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and remaining butter; toss gently. On waxed paper, roll out one ball of pastry to fit the pie plate. Place pastry over nut mixture, pressing firmly against mixture and sides of plate; trim to 1 in. beyond plate edge. Fill with apple mixture. Roll out remaining pastry to fit on top of pie; place over filling. Trim to 1/4 inch beyond plate edge. Fold bottom pastry over top pastry; seal and flute edges. Cut four 1-inch slits in top pastry. Bake at 375 degrees for 50-55 minutes or until the apples are tender and crust is golden brown (cover edges with foil during the last 20 minutes to prevent overbrowning if necessary).Cool for 15 minutes on a wire rack. Invert onto a serving platter; carefully remove foil. Combine glaze ingredients, drizzle over pie. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County landowners offer different perspectives on expanding solar\n\n October 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 575\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Converting Caroline County land into solar is a contentious issue.Some landowners see a chance to repurpose their land, add to the tax base and make some money. Others think it is against the rural character of the county.\nDave Tribbet owns farmland in Ridgely. He said he has been approached a couple of times by solar companies, and he has declined their offers.\n\"If you are taking up farmland, is solar going to feed anybody? I don't like solar. I am an adamant farmer who believes in feeding people,\" Tribbett said.\nBut he acknowledges that not all farmers in the county take the same stance on the issue as he does. He said he sees some landowners going for solar, attracted by the stable profits that farming can't always provide.\n\"A lot of the younger generations that inherited farms, that did not do the work, the backbone of the farm, to really appreciate the farm, and they see the money that is offered them. They are the ones probably jumping in on that,\" Tribbett said. \"There is less risk, and they are guaranteed the pay at the end of the day.\"\nAnother farmer, Jim Lewis, sold 200 acres, a part of his farm, to Enel, a multinational corporation, for the Waypost Solar Project. It is near Templeville and Marydel.\nEnel claims it will supply carbon-free electricity to 15,000 homes with this project. The company bought land from nine landowners and have 550 panel acres.\n\"I am not one to say 'everything is for sale,' but at the right price 'everything is for sale.' They offered 1.5 times my land's value. The piece of land was not the best farmland that I farmed. If I can trade one piece of land and walk away with some money, then I essentially doubled the size of the land that I had by doing it,\" Lewis said.\n\"If I can make $1,000 an acre with solar, and I can only make $100 growing corn or soy beans, it is back to economics,\" Lewis said. He later added that because he is making more money off the land, more of his income can be collected in taxes.\nSolar relies on the transmission lines in Caroline County, which are used to move the energy. If land is not adjacent to the lines, it isn't as useful to solar companies.\nThe county government has put a cap of 2,000 acres that are available for solar development. Most of those acres have been developed already.\nDecommissioning, the process of dismantling the solar panels and steel posts at the end of their lives, has county leadership worried that solar will leave an eyesore that is hard to get rid of.\nLewis said that solar companies have told him that when 20 years go by, they will take the panels because they are valuable.\n\"If they leave me a farm that has steel stakes that the panels were on, I can with a mini excavator with a thumb and a roll off can, I can clean up 20 or 30 acres a day and make it back into ag productive land,\" Lewis said.\nBut Lewis said he can see the aesthetic downside. And he can see if you are a farmer that rents land, that solar is competition.\n\"The commissioners shouldn't care about people's private business deals,\" Lewis said.\nAt a council meeting Commissioner Larry Porter said, \"This is a fight that we better gear up for. I am not going to see this county covered in solar.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

As owner of Green's Septic, he and his employee of six years Pete Padley enjoy educating kids on the vehicles each year.\nOther than the big trucks, local and state emergency personnel were on site giving demonstrations.\nChief Logan Quinn from the Kent County Office of Emergency Services had lifesaving items on display: cardiac heart equipment, CPR devices and a pediatric response bag.\nChestertown Police Chief Ron Dixon presented some everyday tools they use to assist the public: bolt cutters, pry bars and jumper cables.\n\"When people see these items, we hope they see we're there for the community,\" Dixon said.\nWith a generous crowd scattered throughout the large grounds, it was calm, a good environment to learn, talking to equipment operators.\nThat calm was momentarily shattered at around 11:30 a.m. when a helicopter from the Maryland State Police was spotted hovering over the grounds. As soon as the chopper touched grass, kids and adults made a beeline to it, excited to get a tour.\n\"It's an impressive bird,\" said airline pilot of 25 years John Strigle. As a civilian volunteer he had a wealth of knowledge he shared along with the state police operators.\nThey answered questions, letting kids sit in the Agusta Westland AW139, creating lots of memories and providing parents with photo opportunities.\nOther than vehicles, the various Kent County 4-H clubs manned stations running activities for the public to enjoy. The Kent Fuzzy Tails & Shiny Scales group allowed a chance to pet the rabbits, talk to their owners and participate in a prize-winning activity.\nPrincipal Agent Associate, 4-H Youth Development Kent County, Beth Hill, behind an inventive bike/blender making pumpkin smoothies, said these kinds of events help generate new members.\nIn addition kids participated in a hay bale toss and Tic Tac Toe with pumpkins, while Matt Jones gave hayrides and various organizations like Rock Hall Dental fielded questions at tables.\nCo-organizer Cindy Moore said Touch-a-truck came about to show appreciation to the 4-H clubs who maintained the place year-round.\nShe thanked everyone for showing up that day.\n\"We all work together on this,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Following the land sale from the church, the garden had to look for a new home and McKnight reached out to the County Commissioners over the summer for assistance.\nFormed in 2015 as the Galilee Community Garden, the Kent Island Community Garden serves the need for a community garden in the Harbor View area of Chester and has since blossomed to include church volunteers, local Master Gardeners, Boy Scout Troop 495 and neighbors of all sorts ready to get their thumbs green.\nThe community garden also partners with the University of Maryland Extension Master Gardeners Program for educational opportunities.\nThe garden offers many beds of vegetables, flowers, and a separate herb garden with an irrigation system and compost area.\nThe Maryland Food Bank cites that one in three Marylanders face hunger. \"With several of our gardeners in independent living facilities and one handicapped gardener, we realize how critical it is to establish a new space for our community garden,\" McKnight said.\nVoicing their appreciation for the garden, the county Commissioners approved a $1,500 grant to help the garden blossom at its new location.\nThe new location's property next to the offices of the Fire Marshal is an ideal location to offer sufficient land for growth along with the necessary utilities as well as close proximity to the Cross-Island Trail, local schools, and the public library.\n\"It's going to be a great resource for the county,\" McKnight said.\nThe Kent Island Community Garden is always looking for new gardeners and civic minded groups to help build garden beds, according to McKnight.\nThe all inclusive garden stakes claim in having the only handicapped-accessible garden beds in the county, he said.\n\"We are a diverse and unique group of twenty gardeners and are the only community garden in Queen Anne's County that is open to all, \" McKnight said.\nLooking ahead, the garden hopes to build a few garden beds before winter sets in and In the spring seeks funds to install a deer fence around the perimeter, he said.\nMore information about Kent Island Community Garden can be found by contacting McKnight at McKnightJohn143@gmail.com or 202-257-3754. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The fall menu is quite different from the summer menu.One of my greatest memories from childhood was mom and the neighbor ladies out on the farm cutting those greens by the basket and carrying them up to the outside milk kitchen, where fresh tubs of cold water waited to rinse the greens four to five times.\nOn a Saturday morning, the ladies came to get the fresh growing greens — Mom enjoyed sharing the abundant supply before the frost hit and destroyed them. Many times, we cut and cooked the greens for the church dinners.\nI still cook them like mom, but I buy them at the produce stands and get my seasoning meat from the farmers market — farm girls call it \"strip of lean and strip of fat\" seasoning meat. You can also use those ham hocks, which are great for bean soup seasoning.\nI am going to run out of space before I get to the turnips. Digging the turnips was done by the men on a Saturday morning. Turnips were carried to the storage shed where the sweet potatoes and white potatoes were stored.\nI still love a peeled turnip raw, cut into strips and dipped in ranch dressing.\nI love cooking year-round, but Sunday dinners, holiday cooking and pot luck meals are my favorite. Today I have a mixture of vegetables that are fall favorites for those upcoming dinners.\nWESTLINE ROAD COLLARD GREENS3 tbsp lard or shortening (divided), 1 large onion (chopped), 6 garlic cloves (minced), 1 1/2 pounds smoked ham hocks, 6 cups water, 2 tsp seasoned salt, 1 to 3 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp sugar, 1 large bunch collard greens ( coarsely chopped).\nIn a 6-qt. stockpot, heat 1 tbsp lard over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, cook and stir until tender. Add ham hocks, water, seasoned salt, pepper flakes, and sugar. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, until meat is tender, 55-60 minutes. Add collard greens and remaining lard. Return to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, until greens are very tender, 55-60 minutes. Remove meat from bones; finely chop and return to pan. Discard bones.\nMASHED TURNIPS3 pounds of turnips, 2 ½ cups water, 1 tsp salt, ¼ cup heavy cream, 2 tbsp butter, ½ cup of chopped bacon.\nPeel and chop turnips. Place in a pot and cover with equal parts milk and water with salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until soft, 20 to 25 minutes; drain. Puree with heavy cream and butter. Season with chopped bacon. Use a food processor or immersion blender to puree these veggies-they're too hard for a potato masher unless you need the workout.\nROASTED SWEET POTATOES2 pounds sweet potatoes (about 4 medium), 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, black pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees. Dice the sweet potatoes into 3/4-inch cubes, leaving the skin on. In a large bowl, mix together the sweet potatoes with the olive oil, garlic powder and salt. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the sweet potatoes on top in an even layer. Bake for about 25 minutes, until the cubes are tender and browned on the bottom. Serve warm. Store leftovers refrigerated. Make ahead instructions: Make up to 3 days in advance and reheat in a 350-degree oven.\nSWEET POTATO CASSEROLE6 large, sweet potatoes (peeled and cut into chunks), 1 cup white sugar, ½ cup brown sugar, 2 tbsp ground cinnamon, 1 tbsp butter (softened), 1 cup miniature marshmallows or as many as you'd like.\nPlace sweet potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes; drain. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees, grease a deep casserole dish. Mash potatoes with a potato masher in a bowl until no large lumps remain. Stir in both sugars, cinnamon, and butter until well combined, then transfer to the prepared casserole dish. Cover with a layer of miniature marshmallows. Bake in the preheated oven until marshmallows are browned, about 30 minutes.\nROASTED BEETS6 to 8 small or medium red beets, extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling, 1 large navel orange, balsamic vinegar for drizzling, juice of ½ lemon, handful of cooked collard greens, sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place each beet on a piece of foil and drizzle generously with olive oil and pinches of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Wrap the beets in the foil and roast on a baking sheet for 35 to 60 minutes, or until soft and fork-tender. The time will depend on the size and freshness of the beets. Remove the beets from the oven, remove the foil, and set aside to cool. When they are cool to the touch, peel the skins. I like to hold them under running water and slide the skins off with my hands. Use a citrus peeler to peel long strips around the orange, avoiding the white pith. Grated zest would work here also. Slice ¾ of the orange into segments and reserve the remaining ¼ wedge for squeezing. Slice the beets into 1-inch wedges or chunks and place them in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and vinegar, then add the lemon juice, orange juice squeezed from the remaining wedge, and a few pinches of salt and pepper and toss. Chill until ready to serve. Taste before serving and season with more salt (flaky sea salt, if using) and pepper or more vinegar (for more tang), orange, or lemon juice, as desired.\nSWEET POTATO SALAD3 large sweet potatoes (peeled and cubed), 1 small red onion (thinly sliced into half moons), 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, salt, freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/2 cup crumbled feta, 1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley. FOR DRESSING: 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp Dijon mustard, 1 tbsp honey, 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp ground paprika, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss sweet potatoes and red onion in oil then season with salt and pepper. Distribute them evenly on a sheet in a single layer. Bake until tender, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes then transfer to a large bowl. Meanwhile, make dressing: In a small bowl or in a medium liquid measuring cup, whisk together vinegar, mustard, honey, and spices. Gradually pour in oil, whisking constantly until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper. Toss sweet potatoes with dressing, cranberries, feta and parsley. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nSHREDDED BRUSSELS SPROUTS AND KALE SALAD1 pound brussels sprouts (trimmed, loose leaves removed and thinly shredded), 1 bunch kale (stems removed and leaves finely chopped into ribbons), 2 medium apples of your choice (cored and thinly sliced), 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/3 cup candied pecans (chopped), 1/4 cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese. FOR DRESSING: 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice, 1 garlic clove (minced), 1 tsp sugar (can sub honey or maple syrup), 1/8 tsp salt, fresh ground pepper to taste. OPTIONAL: 4 slices cooked turkey bacon (chopped).\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, sugar and salt. In a separate large bowl, toss together shredded brussels sprouts and kale mixture with your hands. Slowly pour in dressing and use your hands to massage the kale and brussels sprouts for about 5 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour or up to overnight to allow for dressing to soak into the kale and Brussels. Once ready to serve, toss in apple slices, dried cranberries and chopped candied pecans. If you'd like you can add in chopped bacon at this point and toss salad again. Finally, garnish with crumbled gorgonzola. Serve immediately. Season with freshly ground black pepper.\nCABBAGE ROLLS1 head green cabbage, 1 cup uncooked rice, 1 pound ground pork, ½ pound ground beef, 2 small onions (diced), 3 cloves garlic (minced), ½ tsp dill weed, 3 tbsp fresh parsley (chopped), salt and pepper to taste, 1 can diced tomatoes (14 ounces) with juices, 1 egg, 1 ½ cups + ⅓ cup tomato sauce (divided), 1 can tomato soup.\nBoil cabbage leaves for about 2 minutes or until soft. (See note below for removing leaves). Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cook rice according to package directions but reduce cooking time by 5 minutes so the rice is slightly underdone. Set aside. Cook pork, beef, onions, garlic and seasonings in a pan until no pink remains. Drain any fat. Add in rice, diced tomatoes and ⅓ cup of tomato sauce. Stir in egg. Mix remaining tomato sauce and tomato soup in a bowl. Spread a very thin layer of the tomato sauce mixture in a 9-by-13-inch pan. Remove or thin and thick stem on cabbage leaves. Lay the cabbage leaf flat and add ¼ to 1/3 cup filling to the center of the leaf. Fold in the sides and roll the cabbage up. Place seam side down in the pan. Repeat with remaining cabbage. Pour sauce over the cabbage and cover tightly with foil. Bake for 75-90 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes before serving. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Grains and oilseeds are also the most common type of farm, according to the census.\nThe US Department of Agriculture did not do much census reporting about agritourism until 2017, Burkholder said.\nVisitor spending in the county is strong and sites that draw an amount of tourists are primarily waterfront and officials are seeking to connect attractions and agritourism.\n\"Tourism is in a good place in Queen Anne's County,\" she said.\nAn important focus of the study also looked at local wineries, craft breweries and distilleries and what can be done to expand production and events.\nThe study looked at counties of Frederick, Carroll and Worcester, where agritourism is a large established focus.\nSome initiatives of the plan include establishing definitions of agritourism and reflecting trends such as farm to table dinners in zoning subdivision regulation codes, Burkholder said.\nThe agritourism study is still ongoing and a final report is expected to be presented at a later date.\nMore information about the Maryland Extension can be found at extension.umd.edu/home. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County Christmas tree farm perseveres through drought\n\n December 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 860\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — The Cawley Family Farm has been in operation since 1996. It has never seen a season in which the heat killed as many Christmas trees as it did this year.Owner and operator Charlie Cawley, his business and his family are overcoming one of the worst droughts in recent memory. Around 300 mature trees across 15 acres were lost this year. Many of them have visibly brown needles, showing damage from the summer's heat.\n\"I've never lost mature trees like this,\" Cawley said.\nTo add insult to injury, Cawley said, the heat took out around 1,700 new seedlings, even those on drip irrigation. Those losses will have a longer-term impact.\n\"Seven, eight years from now, I could run into a problem,\" Cawley said, \"unless I can pick it back up.\"\nHowever, the family farm isn't going anywhere as the Christmas season nears. In fact, it's full steam ahead for the Cawley Family Farm, welcoming customers as one of the few full-tilt Christmas tree farms in the region.\nOVERCOMING DROUGHTLocated just west of Denton and the Choptank River, Cawley Family Farm is a go-to for Caroline County residents and people up and down the Eastern Shore looking for a Christmas tree.\nWhile this year's drought is certainly going to take a financial toll on the farm, there's no indication of it for customers picking out a tree. The Cawleys opened for tree sales in November and will continue through the weekends leading up to Christmas.\nThe heat wave — which saw extended bouts of triple-digit temperatures that \"fried\" many trees — is just a part of farming, Charlie Cawley said.\n\"Sooner or later, you're going to hit one of these,\" he said. \"It's bound to happen.\"\nThe heat didn't affect trees in just one specific area; instead, damaged trees are fairly spread out across the farm. Cawley said they're working with a pathologist to look at some of the affected ones.\nThe enormous loss of seedlings, though, will have an effect for years to come. The longtime farmer said accounting for this year's deficit will be as simple as planting more than normal moving forward.\n\"You got to plant extra, that's all,\" Cawley said. \"To answer your question, we just got to plant 10%, 20% extra.\"\nA variety of trees, from Canaan, to Douglas, to Concolor firs, will still be available to customers this holiday season. The operation includes pre-cut Fraser fir trees, an entire process itself inside of a building on the farm. Fraser firs are especially popular and in demand, Cawley said, since they can't be grown due to the soil.\nHe added that people have come from as far as Princess Anne to get a tree. The Cawleys provided especially large trees for the Town of Denton this year and the Town of Berlin in the past.\nCharlie and his daughter, Amy, an integral part of managing the Denton farm, recognize the importance of creating an experience for families and kids. Parents are not just picking out their trees, but children are taking photos, running around outside and learning about a real farm.\n\"The best part is about to happen this weekend when the families come, and we put a smile on their face with their tree,\" said Amy Cawley.\n'A 12-YEAR DEAL'Families in the area have limited options for farms where they can cut their own trees. The Cawley farm is the only listed member of the Maryland Christmas Tree Farm Association located in Caroline, Dorchester or Talbot counties.\nJoncie Underwood, the national director for the state association and a vice president of the National Christmas Tree Association, said the soil in the area limits Christmas tree farmers.\n\"On the Shore, I would say it's always been one here and there,\" said Underwood, who works at her family's Pine Valley Christmas Trees farm in Elkton, \"primarily because of the soil. It's not easy to grow trees on sandy soil.\"\nUnderwood added that profitability is possible, but it largely depends on the soil and having a large, reliable customer base nearby. Charlie Cawley said while he isn't losing money, profit is certainly not the reason why he does the job.\n\"There's just nobody doing it any more,\" Cawley said. \"It's not that financially profitable. I'm making money, some money.\"\n\"There's a lot of work to a tree,\" he continued. \"A lot of people don't understand that. That's a 12-year deal. It took me … about eight, 10 years to realize you weren't going to make much money.\"\nInstead, Cawley emphasized the chance to pass down the farming tradition to his children and grandchildren. It's a \"family affair,\" he said, with he and his wife managing the operation, their two sons and one daughter pitching in, the grandkids chipping in to make wreaths, and the two family dogs greeting customers as they arrive.\nThe combination of the job's hard but rewarding work, along with that family involvement, is why Charlie Cawley has stuck to being a Christmas tree farmer.\n\"It grows on you. Just like a tree grows on you, the business grows on you,\" Cawley said. \"The smell of the tree kind of hooked me back in the beginning.\n\"I farm, I like to see things grow. It's kind of neat that my grandkids are here helping. It's a family deal.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'Fascinating' sika deer thrive in Dorchester County but cause concerns for farmers\n\n December 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 890\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DORCHESTER COUNTY — In the wetlands of the Eastern Shore, thousands of sika deer have acclimated to the region's climate since the 1900s. While the species offers a sense of local pride and peculiarity, many local farmers hold frustrations with sika's impact on crops.Sika deer are native to Japan and a highly sought species, with most of the state's population located in Dorchester County.\nThe Maryland Department of Natural Resources doesn't consider the species invasive, but rather exotic.\nJonathan Trudeau, who works in the Department of Natural Resources' Wildlife & Heritage Service, describes sika as an \"elusive\" species that are popular with both hunters and the general public.\n\"It's a unique species. It's a unique opportunity,\" said Trudeau, who is the service's game and mammal section leader. \"It's essentially the East Coast equivalent of going on an elk hunt. It's something that not a lot of people get to do. It's a challenging hunt.\"\nFarmers in Dorchester County, however, have voiced their concerns over the sika population, particularly in recent years. Trudeau said sika contribute more to crop damage in the county than white-tailed deer.\nTodd Eberspacher, a fifth-generation farmer in Linkwood, said the issue has been \"out of control\" over the last 10 to 15 years. He and his father grow corn, wheat and soybeans.\n\"We've been in this area a long time,\" Eberspacher said. \"My father and I have seen deer damage. Deer damage was an issue as long as I can remember, but not to the extent as what it is now.\"\nCROP CONCERNSEberspacher recalls a time when his neighbor \"had around $70,000 worth of damage she lost on one of her farms\" due to sika deer eating the crops. He says while white-tailed deer graze on crops, it's \"not nearly to the extent of sika deer.\"\nThe Wildlife & Heritage Service offers deer management permits for agricultural producers in order to mitigate crop damage, even outside of typical hunting seasons.\nEberspacher, however, said the permits don't solve the crux of the problem, which comes at night.\nAccording to Trudeau, sika deer prefer wetlands and marshy areas during the day, but dry land and agricultural areas at night. The nocturnal nature of the deer is what has hurt the Eberspachers.\n\"Something that farmers need are nighttime permits,\" Eberspacher said. \"We're issued crop damage permits, but they're only valid and you're only able to use them from … a half-hour prior to sunrise and a half-hour after sunset.\"\nEberspacher added that this year's rise in the cost for an out-of-state license to hunt sika, from $25 to $200, has only worsened the crop damage stemming from the species. While the Department of Natural Resources enforces those costs, changes came from legislators at the state level, not the department nor its Wildlife & Heritage Service.\n\"The state's got our hands tied,\" Eberspacher said. \"We're not able to address the issue.\"\nTrudeau says hunters do make an annual impact on the sika deer population. In a report released by the Department of Natural Resources Friday, 961 sika deer were harvested in Dorchester County during the recent two-week firearms season.\nConversations with state officials haven't led to any solutions so far, Eberspacher says.\n\"The state of Maryland sees sika deer as a chance to bring revenue to the state,\" he said. \"They don't care about the farmers. We've met with different legislators, they've (come) out, they've looked at the fields at nighttime, they've seen the several deer. And then it goes nowhere.\"\n'FASCINATING' SPECIESAs the farming community seeks relief for crops, many others are amazed by the uniqueness of sika deer and how the species has neatly fit into Maryland's Eastern Shore.\n\"We get a lot of questions about it,\" Trudeau said. \"We have a lot of stakeholders who are very interested in the species, whether it be for hunting purposes, if they're an ag producer or even just the general public that finds it fascinating.\"\nBrought to the region by a wealthy resident in the early 1900s, the sika deer population modestly grew from a count that started in the single digits. Despite slow growth, the numbers soared by the 1990s, Trudeau says.\nThe population size is well off, with an estimated 19,000 across the state. Sika deer are prized possessions for hunters — some even travel from the other end of the country, Trudeau said.\n\"Today, it's a very, very popular game species,\" he said. \"And to be honest, it drives some of the economics in that area, especially during the hunting season.\"\nTrudeau notes that compared to white-tailed deer, sika deer are smaller and rounder in size, standing at only a few feet tall. They also have a darker coat than white-tailed deer.\nThe two-week firearms report shows the 961 sika deer harvested in Dorchester County outpace 905 white-tailed deer. But the two deer species don't negatively compete with one another, according to Trudeau.\nWetlands areas are \"subpar\" habitats for white-tailed deer, he said. Sika deer, meanwhile, create \"pockets\" in those wetlands, though overlapping with the white-tailed deer on the outer edges.\nSince sika deer typically don't have twins or reproduce as much as white-tailed deer, Trudeau says Maryland's healthy sika deer population is something to truly appreciate.\n\"Maryland's really one of the only places that you can find this species free range outside of its native range,\" Trudeau said. \"So it's a very, very unique species, and it's very unique that we have a population that is actually doing very, very well.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system.\nConfirmation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory is pending with final results anticipated in the coming days.\n\"High Pathogenic Avian influenza or HPAI does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain healthy and safe to eat and handle,\" said Maryland Department of Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks. \"The Maryland Department of Agriculture, local health department, USDA and partner organizations are working diligently to address the situation, including quarantining and testing nearby flocks. We continue to urge commercial growers and backyard flock owners to be on heightened alert for HPAI.\"\nAvian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure.\nThe virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers, the MDA said. This virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds and raptors.\nIn an interview with The Star Democrat, Delmarva Chicken Association Communications Manager James Fisher said this incident reinforces how important it is that families and farmers raising chickens keep biosecurity practices at the top of mind \"at all times.\"\nFisher said the association has shared \"important biosecurity advice\" with members and made sure that members are aware of federal and state agriculture resources regarding planning farms and setting biosecurity practices in place.\n\"We also have a text alert service for our members so we can let them know as soon as a detection has been announced by agriculture officials,\" he said. \"And we've put that in practice with the recent detections.\"\nAccording to the Maryland Department of Health, the risk of transmission of the disease between birds and the general public is low. Those who work directly with poultry or dairy farms may be more at risk and should follow key biosecurity practices.\nThe Maryland Department of Agriculture recommends the following steps if HPAI is suspected on personal property, in wild birds or in a commercial operation:Look for signs of illness. Know the warning signs of infectious bird diseases.\nReport suspected sick birds at 410-841-5810.Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov.Key biosecurity practices:Clean and disinfect transportation. Don't walk through or drive trucks, tractors, or equipment in areas where waterfowl or other wildlife feces may be. If you can't avoid this, clean your shoes, vehicle, and equipment thoroughly.Remove loose feed. Don't give wild birds, rodents and insects a free lunch. Remove spilled or uneaten feed right away, and make sure feed storage units are secure and free of holes.Keep visitors to a minimum. Only allow those people who take care of your poultry to come in contact with your birds.Wash your hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry. Wash with soap and water. If using a hand sanitizer, first remove manure, feathers and other materials from your hands because disinfectants will not penetrate organic matter or caked-on dirt.Provide disposable boot covers (preferred) and/or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock. If using a footbath, be sure to remove all droppings, mud or debris from boots and shoes using a long-handled scrub brush before stepping into the disinfectant footbath, and always keep it clean.Change clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property.Visitors should wear protective outer garments or disposable coveralls, boots and headgear when handling birds, and shower or change clothes when leaving the facility.Clean and disinfect tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility. Before allowing vehicles, trucks, tractors, or tools and equipment — including egg flats and cases that have come in contact with birds or their droppings — to exit the property, make sure they are cleaned and disinfected to prevent contaminated equipment from transporting disease. Do not move or reuse items that cannot be cleaned and disinfected.For more information on avian influenza, visit mda.maryland.gov/Pages/AvianFlu.aspx. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Fresh pork on the farm\n\n January 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Life \n \n 1716\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A couple of years ago I did a story and recipes about the annual hog slaughtering adventures on the farm and decided to re-run this as one of my favorite memories to share with my readers.As a matter of fact, just a few weeks ago I was asked if I was going to do one this winter — here it is, my friend.\nThis part of farm life, hog slaughtering, is a dying process as not many of the older farmers are even on farms any more and the younger generation prefers to concentrate on more modern aspects of farming, such as specialty vegetables, fruit trees, pick-your-own and more.\nEach year my parents held an two old-fashioned hog killings to fill the smokehouse and freezers with meat, once in November and once in March.\nThis supply of meat fit perfectly with the previous summer's canned vegetables, jellies, relishes, applesauce and much more, not to mention the shed with potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions and turnips.\nIt was not a lot of hard work because we all pitched in and my dad had several farm hands helping. Everybody left at the end of the day with full stomachs and a package of sausage, scrapple or seasoning meat.\nToday as I ride past the old farm place I get upset looking at and thinking of those days gone by. I can still see the late Mr. Jim Showell ready to hang the meat and the late Mr. Ed Sturgis ready to hang the iron pots over the fire he would make.\nMom would allow her children and grandchildren to \"help\" with the work, but she had a hand in it all — especially the final taste testing of the sausage and scrapple.\nThe morning of the slaughter found my sister and I scrubbing down the cutting services, the mixing utensils, the pans to hold scrapple and the trays for both loose sausage and link sausage. In the smokehouse waited the exceptionally clean, sharp meat hooks to hang the hams and shoulders. Finally, there were the cans to hold the fresh pressed lard.\nThe one job that my mother had every year was sausage maker. Either one of my brothers or nephews would feed the cut-up pork parts into the top of the grinder. My mother sat stretching sheep's intestines for the casing over the tube and working the ground sausage as it fed into the intestines and into a large bowl. This was a job that I later inherited, and since it was the only job that you could actually sit at our hog killings, I didn't mind.\nThere are many funny stories associated with \"hog killing adventures\" throughout the years but time will not allow today. In the next few winter months, I will slip them in.\nThe one I love the most was when the hogs could have gotten me in big trouble but my bus driver, the late Mr. George Hudson, was related to mom, and he was a farmer.\nOne cold hog killing morning, I was leaving to go to school on the bus, and I begged Mr. Sturgis to cut out the hog brains for my class to study in biology. He did, but he put them in a small brown paper bag.\nBy the time we got to Stephen Decatur High School the bag broke through as we got off the bus. My friend Nellie saw it first, screamed, hollered \"dead,\" and everyone ran. I tried to explain to our new principal but to no avail. He just didn't understand a country girl's ambition to succeed in biology.\nLet's cook some delicious fresh pork.\nCOUNTRY PORK RIBS3 pounds country style pork ribs (about 8 ribs), 2 tsps smoked salt, ½ tsp black pepper, 2 tsps smoked paprika, 1 tsp dried thyme, ½ tsp cayenne pepper.\nPreheat your oven to 325 degrees. Arrange the ribs in a single layer in an ungreased 9-by-13-inch rimmed baking dish. Mix together the dry rub ingredients and sprinkle the rub on top of the ribs. Cover the baking dish tightly with heavy duty foil (or a double layer of regular foil), and bake until the ribs are very tender, about 2 hours. With a slotted spatula, remove the cooked ribs to a broiler-safe, foil-lined, rimmed baking sheet. Either flip them or place them on their side, so that the fat is exposed to the heating element. The goal is to brown it. Switch the oven to broil on high ( 500°F) and set an oven rack 6 inches below the heating element (not directly below).Baste the ribs with the pan juices, then broil them until the fat is browned, 3-4 minutes. Baste the ribs one more time with the pan juices and serve.\nPORK ROAST6-pound boneless pork shoulder, 3 cloves garlic (minced), 2 tsps salt, 2 tsps ground pepper, 1 tbsp chopped fresh sage, 1 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary, 2 large red onions (sliced into 1-inch wedges), olive oil, 1/2 cup reserved pan drippings.\nOne day before you plan to serve the roast, preheat oven to 300 degrees. Tie roast well with kitchen twine. Rub roast with mix of herbs and garlic and place in oiled roasting pan, Bake in preheated oven, uncovered, for 3 hours. Remove roast from pan and add onions; toss with pan drippings (if there isn't enough fat in the pan, drizzle with a bit of olive oil and toss onions to coat). Place roast on top of onions and return to oven, uncovered, for an additional 4 hours (check pan every hour to be sure the pan drippings don't evaporate — add 2 cups of water if necessary). Remove the roast from the roasting pan and place it in a glass baking dish and allow it to cool before you wrap the dish well with plastic and put it in the fridge overnight. Reserve the onions and pan drippings separately in the fridge overnight too. You should have about 1 1/2 cups of drippings (maybe 1 1/4 after you remove the fat). Add water to the drippings if you don't have enough.\nAbout an hour before you want to serve this yummy roast, preheat your oven to 300 degrees. Remove the twine from the roast and slice into 1/4-inch slices, \"Shingle\" the slices in a large casserole dish. Pour about 1/2 cup of the reserved pan drippings over the slices, cover with foil, and place in preheated oven for 45 minutes, Season individual servings and serve.\nPORK LOIN CHOPSPork loin chop, 2 tbsp paprika, 1 tbsp salt, ½ tbsp ground black pepper, ½ tbsp garlic powder, ½ tbsp onion powder, 1 tsp dry mustard powder, 1 tsp ground sage, ¼ tsp cayenne pepper, ¼ tsp celery salt.\nMeasure out all of the dry ingredients into a small mixing bowl (or the bowl of a spice grinder). Set aside. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees and lightly grease or spray a baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Wash and trim your country style pork loin chops as needed, then pat the pork dry using paper towels. Apply the pork seasoning to all sides of the pork chops generously. For about 2 lbs of country style pork loin chops you'd use 2 tbsps of the pork seasoning. Place the seasoned country style pork loin chops into your prepared baking dish in a single layer. Bake in the middle of your oven's center rack for 35-40 minutes, or until the pork reaches a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees. Remove from the oven and serve immediately for best taste.\nPULLED PORK1 3-pound pork shoulder roast, ½ cup beef broth, ⅓ cup apple cider vinegar, ½ chopped yellow onion, 2 tbsps light brown sugar, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tbsp yellow mustard, 1 bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce.\nSpread chopped onions on the bottom of the slow cooker. Add pork shoulder and pour in chicken broth, Worcestershire and cider vinegar right on the pork. Add mustard and brown sugar and use your hands to rub it all in the pork. Cover the slow cooker and set on high for 5 hours. Shred pork with 2 forks and pour in BBQ sauce. Don't pour the whole bottle in, just enough to cover the meat according to taste. Cover and cook on high for 1 more hour. Serve on your favorite sandwich rolls or buns.\nBACON, BEAN AND POTATO SOUP1 pound dry navy beans, 6 oz bacon, 2 cloves garlic, 1 yellow onion, 3 carrots, 3 ribs celery, 2 pounds potatoes, 6 cups chicken broth, 1 8-oz can tomato sauce, salt and pepper to taste.\nThe day before you want to serve, place the beans in a large bowl and add enough cool water to cover the beans by 2-3 inches. Let the beans soak in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, cut the bacon into one-inch pieces. Cook the bacon in a large pot over medium heat until brown and crispy. Remove the bacon to a paper towel lined plate and pour off most of the grease, leaving a tbsp or two in the pot. While the bacon is cooking, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Peel and slice the carrots and slice the celery. Sauté the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery in the leftover bacon grease over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent (about five minutes). Use the moisture from the vegetables to help dissolve the browned bits of bacon from the bottom of the pot. While the vegetables are sautéing, peel the potatoes then cut them into half-inch cubes. Drain the soaked beans in a colander and rinse them briefly. Add the cubed potatoes, rinsed beans and chicken broth to the pot. Cover the pot and bring it up to a boil. Reduce the heat slightly and let the pot boil gently for one hour, or until the beans and potatoes are very soft. Use an immersion blender to purée about half of the soup, leaving some beans and vegetables whole. If you don't have an immersion blender, remove half of the soup from the pot, let it cool slightly, then use a blender or food processor to carefully puree the warm soup. Return the puréed soup to the pot and stir to combine with the rest. Add the tomato sauce and reserved bacon to the soup. Stir and heat until warm. Taste the soup and add salt and pepper if needed. Serve hot. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Containing this problem and not letting it spread is key to maintaining those numbers.\n\"So while a handful of farms affected by this doesn't immediately alter those numbers very much, we all don't want to see a situation in which we have dozens of farms affected,\" said James Fisher, communications manager for Delmarva Chicken Association.\nState laboratory tests detected a case of avian influenza in Queen Anne's County on Tuesday, the fourth case found in a commercial operation on the Delmarva Peninsula since Jan. 3. The disease was discovered at a commercial operation in Caroline County on Jan. 10, which was the first documented case in a commercial operation in Maryland this year.\nHealth and agriculture authorities have put measures in place aiming to curb the spread of the disease, which at this time is believed to have only infected birds.\n\"State officials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties are being or have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system,\" the Maryland Department of Agriculture said in a press release about the case in Queen Anne's County.\nAt Tuesday's Caroline County Commissioners meeting, Caroline County Health officer Robin Cahall offered an update on the disease.\nAmong the main concerns at the Tuesday meeting were the financial trouble the bird flu could bring and the compensation for farmers who lose their flocks.\nFederal programs are in place to aid farmers who lose flocks to avian flu.\n\"The USDA, actually operates a sort of a backstop income program for cases like this,\" Fisher said, \"because you don't want to have a situation which farmers fear reporting signs of HPAI out of the fear of lost income.\"\nHUMAN HEALTH IMPACTSAt this time, chances for human-to-human transmission of the disease are low, health authorities say.\nAt the Tuesday meeting, Caroline County officials detailed steps they are taking to track potential mutations that could impact human health.\n\"So human-to-human transmission is not occurring at this time. The threat to humans is low,\" Cahall said. \"... However, if the virus mutates that could present a problem.\"\nThe Caroline County residents with exposure to the bird flu are monitored for flu-like symptoms, and they will be tested for the disease if symptoms arise. Authorities are securing the locations where the disease is found to make sure no one comes into contact with the quarantined area.\nHunters and birders are safe to operate, but they need to take some precautions while participating in the activity, state officials warn.\nAccording to Maryland Department of Natural Resources, people should never harvest or handle wild birds that are sick or found dead.\nWashing hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer immediately after handling animals and using disposable gloves when handling animals and double-bagging animals are encouraged.\nFor preparation purposes, officials urge people to cook wild-caught animals to 165 degrees to kill any viruses or bacteria. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland, Delaware officials hold session to discuss solutions for spreading avian flu\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 804\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In Delaware, farmers have seen birds fall out the sky — a troubling sign for the spread of the avian flu, Delaware Secretary of Agriculture Michael Scuse said in a Zoom meeting Friday.Multiple Maryland and Delaware officials hosted a situational update on the disease for poultry farmers on Jan. 17. The bird flu epidemic in the area, which began in the last few weeks, is spreading mainly through wild flocks, they said.\n\"The issue for our farms really involves the fact that the snow geese that didn't die overnight while roosting on the coast are strong enough to fly,\" Scuse said. \"These birds will move inland to forage on open spaces, including our farm fields, many of them right next to poultry houses. We've heard from you that you're seeing birds drop dead right out of the sky, it puts your birds and your whole farming operation's livelihood at risk. It also affects the entire industry.\"\nThe meeting offered information on the bird flu and gave farmers in the Delmarva area a chance to ask questions on what they should do to help curb the disease's spread.\nHow the bird flu spreadsThe bird flu can spread from multiple different sources besides just dead birds, the officials said. H5N1, the strain of avian influenza in question, can be transmitted from clothing, shoes, equipment and vehicles.\n\"If a snow goose has its waste, and you walk through it, you could carry it right into the house,\" Scuse said. \"A dime's worth of droppings carrying HPAI on your shoes would be enough to kill one million birds. Airborne transmission is not likely, but it may occur\"\nAnother way the bird flu can be spread is through household animals like dogs or cats. Although cases in dogs are rare, officials said cats are highly susceptible to the disease.\nFarm cats are susceptible because of consuming unpasteurized milk, and all cats are susceptible by consuming raw pet food.\nLetting your dog or cat walk in areas wild birds leave droppings in is very dangerous because they can contract bird flu from sick wildlife.\nHuman contact as a spreading agent for the disease has not been reported in either Maryland or Delaware, and officials believe that human transfer is a low possibility.\nAlthough its unlikely for humans to get this strain of the bird flu at this time, humans can spread the disease to animals by not cleaning materials used for farming.\nCases in Maryland and DelawareAt this time, Delaware has seen the most cases of bird flu in the Delmarva area.\n\"By January 3, more than 850 wild birds had been reported dead in Delaware, with the majority being snow geese, but also Canada geese, other water fowl, vultures and other birds.\" Scuse said.\nMaryland has seen some cases on the Eastern Shore area as well.\n\"We tested some snow geese in Dorchester County that came up positive, and also in Worcester County that came up positive,\" Jennifer Trout, a veterinarian from MDA stated. \"After that, we had our first case in Caroline County on the 10th of January, a broiler farm that did have some high mortality, and they were 51-day-old birds.\n\"Our next case occurred on the 14th in Queen Anne's County —high mortality there as well, 60-day-old birds. And then the final case was on the 15th, another case in Caroline County, another broiler farm. Those birds were 58 days old as well. There was no mortality there. And then also this week, we had some positive vultures in Queen Anne's County.\"\nHow to dispose and keep from spreadingOfficials recommend disposing of dead wildlife by setting up a stock pile away from well chickens. They also say to make sure the stock pile is covered and away from wildlife.\n\"If you're stockpiling on the farm, if you have manure storage availability, in a manure storage structure, that's the preferred place to store litter if you have capacity,\" said Steve Connelly, deputy secretary of the Maryland Department of Agriculture. \"If you don't have capacity, you can stockpile it, but please cover it. We're really concerned about the wildlife effect.\"\nMaryland and Delaware officials urge farmers to clean the bottom of their shoes, as well as the floors of vehicles, with Lysol so they won't transmit the bird flu between flocks.\nKevin Sullivan, state director for USDA wildlife services for Maryland, Delaware and D.C., offered multiple solutions to scare wild animals away from healthy flocks without touching them.\n\"You can do whatever you want to haze and harass the birds, snow geese, geese, vultures, you don't need a permit to do that,\" Sullivan said. \"If you see them in your field by the hundreds or the thousands, I would not let them congregate there. You have to assume that they're sick. Chase them with a vehicle, a dog noise maker, firearms, but all options out there, don't let them sit on your manure sheds.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It can be spread in multiple ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.\nThe virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds and raptors.\nAccording to the Maryland Department of Health, the risk of transmission between birds and the general public is low. Those who work directly with poultry or dairy farms may be more at risk and should follow key biosecurity practices.\nThe Maryland Department of Agriculture continues to urge growers and backyard flock owners to enhance biosecurity practices and become familiar with what to do if avian influenza is suspected in a flock.\nGrowers and backyard flock owners should be on the lookout for signs of illness and report suspected sick birds. To report a possible case in a commercial or backyard flock, call the Maryland Department of Agriculture at 410-841-5810. Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov.\nTo report a sick wild bird in Maryland, call the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Services hotline at 877-463-6497 between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.\nKey biosecurity practices include:\nCleaning and disinfecting transportation.\nRemoving loose feed.\nKeeping visitors to a minimum.\nWashing hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry.\nProviding disposable boot covers (preferred) and/or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock.\nChanging clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property.\nHaving visitors wear protective outer garments or disposable coveralls, boots, and headgear when handling birds, and shower and/or change clothes when leaving the facility.\nCleaning and disinfecting tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility.\nFor more information on avian influenza, visit: mda.maryland.gov/Pages/AvianFlu.aspx. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "There are other options open to poultry farmers\n\n January 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DR. ASHA SUBRAMANIAN | Section: News \n \n 726\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As a physician, I have been following closely our country's bird flu crisis. I was saddened but not surprised to learn that, within days of each other, bird flu was detected for the first time on an Eastern Shore poultry farm and our country experienced the death of its first patient from H5N1 bird flu in Louisiana.My colleagues and I are watchful for symptoms of bird flu and are hopeful that Maryland does not join the list of states in which more than 60 human cases of bird flu have been detected. I applaud our public health officials for doing what they can to keep the bird flu from spreading but the reality is that the virus has sickened dozens of people, decimated poultry populations and infected dairy cows.\nThankfully, our state is doing a good job of monitoring for the virus. But now is the time to take a hard look at the food production system that puts farm workers in close contact with sick birds and cows, the Standard American Diet that demands it and the health ramifications of both.\nFrom a doctor's perspective, shifting food production away from intensive animal agriculture can benefit public health. Facilities with large numbers of animals in a small amount of space are a concern for public health because they provide ideal conditions for viruses to spread, evolve and possibly acquire the ability to more easily infect people. Intensive animal agriculture was implicated when influenza viruses H1N1, H5N1 and N7N9 jumped from animals to people, according to research published in Frontiers in Microbiology.\nThe life of a contract chicken grower can be challenging, and some of them are repurposing their chicken houses to grow crops. I was not surprised to learn that North Carolina poultry farmers Dale and Paula Boles switched from chickens, converted their 500-foot-long poultry barn to a greenhouse and now grow organic vegetables. They are not alone. In Southwest Arkansas, farmers Jennifer and Rodney Barrett are transitioning from raising poultry and cattle to growing mushrooms.\nThese farm transitions aren't easy. The government should provide financial and technical support. Maryland could help its farmers with a program like the one established by lawmakers in Vermont who provide grants to farmers who wish to diversify or transition from one type of farming to another. On a broader scale, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker has introduced legislation that would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide grants to livestock farmers to pay off related debt and to transition the property to alternative agriculture activities. Maryland's U.S. Sens. Van Hollen and Alsobrooks should support this legislation to help ensure that it passes.\nAccording to the USDA, \"Maryland is small, but it reaches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Appalachian Mountains, providing a suitable environment for a variety of agricultural commodities,\" which means lots of opportunities for farmers. Sweet corn, hazelnuts, watermelons, grapes, as well as apple, cherry and peach orchards are just a few promising options.\nShifting away from animal agriculture helps our environment and improves worker safety as well. Maryland's poultry farms are a primary source of water, air and land pollution. Improving the water quality in the Chesapeake Bay is another reason to increase acreage of fruit and nut trees. One way to keep phosphorous and other pollutants from flowing into rivers is to install riparian buffers of trees and shrubs to intercept polluted water running off of fields where chicken litter has been applied. Trees that are suitable for riparian buffers, like hazelnuts can also provide income to farmers.\nI have found for myself and my patients that removing animal products from the diet improves health too. A plant-based diet focused on fruits, veggies, legumes and grains grown in Maryland can help maintain healthy weight, lower blood pressure and improve heart health.\nI know this from my own personal experience and from treating patients with diet-related diseases, and the scientific literature tells the same story. A recent study with 22 pairs of identical twins found that a plant-based diet improves heart health in as little as eight weeks. The twins following a plant-based diet experienced lower LDL, or \"bad\" cholesterol, and they lost more weight than the omnivore twins.\nGovernment grants and other assistance should also be available if Maryland poultry farmers or egg producers would like to switch to growing crops and planting orchards, which will also benefit human health and the environment. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) spoke to the state legislators on his excitement for the Trump administration that was sworn in on Monday and the changes that will be made to government spending now that Tesla CEO Elon Musk will co-lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.\n\"I do believe that we have to operate more, and the federal government has to operate more like the private sector does,\" Harris said. \"...Elon Musk is going to do in terms of promoting government efficiency because in the end we cannot continue trillion dollar deficits into the future. We have to control federal spending. We are cursed with without a balanced budget amendment.\"\nSeveral Republican delegation members at the meeting echoed these sentiments.\nMany spoke on the state of Maryland and the amount of federal employees it has, some saying the state is too heavily dependent on federal employment.\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said recent actions of some state officials in response to actions taken by the Trump administration do not align with Maryland's needs. He said the state is \"trying to find $3 billion\" and yet is involved in lawsuits against the federal government.\n\"The (Maryland) attorney general seems to have plenty of money to want to sue the federal government,\" Hutchinson said. \"Well, at the same time, the state has their hand out to the federal government saying, 'I need money for the Key Bridge. I need more Medicaid money.'\"\nPRIORITIES FOR FARMERSThroughout the meeting, several representatives and supporters of farmers and agriculture policy spoke, including Tyler Hough, director of government relations for the Maryland Farm Bureau, who shared priorities for the organization for the next fiscal year.\nHough said the bureau has three policy priorities, including private property rights and eminent domain, solar energy, and agriculture education. In his presentation, he focused on the importance of education for the state.\n\"The opportunity to educate the youth, even get into the middle school areas, the opportunity to have education in the high schools and the FFA (agriculture education) programs and the value that FFA brings along with the 4-H programs that already exist, is just fantastic for these students,\" Hough said.\nLater on the agenda, a presentation was made by members of the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology, an organization centering scientific research, policy analysis and outreach and education efforts.\nKate Everts, executive director of the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology, led the in-depth presentation, in which she highlighted the Maryland Climate-Smart Agriculture Project and the extensive outreach to Eastern Shore farmers that the center has done.\nEverts said the farm-centered project seeks to find what agriculture needs to be adaptable and profitable for a future dictated by climate change.\n\"We're seeing changes in weather across the country, but here in Maryland,\" Everts said, \"how is it impacting our farms and our forests? And again, we want to make sure that they are in a good position to stay economically viable going forward. So we're all about making sure their businesses are successful.\"\nEverts said the research team evaluated potential impacts on local agriculture and conducted outreach with farmers and service providers.\nToward the end of the presentation, Harris shared his appreciation for the work that the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology does for farmers and the importance of keeping them in the forefront of policy and work done for the state.\n\"It's very good to hear this presentation today because so often what happens in Annapolis is we go up with a lot of emotion, a lot of heart to represent and protect the interests of Agriculture, and what you're talking about, along with other institutions, is bringing science to bear with the lens of the Eastern Shore and certainly throughout the state. The point is through the lens of agriculture, which is so important,\" Harris said.\nThe next meeting of the Eastern Shore Delegation will be held on Jan. 31 via Zoom. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland officials hustle to contain avian flu outbreak\n\n January 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Paul Kiefer Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 672\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Four flocks of chickens on Maryland's Eastern Shore have tested positive for the avian influenza virus, also known as avian flu, since early January.Maryland state agencies are now hurrying to contain the outbreak, the further spread of which could hobble one of the region's core industries and raise concerns about the virus' transfer to humans.\nMaryland Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Atticks appeared alongside other state health and agriculture officials before the state House Environment and Transportation Committee on Friday to brief lawmakers on the outbreak and the state's response.\n\"Poultry is king on the Eastern Shore,\" he told the Capital News Service before the hearing. An outbreak in this important Maryland industry could hit the economy well beyond the four commercial farms with positive cases, he added.\nWhile human health risks of the virus are low, said Deputy Secretary of Public Health Services Nilesh Kalyanaraman, \"a lot of the concern here is not just on the livestock and poultry side, but also on the potential for transmission — and potentially mutations — that can make this a pandemic.\"\nThe current outbreak is the largest in Maryland since 2022, when chickens on five farms across the state tested positive for the virus. Since past outbreaks, state agencies and the Delmarva Peninsula's poultry industry have adopted strict sanitation practices to prevent the virus's spread. But the close proximity of farms may undercut those precautions, expanding the number of farmers impacted by even a small outbreak.\nWild birds, including the geese that migrate over the Delmarva Peninsula, are primary carriers of the virus. Maryland's Department of Agriculture and other government partners have worked with farmers for more than a decade to limit exposure to the disease.\nWhen a chicken tests positive for the virus, farmers cull their entire flock and begin a decontamination process that can last well over a month. Meanwhile, growers nearby are temporarily barred from obtaining new chickens, cutting into their annual earnings. While the U.S. Department of Agriculture pays for decontamination and generally compensates the affected farmers, the department does not offer the same assistance to nearby farmers who lose income after an outbreak.\nMaryland State Veterinarian Dr. Jennifer Trout told lawmakers on Friday that some 223 poultry farms and backyard flocks were close enough to this month's outbreaks to be subject to additional inspections. She did not specify how many farms were within the three-kilometer \"infected zones.\"\nDr. Jonathan Moyle, a poultry specialist with the University of Maryland Extension's Lower Eastern Shore Research and Education Center in Salisbury, says the density of poultry farms in parts of the Eastern Shore can expand the impacts of an avian flu outbreak. \"Talking to some of the farmers in the past,\" he told CNS, \"some of the biggest stresses were, 'I got a disease on my farm, and Jim down the road can't get birds.' That stresses them because their friends are impacted.'\"\nBut Moyle argues that density is necessary for the region's poultry industry to operate efficiently. \"When this all started — the industry — it centered around feed mills and processing plants, right?\" he said. \"There's always been diminishing returns the farther out you get.\"\nIn 2023, Sens. Chris Coons (D-Delaware) and Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi) introduced a proposal to expand the USDA's compensation program to cover poultry growers within the control zones around viral outbreaks. Despite bipartisan backing, the proposal is currently trapped in gridlock on Capitol Hill surrounding the next iteration of the Farm Bill.\nWhile the current avian flu outbreak is not yet under control, Atticks told state lawmakers on Friday that his agency is collaborating closely with counterparts in Delaware and Virginia, as well as with the USDA, to avoid more serious economic consequences. \"We do move as one when we're dealing with this industry on the shore,\" he said.\nSo far, Deputy Secretary of Public Health Services Kalyanaraman added, none of the 67 recent cases of avian influenza across the country have been linked to human-to-human transmission. As a precaution, his agency is distributing personal protective equipment to farm workers and has stockpiled medications to treat the virus. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Landon Hawkins of Centreville achieved an extraordinary feat this January by reaching Junior Champion Row with three different entries.Fifteen-year-old Landon, a ninth-grade student at Faith Christian School in Sudlersville, attended the Northeast Poultry Congress Poultry Show in West Springfield, MA, this past weekend. This prestigious event is the third-largest poultry show in the country, attracting top competitors from across the nation. Martha Stewart was in attendance, adding to the prestige of the event.\nHis outstanding accomplishments included winning Junior Champion Waterfowl with a white call duck drake, Junior Reserve Champion Waterfowl with a gray call duck pullet, and Junior Champion Turkey with a Royal Palm Tom.\nLandon has been passionate about poultry for years. He started hatching chickens and turkeys four years ago, but his ambitions took flight when he decided to focus on building a foundation stock of high-quality bred Call Ducks.\nGetting a bird ready for competition requires months of preparation and conditioning to ensure it meets the American Standard of Perfection — the official guideline for judging in poultry exhibitions and county/state fairs.\nHis first win was at the county fair level where he won Champion Waterfowl at the Queen Anne's County Fair in August with one of his Call Ducks. This victory was just the beginning of his journey in competitive poultry showing.\nInspired by his grandmother, who shows Sebastopol geese, in American Poultry Association (APA) sanctioned shows across the region. Landon turned his focus to competing in sanctioned shows.\nWith careful attention to breeding, grooming, and conditioning, Landon began winning at various American Poultry shows in Virginia and New Jersey, proving that his birds were top-quality contenders.\nWith this success, he set his sights on an even bigger stage—the Northeast Poultry Congress in Massachusetts, one of the most competitive shows in the region.\nFor Landon, showing poultry is about more than just competition. He says his favorite aspects of showing include traveling to new destinations, meeting experienced poultry breeders and mentors, and the thrill of anticipating how the judge will score his birds. Each show is an opportunity to learn, grow, and connect with others who share his passion.\nBeyond the show ring, Landon and his grandmother are taking their dedication a step further. They are in the final stages of launching Hawkins Poultry, a specialized breeding program focusing on Call Ducks, Sebastopol Geese, and Royal Palm Turkeys. Their goal is \"to raise and exhibit top-quality birds while promoting these breeds to other enthusiasts and exhibitors.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Delmarva Chicken Association offers update on avian influenza\n\n February 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 462\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Delmarva Chicken Association offered an update with good news on avian influenza cases in the Maryland at the Eastern Shore Delegation meeting held via Zoom Friday.\"As of today, we actually have four control area releases that have occurred, with the fourth one occurring today in Queen Anne's County,\" Holly Porter, executive director of the Delmarva Chicken Association, said.\nThe 10-mile radiuses restricting movement of poultry and poultry products in areas where avian influenza was detected will be lifted as a result of the releases.\nAccording to Porter, the four control areas can go back to operating normally and can have new chickens brought to their farms.\nThe avian influenza was discovered at a commercial operation in Caroline County on Jan. 10, which was the first documented case in a commercial operation in Maryland this year.\nSeven commercial operations in the Delmarva region were confirmed to have avian influenza, including the four in Maryland, two in Kent County, Delaware, and one in Accomack County, Virginia.\nThe Delmarva Chicken Association emphasized these releases happened less than a month after the avian flu was detected in commercial operations on the Eastern Shore.\n\"One of the greatest concerns that you probably hear from growers is, 'how long am I going to be without birds?'\" Porter said. \"That's the question we get most of the time. And there have been rumors out there that it could be months and months. And as you can see, this really is not true, as long as certain steps occur, which so far they have been occurring.\"\nIn the Delmarva area, there have been cases where wild birds carry avian influenza and spread the disease to farm poultry.\nSen. Johnny Mautz R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico, wanted to see if there was a way that wildlife information can be passed to the farmers from the Department of Natural Resources or Department of Agricultural so the farmers can know to look out for wild birds.\n\"Now that we have this avian influenza in the wild, particularly for our farmers, they need to know if there's a wild flock of birds within a half mile that have been detected with avian influenza,\" Mautz said.\nThe Delmarva Chicken Association said it has worked with both the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture to get announcements out. But they said farmers know exactly what to look for.\n\"What we are telling everyone is, if you look up and you see a bird, you just anticipate there's avian influenza,\" Porter said. \"So if you're a chicken grower, you've known for years that the waterfowl are carriers of avian influenza.\"\nAlthough the four control areas have been released, the Delmarva Chicken Association urges farmers to stay safe and continue to take the precautions necessary to prevent the spread of the disease.\nFor more information, visit dcachicken.com/resources/HPAI.cfm. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "On the front lines against bird flu, egg farmers say they’re losing the battle\n\n February 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Kate Wells Michigan Public KFF Health News | Section: News \n \n 1420\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Greg Herbruck knew 6.5 million of his birds needed to die, and fast.But the CEO of Herbruck's Poultry Ranch wasn't sure how the family egg producer (one of the largest in the U.S.) was going to get through it, financially or emotionally. One staffer broke down in Herbruck's office in tears.\n\"The mental toll on our team of dealing with that many dead chickens is just, I mean, you can't imagine it,\" Herbruck said. \"I didn't sleep. Our team didn't sleep.\"\nThe stress of watching tens of thousands of sick birds die of avian flu each day, while millions of others waited to be euthanized, kept everyone awake.\nIn April 2024, as his first hens tested positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus, Herbruck turned to the tried-and-true U.S. Department of Agriculture playbook, the \"stamping-out\" strategy that helped end the 2014-15 bird flu outbreak, which was the largest in the U.S. until now.\nWithin 24 to 48 hours of the first detection of the virus, state and federal animal health officials work with farms to cull infected flocks to reduce the risk of transmission. That's followed by extensive disinfection and months of surveillance and testing to make sure the virus isn't still lurking somewhere on-site.\nSince then, egg farms have had to invest millions of dollars into biosecurity. But their efforts have not been enough to contain the outbreak that started three years ago.\nThis time, the risk to human health is only growing, experts say. Sixty-six of the 67 total human cases in the United States have been just since March, including the nation's first human death, reported last month.\n\"The last six months have accelerated my concern, which was already high,\" said Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious diseases physician and the founding director of Boston University's Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases.\nControlling this virus has become more challenging because it's so entrenched in the global environment, spilling into mammals such as dairy cows and affecting roughly 150 million birds in commercial and backyard flocks in the U.S.\nBecause laying hens are so susceptible to the virus, egg producers have been on the front lines in the fight against various bird flu strains for years. But this moment feels different. Egg producers and the American Egg Board, an industry group, are begging for a new prevention strategy.\n\"The one we're battling today is unique,\" said David Swayne, former director of the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory at the USDA's Agricultural Research Service and a leading national expert in avian influenza.\n\"It's not saying for sure there's gonna be a pandemic\" of H5N1, Swayne said, \"but it's saying the more human infections, the spreading into multiple mammal species is concerning.\"\nFor Herbruck, it feels like war. Ten months after Herbruck's Poultry Ranch was hit, the company is still rebuilding its flocks and rehired most of the 400 workers it laid off.\nStill, he and his counterparts in the industry live in fear, watching other farms get hit two, even three times in the past few years.\n\"I call this virus a terrorist,\" he said. \"And we are in a battle and losing, at the moment.\"\nWhen Biosecurity Isn't WorkingThe official message to both backyard farm enthusiasts and mega-farms has been broadly the same: Biosecurity is your best weapon against the spread of disease.\nBut there's a range of opinions among backyard flock owners about how seriously to take bird flu, said Katie Ockert, a Michigan State University Extension educator who specializes in biosecurity communications.\nSkeptics think \"we're making a mountain out of a molehill,\" Ockert said, or that \"the media is maybe blowing it out of proportion.\"\nThis means there are two types of backyard poultry enthusiasts, Ockert said: those doing great biosecurity, and those who aren't even trying. \"I see both,\" she said. \"I don't feel like there's really any middle ground there for people.\"\nAnd the challenges of biosecurity are completely different for backyard coops than massive commercial barns.\nRosemary Reams, an 82-year-old retired educator in Ionia, Michigan, grew up farming and has been helping the local 4-H poultry program for years, teaching kids how to raise poultry. Now, with the bird flu outbreak, \"I just don't let people go out to my barn,\" she said.\nReams even swapped real birds with fake ones for kids to use while being assessed by judges at recent 4-H competitions, she said.\n\"We made changes to the fair last year, which I got questioned about a lot. And I said, 'No, I gotta think about the safety of the kids.'\"\nReams was shocked by the news of the death of the Louisiana backyard flock owner. She even has questioned whether she should continue to keep her own flock of 20 to 30 chickens and a pair of turkeys.\n\"But I love 'em. At my age, I need to be doing it. I need to be outside,\" Reams said. \"That's what life is about.\" She said she'll do her best to protect herself and her 4-H kids from bird flu.\nEven \"the best biosecurity in the world\" hasn't been enough to save large commercial farms from infection, said Emily Metz, president and CEO of the American Egg Board.\nThe egg industry thought it learned how to outsmart this virus after the 2014-15 outbreak. Egg producers went into lockdown, she said, developing intensive biosecurity measures to try to block the routes of transmission from wild birds or other farms.\nMetz said the measures egg producers are taking now are extensive.\n\"They have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in improvements, everything from truck washing stations — which is washing every truck from the FedEx man to the feed truck — and everything in between: busing in workers so that there's less foot traffic, laser light systems to prevent waterfowl from landing.\"\nLateral spread, when the virus is transmitted from farm to farm, has dropped dramatically, down from 70% of cases in the last outbreak to just 15% as of April 2023, according to the USDA.\nAnd yet, Metz said, \"all the measures we're doing are still getting beat by this virus.\"\nVaccinating BirdsPerhaps the most contentious debate about bird flu in the poultry industry right now is whether to vaccinate flocks.\nIn 2023, the World Organization for Animal Health urged nations to consider vaccination \"as part of a broader disease prevention and control strategy.\"\nSwayne, the avian influenza expert and poultry veterinarian, works with WOAH and said most of his colleagues in the animal and public health world \"see vaccination of poultry as a positive tool in controlling this panzootic in animals,\" but also as a tool that reduces chances for human infection, and chances for additional mutations of the virus to become more human-adapted.\nBut vaccination could put poultry meat exporters (whose birds are genetically less susceptible to H5N1 than laying hens) at risk of losing billions of dollars in international trade deals. That's because of concerns that vaccination, which lowers the severity of disease in poultry, could mask infections and bring the virus across borders, according to John Clifford, a former chief veterinary officer of the USDA. Clifford is currently an adviser to the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council.\n\"If we vaccinate, we not only lose $6 billion potentially in exports a year,\" Clifford said. \"If they shut us off, that product comes back on the U.S. market. Our economists looked at this and said we would lose $18 billion domestically.\"\nClifford added that would also mean the loss of \"over 200,000 agricultural jobs.\"\nEven if those trade rules changed to allow meat and eggs to be harvested from vaccinated birds, logistical hurdles remain.\n\"Vaccination possibly could be on the horizon in the future, but it's not going to be tomorrow or the next day, next year, or whatever,\" Clifford said.\nNo current HPAI vaccine is a perfect match for the current strain, according to the USDA. But if the virus evolves to be able to transmit efficiently from human to human, he said, \"that would be a game changer for everybody, which would probably force vaccination.\"\nLast month, the USDA announced it would \"pursue a stockpile that matches current outbreak strains\" in poultry.\n\"While deploying a vaccine for poultry would be difficult in practice and may have trade implications, in addition to uncertainty about its effectiveness, USDA has continued to support research and development in avian vaccines,\" the agency said.\nAt this point, Metz argued, the industry can't afford not to try vaccination, which has helped eradicate diseases in poultry before.\n\"We're desperate, and we need every possible tool,\" she said. \"And right now, we're fighting this virus with at least one, if not two, arms tied behind our back. And the vaccine can be a huge hammer in our toolbox.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Eastern Shore farmers organize against proposed solar legislation\n\n February 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STAFF REPORT | Section: Local News \n \n 570\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RUTHSBURG — Farmers representing seven of nine Eastern Shore counties met in Ruthsburg last week to organize against Senate Bill 0931. The proposed legislation is a bill the Farmer's Alliance for Rural Maryland believes will have irreversible impacts to Maryland's farming lands and rural communities.The bill is sponsored by Sen. Brian Feldman of Montgomery County.\nAs written, the proposed legislation seeks to remove local zoning authority governing solar projects. Many farmers and farmland owners on the Eastern Shore believe the bill will permanently damage the future of agriculture in Maryland if passed by the legislature and signed by Gov. Wes Moore.\nThe Farmer's Alliance, founded by Pat Langenfelder of Kennedyville, Ed Fry of Chestertown, Bobby Hutchinson of Cordova and Rob Davis of Sassafras, held an organizational meeting in January prior to the larger meeting last week. Farmers at both meetings were concerned over how solar projects would impact productive farming lands, soils and economies in rural communities on the Eastern Shore.\n\"Seeing good farmland being taken over by solar projects like the one in Greensboro makes me sick,\" Fry said. He was referring to the recently approved project that traverses both sides of Route 313 north of Greensboro. Other large-scale solar projects are slated for Queen Anne's County, Kent County, Caroline County and Talbot County.\nSenate Bill 0931 uses a legal mechanism known as \"preemption\" that would allow the state to override county and municipal land use plans. Instead of residents expressing concerns to their local county commissioners or municipal governments, the bill would direct citizen concerns and appeals to the Public Service Commission in Baltimore.\n\"We're going to fight this bill with everything we can,\" said Queen Anne's County Commissioner Jim Moran. \"We do not want to see a proliferation of mega solar farms in Queen Anne's County.\"\nQueen Anne's Conservation Association representative Jay Falstad described Senate Bill 0931 as \"…the single greatest attack on the future of agriculture in Maryland's 247-year history. It's a land grab driven by ruthless, Wall-Street-backed solar developers eager to get farmers to sign long-term contracts and future access to their lands. Beware of what's in those contracts.\"\nRecently, Caroline County and Queen Anne's County have advanced public notifications to the agricultural community recommending farm owners be cautious in signing any solar leases consulting attorneys.\nThe Maryland Energy Administration has a goal of converting up to 5% of Eastern Shore farmland for solar projects — the equivalent of over 55,000 acres on the Eastern Shore and nearly 200,000 acres across the state.\nThe Farmer's Alliance believes that level of conversion will have irreversible impacts to Maryland's agricultural growing capacity. According to the Maryland Department of Agriculture website, \"Agriculture is Maryland's largest commercial industry employing thousands of citizens across the State and contributing billions of dollars to the Maryland economy.\"\nFarm owner Scott MacGlashan of Church Hill expressed concern for the future of farming if the bill were to pass. \"These solar companies are offering unfair leases that young farmers cannot compete with. Big Solar is subsidized with a combination of federal and state subsidies, that are so disproportionate as to create an uneven playing field that will kill farming,\" he said.\nThe Farmer's Alliance for Rural Maryland isn't the only organization to oppose Senate Bill 0931. The Maryland Association of Counties, the Maryland Farm Bureau and the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy are also opposed.\nMark Sultenfuss of Ruthsburg said, \"Defeating Senate Bill 0931 isn't just a battle, it's a war, and we must win it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Farmers testify against state solar legislation\n\n March 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 720\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Lawmakers, renewable energy advocates and local farmers clashed last week before the Education, Energy and the Environment Committee as testimony on Senate Bill 931 — the Renewable Energy Certainty Act — focused on preserving productive farmland for food security amid growing solar developments.Testimony in the Maryland General Assembly opened with concerns that renewable energy installations are encroaching on Maryland's limited agricultural lands. Caroline County Commissioner Travis Breeding noted that solar projects now cover nearly 2% of the county's farmland — \"double the state's estimate that 1% of the state's agricultural land will be consumed.\"\n\"This isn't just about renewable energy — it's about safeguarding our food supply for future generations,\" another citizen said.\nSpeakers from across the region detailed the complex trade-offs at stake. Judy Gifford, a dairy farmer from Kent County, explained that while her farm has successfully integrated rooftop solar on several outbuildings since 2015, she warned that no solar project has ever returned land to farming.\n\"We won't know where the tipping point is until we've reached it,\" Gifford asserted, adding that once decommissioned, solar panels are likely to be replaced by other developments — data centers or nuclear reactors, for example. She decried the state's disregard for its \"400-year-old cultural landscape\" and the lack of local input on sweeping amendments.\nRenee Hamidi, executive director of the Values Planning Council in Baltimore County, urged an unfavorable vote on the legislation. She argued that stripping counties of their authority to regulate solar siting would undo years of hard-won land use protections.\n\"Counties know from sad experience that once farmland is lost, it's gone forever,\" Hamidi said, noting that alternative sites — such as rooftops, parking lots and brownfields — could be leveraged instead of sacrificing productive land.\n\"When you put a farm in solar, you're taking opportunity away from young farmers,\" Rob Davis, a seventh-generation grain and poultry farmer from the Eastern Shore and board member of the Maryland Grain Producers, contended, emphasizing that Maryland's world-class agriculture is essential for local food security.\nCaroline County farmer Matthew Jones expressed personal concern for his family's future. \"My daughter's going to speak in a little while about what our farm faces,\" Jones said, pleading with the panel to ease her worries about eminent domain. His remarks underscored the broader anxiety among farmers about losing hard-won land amid rapid development.\nRepresenting interests from Queen Anne's and St. Mary's counties, Bruce Berriano urged the panel to study the longstanding local statutes in Caroline and Queen Anne's counties. \"What's working there really works,\" he said, calling on legislators to craft amendments that reflect local histories rather than impose a one-size-fits-all mandate.\nDonna Landis Smith, a Queen Anne's County land preservation specialist with 20 years of experience, echoed those local concerns. She described Senate Bill 931 and House Bill 1036 as \"bad bills,\" contending that state agencies should never override local county decisions regarding renewable energy siting. \"There are no circumstances in which the state, including the Public Service Commission, should override local decisions without the county's input,\" she asserted.\nThe proposed legislation, which outlines the permitting, siting and development of generating stations — including solar arrays — is available in full on the Maryland General Assembly website.\nAs the committee continues its review of SB 931, lawmakers pledged to weigh local zoning measures alongside environmental and economic imperatives. \"We must find a middle ground that supports sustainable energy development while protecting our agricultural roots,\" one committee member said.\nThe debate over SB 931 reflects a broader national conversation about reconciling environmental progress with food security and local economies. With Maryland poised to expand its renewable energy footprint, Friday's hearing underscored the urgency of developing a balanced approach that honors both technological advancement and the state's agricultural heritage.\nIn a spirited call to arms, Jay Falstad, executive director of the Queen Anne's Conservation Association, wrote members of the Farmers Alliance for Rural Maryland rallied supporters after the hearing.\n\"Yesterday was a momentous day. Farmers from multiple counties came to Annapolis, rallied in front of the Statehouse and testified on the need to protect our rural areas against solar sprawl,\" Falstad said.\nHe acknowledged the challenges posed by dismissive remarks from committee leadership but stressed that key legislators had revealed their positions. \"We now know where the soft spots are,\" he added, urging stakeholders to \"roll up our sleeves\" and continue the fight for responsible land use. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Safer, more humane egg production\n\n March 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 316\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Eggs are a hot topic across the country and in our community, as prices rise and worries about bird flu are becoming more concerning. Something else to consider is a bill that is currently in front of the Maryland Legislature, SB 806/HB 0834, that could make a huge improvement for our state's animal welfare and food safety, regarding the sale of eggs.SB 806/HB 0834 would ban the sale of eggs coming from hens housed in battery cages and extreme confinement. Many other states and countries have outlawed this practice, and Maryland has the opportunity to keep up with the industry by implementing this bill into effect.\nSupporting this bill has the possibility to improve food safety. The cramped, unsanitary conditions in battery cages have been linked to higher rates of salmonella, making cage-free systems a safer alternative for egg eaters. The cost difference between cage and cage-free systems is minimal, estimated at less than a couple of pennies per egg. As cage-free eggs become the standard, retail prices are expected to decrease, benefiting consumers without compromising quality or safety. Even McDonald's went 100% cage-free last year without putting an increased cost of eggs on customers.\nMany of us have seen the poor chickens crammed into trucks while driving down the highway on the Eastern Shore, and it's hard to turn an eye to the cruelty. This bill would help improve the lives of these animals, so that they aren't cramped in tiny cages where they can't open their wings or perform any natural behaviors. Getting them out of these cages is a huge step in the right direction, allowing them freedom to dust bathe, perch, spread their wings and more.\nI ask lawmakers and residents to uplift SB 806/HB 0834, as it provides a hopeful solution to support farmers, consumers and animals alike. It's time for Maryland to take a stand for safer, more humane egg production.\nJENNIFER HEIMERT\nCordova \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Last year, Stacey Hann-Ruff, the director of arts center, announced during a presentation to the Calvert County commissioners that Annmarie Garden officials plan to expand the existing sculpture garden to include the 20-acres.\nIn 1991, Francis and Ann Marie Koenig donated the land where the facility is located. The expansion plans include a 15,000-square foot welcome center.\nThe Calvert County Master Gardeners program trains volunteer horticulture educators to support the University of Maryland Extension's initiative to educate locals about best horticulture practices.\nNoting that the greenhouse project is being supported by state grant money from the Maryland General Assembly, the Rural Maryland Council and the Cove Point Natural Heritage Trust, Edward Goodman, the local master gardener specialist, called the effort \"an amazing collaboration.\"\nGoodman told Southern Maryland News there are about 50 active master gardeners. The training course takes about three to four months to complete and is culminated by a final exam. Then, the master gardener candidate must complete 40 hours of community service.\n\"There are lots of opportunities,\" Goodman said.\nThe fledgling master gardeners share their knowledge at such venues as the North Beach Nature Center, Calvert Marine Museum and numerous other locations.\n\"The biggest thing of the mater gardener program is to educate others on sustainable horticulture practices,\" Goodman said.\nWhile he couldn't provide a timeline for when the greenhouse would be completed, Goodman said \"the project has crossed the hurdle of permitting and processing.\"\n\"This is the first step in the [expansion] plan,\" Cari DeSantis of Ann's Circle, the nonprofit organization that supports many programs and activities at Annmarie Garden.\nIn briefly addressing the gathering, Bruce Fall of the Cove Point Natural Heritage Trust commended the garden's staff and volunteers \"for bringing people in to our area with events.\"\nFall said the visitors, who come to the garden for such traffic-jamming events as Artsfest and Halloween in the Garden, spend their cash at local restaurants and other businesses, which bolsters the area's economy.\nBefore grabbing shovels for some fun in the patch of dirt where the new greenhouse will stand, plastic glasses of champagne and cider were distributed to attendees. Everyone drank a toast.\nDeSantis said the toast was \"to celebrate the public-private partnerships that make Calvert County such a beautiful place.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "On Gardening: Three-part harmony container design for beginners\n\n March 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Norman Winter | Section: Entertainment \n \n 560\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As spring approaches at jet speed and you start thinking about planting mixed containers (but perhaps with a little fear of the partnerships) keep in mind three-part harmony. It certainly works in church music, and it is perfect for gardeners too!In the world of garden color, we call it triadic harmony. Simply put, triadic harmony is three colors spread equal distance apart on the color wheel. So in the mixed container or basket, this would be three colors of flowers to create pleasing harmony.\nRowe Farms is not only one of my favorite growers of seasonal flower color, but their Facebook page is a textbook on design ideas. Though they are in Jacksonville, a small city in east Texas, their product is found in Dallas, Fort Worth, Oklahoma City, Houston and Shreveport and locations in between.\nRecently they featured some recipes that would soon be hitting garden centers. One was called Prime Time, and the other was Santa Belle. Of course, if you find ready-made baskets or planters, you've got your design creation. If you find the individual plants for sale you can copy the recipe. But Prime Time and Santa Belle, though created with different plants, have one thing the same, and that is color. They each have red, blue and yellow in a perfect triadic or three-part harmony.\nThe PrimeTime recipe features three Supertunia Mini Vista petunias, Yellow, Indigo and Scarlet that will dazzle all summer. Superbells Grape Punch, Pomegranate Punch and Yellow calibrachoas could have accomplished a similar look or recipe. This is what the Santa Belle recipe did but using Laguna Dark Blue lobelia, Superbells Yellow calibrachoa and Superbena Scarlet Eye verbena.\nThe red, blue and yellow scheme is one of the easiest for gardeners to put together. I used Superbena Violet Ice verbena, Supertunia Mini Vista Scarlet petunia and Superbells Yellow calibrachoa. Triadic harmony with red, blue and yellow delivers a lot of dazzle in quick and easy fashion.\nLast spring I did another container with some of this year's new flowers, Virtuoso Classy Carmine dahlia, Stardiva Blue scaevola and Supertunia Saffron Finch petunia with cheerful yellow flowers. The colors were perfect!\nIf you have noticed, the rules in triadic harmony, particularly when using flowers, are not exacting or mandatory in color, but approximations. Some of our blues were violets and indigo, and even Superbells Grape Punch is purple with blackeye but looks blue throughout the day with changing light angles.\nAlways remember substitutes are allowed. One of my favorite containers from a couple of years ago featured Superbells Grape Punch calibrachoa, Supertunia Mini Vista Scarlet petunia and since I did not have a yellow flower available, I used Snow Princess sweet alyssum with white flowers as the perfect substitute. They say white is the absence of color, but I am not sure I buy that when it comes to flowers.\nRed, blue and yellow is like harmony for beginners. Look at color wheels online and pick out your favorite color. Then you can see which colors are equal distances apart. I like orange so one of its colors is green, which of course will come from leaves.\nYou may have heard an old saying that close only works with horseshoes and hand grenades, but I assure you it works in picking harmonious flower colors too.\nStart planning for spring and follow me on my Facebook page @NormanWinterTheGardenGuy for more photos and garden inspiration. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They are good for a healthy snack, or to add to a meal, promoting healthy living.\nOwners Jessica and Brien Jackson got the name Fat & Happy Farms, from their beloved rabbit, Buck Bunny, who was \"lovingly referred to as being fat and happy when he was eating his veggies.\" And like how a bunny jumps from spot to spot, finding the right mix of nutrients, visitors to Jessica and Brien's table are treated to a variety of sprouts, featuring 60 mixes Jessica made herself.\nMixes like Spicy Salad mix, consist of broccoli, kale, purple kohlrabi, arugula, Red Acres cabbage, and southern giant mustard. Feeling low energy? They have a mix for that, using specific microgreens loaded with B vitamins, fiber, magnesium and iron, which all help restore daily energy levels.\nJessica says a lot of her customers ask her what kinds of microgreens are good for specific medical conditions like diabetes or even attention deficit disorder.\n\"Because food is medicine,\" she pointed out.\nJessica commits her extra energy in growing the company, expanding to markets in Kent Island, St. Michaels, and maybe soon, nearby Centreville. She's also aiming to get their creative blends of healthy greens into more restaurants.\nUnlike the growing cycle of plants, from seed, to sprout, to full grown plant, Fat & Happy Farms kinda reversed that operation.\nThey started selling produce, and now are mainly selling sprouts.\nIn 2020, Brien found he had more free time and more vegetables in his garden than he could consume. They started going to the farmer's market to sell their produce.\nHowever Jessica was deathly afraid of snakes, and living in Grasonville near the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Center next to a marsh, did not inspire her to grow (or go) outside.\nBut they did have a nice big garage, she said, and soon sprouts took up that entire space.\nWhen Brien got a job requiring more time and dedication, Jessica took over the sprout business. She said there are often times when she puts in 60+ hours into it, marketing, looking for ways to expand. They not only sell sprouts but sell sprout kits and seeds as well, inspiring people to grow their own.\nThey encourage the public to reach out to them when they see them at their table or here at fatandhappyfarms.com.\n\"It's locally grown with love — from our family to yours,\" Jessica and Brien adds. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Queenstown Bank holds lunch for farmers, shares trade predictions\n\n March 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 503\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — During Queenstown Bank's third annual Farmers Appreciation Lunch Thursday, keynote speaker Chad Nagel talked about the resilience of farmers.\"The thing that I love about farmers that I think is unique is we're naturally wired to expect hard times,\" he said. \"The average person shows up, the go to a job, they expect good times. They expect a cost of living increase in their salary year after year. And when hard times come, they're a little bit shaken.\"\nNagel, who is the vice president of Nagel Farm Service, said farmers are different.\n\"We're wired for the challenges and the difficulties,\" he said, later adding this brings out hope in farmers.\nThroughout much of his presentation, Nagel shared his corn and soybean price predictions for the upcoming season. After warning his predictions aren't always right, Nagel reminded farmers not to be afraid to sell early.\n\"Because you don't always get to exactly where you thought it would be,\" he said.\nWhen it comes to corn, Nagel estimated the trading range this year will be between $5 and $5.30 per bushel.\nLooking at long-term weather predictions, Nagel said there is a chance that target price for corn could increase. He said while it is looking like the Mid-Atlantic will have normal temperatures and precipitation this season, the \"western corn belt,\" which includes Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, could see hotter and drier conditions than usual.\n\"These are big production states, and to take a hit in that area would be meaningful for price,\" Nagel said.\nFor soybeans, Nagel estimated the trading range this year will be $11 to $11.50 per bushel.\nAlthough there are multiple reasons to be concerned about soybean prices, from a vessel tax to large soybean production in Brazil, Nagel said he thinks farmers can stop worrying about how much lower soybeans are going to go in terms of price per bushel.\n\"I'm going to say I think the bottom is in on beans,\" he said, later adding that once the country gets \"some tariff business out of the way,\" it should be over the hump with soybean prices.\nBefore Nagel spoke, Dorchester County farmer Philip Jackson said he was doubtful the markets would be looking good this year.\n\"It's just things cost too much, and the price of grain is down,\" he said. \"So it's going to be hard on people this year.\"\nBut like Nagel said about farmers having hope, Jackson acknowledged things could change.\n\"It's just starting,\" Jackson said about the season. \"It's not ending. And that's the way you've got to look at it.\"\nPut on by Queenstown Bank, the lunch was held at American Legion Post 91 in Cambridge. Queenstown Bank Chief Risk Officer and Chief Administrative Officer Tracy Whitby-Fairall said the lunch is put on in an effort to reach the community's farm and agriculture businesses so they know Queenstown Bank is a \"friend of this community.\"\n\"Big banks talk about ag lending portfolios,\" Whitby-Fairall said. \"We talk about your farm, we talk about your family and we talk about your future. That's how we want to partner with you.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Country Cooking: The egg basket and the hen house\n\n April 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1273\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Yes — we had a special basket just for the eggs.This basket was deep with a heavy-duty handle, and the bottom of the basket was slightly raised in the center. The eggs would sit in the basket perfectly without moving around.\nThis basket was always stored in the large kitchen closet, not exposed to weather, and was stored each morning after the egg pick-up.\nWhen the eggs were brought in the kitchen, Mom would remove the eggs, placing them in a big white rectangular shaped basin to be wiped individually and placed in cartons or another lighter basket for storage. The number of eggs varied each morning from a dozen to maybe three dozen or more.\nEach morning, Mom would place leftover eggs from the day before on top of the fresh eggs. When there was an overabundance of eggs, they were given to family members or sold very cheap to neighbors who did not have \"laying hens.\"\nThe egg basket was retired forever in November 1997 with the farm wife who proudly wore her country bonnet while doing her chores for over 70 years.\nThe hen house was a special small building on the farm behind the storage shed. This house was just for the hens, with their boxes mounted in rows on the wall with small ladders going up for the hens to climb in and out.\nKeeping the boxes off the floor kept the eggs safe from intruders. These \"hen boxes\" were partially filled with clean straw when needed. There was a set of three windows across the front covered with wire and one side door that opened to a wired poultry yard to keep the hens safe from predators.\nFirst, I got the eggs from the empty nests, and then there were about five more nests with hens still sitting on them, but mom said I had to get them all. Have you ever heard of the saying \"madder than a wet hen?\" Well, I proceeded to lift the hen up to get the eggs, and she pecked at my hand, and the party was on — hens squawking and me screaming.\nI reach over and get the old broom I kept in the chicken house and start trying to get her off the nest. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it did not work. When I thought I had enough eggs, I went into the house looking \"madder than a wet hen.\"\nBRUSSELS SPROUTS HASH\n6 slices bacon (cut into 1-inch pieces), 1/2 onion (chopped), 1 lb Brussels sprouts (trimmed and quartered), Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 2 cloves garlic (minced), 4 large eggs.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crispy. Turn off heat and transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Drain all but about 1 tbsp bacon fat. Turn heat back to medium and add onion and Brussels sprouts to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften and turn golden. Season with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. Add 2 tbsps of water and cover the skillet. Cook until Brussels sprouts are tender and water has evaporated, about 5 minutes. (If all the water evaporates before the Brussels sprouts are tender, add more water to the skillet and cover for a couple minutes more.) Add garlic to the skillet and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Using a wooden spoon, make four holes in the hash to reveal the bottom of the skillet. Crack an egg into each hole and season each egg with salt and pepper. Replace lid and cook until eggs are cooked to your liking, about 5 minutes for a just-runny egg. Sprinkle cooked bacon bits over the entire skillet and serve warm.\nCOWBOY BREAKFAST BOWL\n8 slices bacon, 2 medium russet potatoes (cubed), 1/4 cup sliced green onions plus more for garnish, 3 cloves garlic (minced), 1 tbsp paprika, Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 2 cups shredded Cheddar, 10 eggs (scrambled), 1 avocado (sliced), hot sauce for serving.\nIn a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crispy, 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and let cool, then chop. Add potatoes to bacon fat and cook undisturbed for 10 minutes, then flip and move around to get all sides golden. Add green onions and cook until potatoes are tender, 10 minutes more. Once tender, add garlic, paprika, salt and pepper. Add cheddar to potatoes and cover to melt. Build bowls: Top cheesy potatoes with scrambled eggs, sliced avocado, cooked bacon, more scallions and a drizzle of hot sauce.\nHAM AND CHEESE EGG CUPS\nCooking spray for pan, 12 slices ham, 1 cup shredded cheddar, 12 large eggs, Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees and grease a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray. Line each cup with a slice of ham and sprinkle with cheddar. Crack an egg into each ham cup and season with salt and pepper. Bake until eggs are cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes (depending on how runny you like your yolks).\nPHILLY CHEESESTEAK OMELET\n2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, 1 onion (thinly sliced), 2 bell peppers (thinly sliced), 8 oz button mushrooms (thinly sliced), Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 lb sirloin steak (thinly sliced), 6 large eggs, 3 tbsps milk, 1 cup shredded provolone, 1 tbsp butter.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tbsp of olive oil. Add onions, peppers and mushrooms and season with salt and pepper, then cook until softened, about 10 minutes. Move veggies to one side of the skillet and heat the remaining tablespoon of oil. Add steak to the empty side of the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Cook until undersides develop a crust, about 2 minutes, then flip steak and cook 1 minute more for medium. Stir steak together with vegetables, then transfer to a plate.\nMake omelet: In the same skillet over medium heat, melt butter. In a small bowl, beat eggs and milk and season with salt and pepper, then pour half the egg mixture into the skillet. Cook until eggs begin to set around edges, about 30 seconds, then use a spatula to gently lift around edges, allowing uncooked egg to flow to center. Once set, add a layer of provolone to one side of the omelet, then top cheese with half the steak mixture. Top with another layer of provolone, then cover the skillet with a lid and cook until melted, 1 minute. Use a spatula to flip the untopped side over to cover. Repeat with remaining ingredients for the second omelet.\nEGG CUSTARD\n5 eggs, ½ cup sugar, 1 1/2 tsps vanilla, ½ tsp salt, 4 cups 2% or whole milk, Nutmeg for topping.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease an 8-by-8-inch baking dish. In a large bowl, beat together the eggs, sugar, vanilla, and salt. In a small saucepan, heat the milk to about 180 degrees or just before it starts to simmer (do not boil). Very slowly pour a stream of the hot milk into the egg mixture while continuously whisking until fully combined. Whisk the final mixture for one additional minute. Pour into the prepared baking dish and sprinkle nutmeg over the top if desired. Fill a larger baking dish with water until it is about 1 inch deep. Place the dish of custard into the larger dish of water, careful not to splash. Place the doubled dishes in the oven and bake for 45-50 minutes or until an inserted knife comes out clean, custard will still jiggle. Be careful not to overbake as the custard will curdle. Serve warm or chilled, and top with whipped cream, fruit, or additional spices. Refrigerate any leftovers. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Farmers Alliance For Rural Maryland pushes for veto of solar bills\n\n April 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 627\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — The Farmers Alliance For Rural Maryland's position on farm land is the reason it will ask Gov. Wes Moore to veto Senate Bill 931 and House Bill 1036.\"The position of Farmers Alliance is no agricultural acre ought to be taken up for solar projects when you have other surface options available,\" said Jay Falstad, executive director of the Queen Anne's Conservation Association and member of the farm alliance. \"If we're going to hold true that principle that no acres should be taken up at all, then why would we be accepting of 5% and many tens of thousands of acres?\"\nThe renewable energy bills the alliance plans to oppose are aimed at increasing generation of energy within the state by promoting solar energy production. The bills were passed by both chambers of the state legislature during the General Assembly, which ended last week.\nThe farm alliance largely draws its criticism of the bills from a provision instituting a 5% cap for solar development on a county's priority preservation areas, or agricultural land.\n\"So we're going to be asking the governor to veto 931,\" Falstad said. \"Concurrent with that, we're going to be asking him to advance an executive order that protects Eastern Shore counties from being disproportionately targeted for solar projects.\"\nThe farmers alliance came before the Caroline County commissioners on Tuesday to discuss the passed solar bill and its plan to ask for a veto.\nAccording to its website, the alliance is \"a grassroots organization of Maryland farmers and agriculture advocates working to protect and preserve Maryland's rural landscapes.\"\nOne of the biggest concerns for Mid-Shore lawmakers and the farm alliance this legislative session was solar energy.\nShore lawmakers advocated against inclusions such as the 5% cap, arguing it superseded county authority to limit solar development. In several counties, including Caroline County, stricter moratoriums for solar development had already been enacted.\n\"So for instance, in Caroline County, at 5%, that could be up to 4,500 acres on projects over 2 megawatts,\" Falstad said. \"That does not include the community solar projects for which you all have a few already in your pipeline, I think.\"\n\"So the overall number of acres of farmland consumed for solar projects on the Eastern Shore alone is tens of thousands of acres. In Kent, Queen Anne's, Caroline, Talbot County, it's well over 10,000 acres alone, and that type of impact will surely have implications to our agricultural community and the ancillary businesses that they support.\"\nThe alliance believes there are options in the western part of the state that should be looked at before the Eastern Shore.\n\"If solar is such a high priority for the state of Maryland, then how about we start with every single government building in Maryland including parking lots,\" Falstad said.\n\"Let's start there first, and once we've exhausted all those opportunities, then we can start looking at other options, but not before we start utilizing brownfields or old mining sites in western Maryland. Any one of these places could be used for solar, and we really ought to be starting there, and the governor can show some leadership.\"\nIn the presentation at the Caroline County meeting, the alliance asked the commissioners to send a letter requesting the governor veto the bill.\nThe commissioners unanimously agreed to send the letter.\nIf the governor does veto the bill, Caroline County Commissioners President Travis Breeding said there is still work to be done on renewable energy in the state.\n\"I will add, though, that the fight is not over,\" Breeding said. \"If he does veto it, it reverts back to this existing process that we have right now. We're preempted by the ruling of a public utility law judge, so that's what needs to be fixed somehow.\n\"If it can be addressed through executive order, ultimately it needs to be done legislatively.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tariffs jeopardize $300M in Shore ag exports\n\n April 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM BRUCE | Section: Columns \n \n 386\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n President Trump's abrupt announcement of tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports provoked them to impose retaliatory tariffs of 125% on U.S. goods exported to China. This jeopardizes our $300 million in exports to China from Maryland's 1st Congressional District, including from all of Talbot County and the rest of the Eastern Shore.Yet the tariff negotiations with China are bogged down in a childish game of who will blink and telephone first. China is hardly blameless on tariffs, but the tragedy for our farmers and businessmen is that our president and our congressman brought on themselves this latest threat to the future exports of Talbot County and the Eastern Shore.\nRecall that just after President Trump levied a massive 104% import tariff on Chinese goods, he bragged on April 9, at a mega-fundraiser, \"These countries are calling us up, kissing my ass to negotiate deals on tariffs. They are dying to make a deal … [saying] 'Please, Sir, make a deal. I'll do anything, Sir.'\"\nTrump thus portrayed initiating a call to the U.S. to negotiate tariffs as a demeaning, obscene act by our trading partner. This mocking and senseless incivility to all our trading partners, including China, explains why China's commerce ministry said on the next day that China is open to dialogue with the U.S. on tariffs, but it must be based on \"mutual respect.\" Doubling down on the insult, Trump then insisted that the Chinese president must call first for negotiations to begin.\nYou need not be an expert in tariffs to know that for 3,000 years, the importance of respect, saving face, is deeply embedded in Chinese culture. Any real U.S. negotiator on any subject would know this. It further confirms that Trump hatched his chaotic and amateurish tariff plan on the fly without careful planning. Soon afterward, China did make the call, not to urge the U.S. to negotiate the tariffs, but for the U.S to capitulate and \"completely cancel\" Trump's reciprocal tariffs.\nThe standoff remains.\nWhat's at stake is no small matter. In 2022 our farmers and businesses in Maryland's 1st Congressional District exported over $300 million in goods and services to China. China's retaliatory tariffs of 125% now imperil our exports. Yet our Congressman Andy Harris simply endorses Trump's turbulent tariffs, despite the threat to agriculture, e.g., soybeans, and other businesses in his district. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Country Cooking: Fresh asparagus",
    "date": "2025-04-21",

    "content": "Country Cooking: Fresh asparagus\n\n April 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1230\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fresh asparagus is a sure sign that spring has arrived.My mom did not plant asparagus, as not many in the family liked this vegetable. Years later, when I had a garden of my own, I learned how to grow asparagus that would continue coming back each year for at least 18 to 20 years.\nSome rules I learned were to find a space in the garden that had direct sunshine for at least six hours each day. This spot also needs to be well-drained with rich, deep soil. I added compost to ensure the soil was rich and lots of it to have a nice tall row.\nA very important factor: do not plant onions, potatoes, garlic, leeks, shallots or beans near the asparagus, as they seek the sun and overpower with growth to overcome the asparagus sprouts. Properly planted, this delicious vegetable produces many sprouts.\nOne of my first recipes was fried asparagus, given to me by a true southern lady, Ms. Lillie Mae. She has been gone for many years, but the recipe lives on with me.\nFRIED ASPARAGUS\nPrepare about a pound of fresh cut asparagus for cooking. In a skillet over medium heat melt 1/2 cup butter, add 2 tbsps olive oil, 1 tsp coarse salt and 3 minced garlic cloves. Stir and cook until the garlic is strongly fragrant. Place asparagus stalks in the pan and continue cooking and turning with a fork until tender. Drain on paper towels and serve warm.\nASPARAGUS CASSEROLE\nThis goes great with baked ham. In a buttered casserole dish, place a layer of asparagus, then a layer of crumbled cheese nips crackers. Wet with cream of mushroom soup mixed with water according to directions on the can. Finish the casserole with a few more crushed cheese nips. Bake in a 350-degree oven until asparagus is tender.\nROASTED ASPARAGUS\n1 large bunch fresh asparagus, 1 to 2 tsps olive oil, salt, freshly ground black pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees and line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup. Cut off the woody ends of the asparagus, usually about an inch or so is taken off. Place the asparagus on the sheet and drizzle with olive oil, just enough to lightly coat. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the asparagus and toss until the spears are lightly coated in oil. Arrange the spears in a single layer on the pan. Thin asparagus will take as little as nine to 12 minutes, whereas thicker asparagus will need 15 to 20 minutes. Roasted asparagus is best served when it's fresh out of the oven, but it will keep at room temperature for up to one hour or up to two days in the refrigerator.\nASPARAGUS FRITTATA WITH HAM, SPINACH AND CHEESE\n6 eggs, kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 4 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, 4 stalks asparagus (sliced on a into 1-inch pieces), 1 green bell pepper (diced), 1/2 medium red onion (sliced), 3 medium cloves garlic (sliced), 1 cup packed spinach leaves (roughly chopped), 3 ounces sliced ham (cut into 1/2-inch pieces), 4 ounces medium-firm cheese such as cheddar or Jack (cut into 1/2-inch cubes).\nLightly beat eggs with a large pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a large bowl. Set aside. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a 10-inch nonstick, cast iron or carbon steel skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add asparagus and peppers, season with salt and pepper, and cook, tossing and stirring frequently, until asparagus is tender-crisp, about two minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the eggs. Heat 1 tbsp oil in the now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring, until starting to brown around the edges, about two minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until onions and garlic are lightly browned, about a minute longer. Add spinach and cook, stirring, until wilted, about a minute. Transfer to the bowl with the eggs. Add ham (if using) and cheese to the eggs and stir the mixture until everything is evenly combined. Wipe out the skillet. Add remaining 2 tbsps oil to skillet and set over medium-high heat until shimmering. Scrape egg mixture into skillet and cook, swirling and shaking pan rapidly, until bottom and sides begin to set, about three minutes. Using a heat proof spatula, press the edges in to begin to form the frittata's puck shape. Continue to cook, adjusting heat to prevent bottom of frittata from burning, until beginning to set around edges, about three minutes longer. Working over a sink or garbage can, place a large overturned flat plate or lid on top of skillet, set hand on top (using a dish towel if you are sensitive to heat), and, in one very quick motion, invert frittata onto it. Carefully slide the frittata back into the skillet and continue to cook until the second side is beginning to firm up, about two minutes. Use a rubber spatula to again press the sides all around to form a rounded puck shape. Continue to cook the frittata until lightly browned on the second side but still tender in the center when pressed with a finger, about two minutes longer. If desired, you can flip frittata two to three more times during these last minutes of cooking, which helps to cook the center more evenly and reinforce the shape. Carefully slide frittata out of the skillet onto a clean plate and serve.\nCHEESY BAKED ASPARAGUS\n1 bunch of asparagus, 3/4 cup mozzarella (shredded), 1/4 cup parmesan (finely grated), 2 cloves of garlic (minced/finely diced), 1 tbsp olive oil, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp black pepper.\nTrim the woody parts of your asparagus and toss will 1 tbsp olive oil, garlic cloves, salt and pepper. Lay out flat on a baking tray. Place in the oven at 390 degrees for eight to 10 minutes, or until it just starts to wrinkle and soften. Take out the oven, sprinkle over mozzarella then top with parmesan. Put back in the oven and broil until the cheese turn golden and bubbly, with the asparagus fork tender. Serve up right away.\nLEMON ASPARAGUS SALAD\n1 pound penne pasta, 1 pound thin asparagus (trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces), 3 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, 1 small onion (diced), 2 cloves garlic (thinly sliced), 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 lemon (zested and juiced), 1 tsp kosher salt, 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan plus more for serving, 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper plus more for serving, 1/4 cup fresh parsley (finely chopped), 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve ½ cup pasta water, then drain. Set aside. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tbsp of oil. Cook asparagus until crispy, then season with a pinch of salt. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Heat remaining 2 tbsps of oil over medium heat. Cook onions and garlic until softened, about five minutes. Add heavy cream, lemon juice and zest. Bring mixture to a boil, then simmer for five minutes. Add in salt, parmesan and black pepper. Reduce heat to low and mix until well combined. Turn off heat and mix in pasta, asparagus, and parsley until well coated. Add small amounts of pasta water until you reach desired consistency. Serve with more grated parmesan, cracked black pepper and red pepper flakes. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Growing goodness — Sandy's Garden gives back to community\n\n April 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 584\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Sandy Zappia owner of Sandy's Garden donates her produce to the food pantries in Kent County, including the Maryland Food Bank.Fresh fruits and veggies are delivered to those in need, grown using no pesticides or herbicides with natural compost on 3.5 acres on Annie Crow Road. There, a small but dedicated operation of 20-25 volunteers build their organization aiming to make fresh and healthy food available each week.\nOn Saturday, a week before Easter, Zappia delivered a little bit of that joy to the farmers market on High Street, introducing the community to 25 of her baby chicks, the hardworking future egg providers for the community.\nAlthough it was a little cold out, the chicks weren't, warmed by heaters. The chicks greeted children, teens and adults who held and petted them — a friendly Chestertown welcome. Believe it or not, some have never held a baby chick, Zappia said.\nThe recent arrivals, coming from Murray McMurray hatchery are a rainbow assortment which will offer a variety of different colored eggs.\nZappia loved introducing her little feathered friends while teaching lessons on rural life.\n\"Today was exactly what I was hoping for, just spreading joy to people. What a great way to spend a Saturday.\"\nZappia encouraged people to add to their volunteer number as they prepare for summer planting season.\nFor Zappia, gardening is a passion, first discovered through her late husband while raising their three children on a West Virginian farm. When she moved back to Maryland to stay close to her immediate family, she put farming on hold, and had a fulfilling career as a preschool teacher at Friendship Montessori School.\nAfter her husband passed away, and her children were grown, going separate ways, that farming desire was restored. In Rock Hall, there were plans for a garden restaurant and for her to run the garden. Those plans fell through, and attempts for Zappia to purchase the garden did not take root.\nHowever, another opportunity arose, and she purchased 3.5 acres of cornfield, which would become the future home of her own operation.\n\"The idea for Sandy's Garden came about when the restaurant garden where I was working had more produce than we could use- so we donated it to the local food pantry. What an eye-opener! I had no idea of the need for fresh fruit and vegetables in the county. I realized at that moment that I wanted to help meet that need.\"\nSandy's Garden was established, and today there is a garden, a chicken coop to house her newest, adorable arrivals, a beehive to pollinate those plants and a greenhouse so they can grow crops year-round.\nAlthough they are not a 40-acre farm, they can grow a lot with what they have, Zappia exclaimed. With a goal to provide food to the pantry every week, with heart, hard work and dedication they have been doing just that.\nFor example, the date of the interview, April 18, they dropped off 38 pounds of spring crops, lettuce, spinach and kale. In May, they will add warmer weather crops, like tomatoes, green beans and peppers to the mix.\nZappia showed appreciation to all her volunteers, hoping for many others.\n\"I love to teach people but even if you want to just hang out with the chickens, you're welcome to do that too,\" Zappia said.\nSandy's Garden is a non-profit dedicated to nurturing our community by making sure everyone has access to wholesome food. Scope it out at at sandysgarden.org or 304-761-0286 or contact her at sandysgardeninc@gmail.com.\n'We are a happy little self-sustaining area,\" Zappia said, laughing. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

At each station, volunteers talked to students about various aspects of the agricultural field, from animal sciences to land and water safety to farm drones. Organizers said that approximately 80 professionals volunteered their services during the event.\n\"It's giving these seventh graders insight to all the careers available in agriculture, not just working in a field,\" Atticks said.\nBased on feedback after last year's Ag Education Day, organizers set out to make this year's event even better. Mel Bacon, Cecil County Farm Museum's executive director and an Ag Education Day board member, said that surveys and an essay contest given to students who attended the event last year helped them hone in on what made the event shine.\nHe also noted that CCPS has been a huge help in pulling the event off and raising funds\n\"CCPS has been very supportive,\" Bacon said.\nAccording to CCPS Instructional Coordinator Day Mashongamhende, CCPS incorporated Ag Education Day as part of its curriculum for the 1,042 middle schoolers in the county this year, which allowed them to embed the event in the schedule and organize lessons around it.\n\"We teach kids fundamentals,\" Mashongamhende said. \"We see how everything connects.\"\nMashongamhende also noted that CCPS officials took a trip to the Ag Education Day held in Queen Anne's County earlier this year to incorporate ideas from that event into Cecil's own.\nOne of the major goals of the event, organizers stressed, is to interest students in the ag industry and show them that there are a wide range of career options available within ag.\nFollowing the event, there are options for students whose interest has been piqued.\n\"Search out a local 4-H club,\" recommended Paul Rickert with University of Maryland Extension, one of the event's organizers.\nAnother option is to enroll in the Ag Sciences programs that the Cecil County School of Technology offers once the students reach high school.\nAlongside the adult volunteers staffing the event, a number of CCST Ag Sciences students manned stations and worked with the students at Ag Education Day. The CCST students spoke to kids about the programs they are a part of, giving them a preview into things they could be studying in a few short years.\nStudents from non-ag programs at CCST also came at lunchtime to speak with students about their own programs, according to Rachel Coffey, an Agricultural Sciences teacher at CCST.\nCCST juniors Kaitlynne Harrigan and DeAnna Parker were part of the staff at the beekeeping station on Wednesday. The pair plan to do their capstone project on beekeeping together.\nThey enjoyed sharing their knowledge with the younger students and watching them get engaged with the subject.\n\"They're learning a bit of everything,\" said Harrigan. \"It's amazing and I get really happy when the kids ask a question.\"\nHarrigan noted that she didn't know much about ag before beginning at CCST, but finds the field fascinating.\n\"If I could recommend it to others, I would,\" Harrigan said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: June is National Dairy month\n\n June 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1453\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Dairy played an important part in my life, even though we never had more than two cows.Mom always took care of the cows because she said the boys were in a big hurry to finish and get \"out cruising.\" The easy part may have been \"milking\" because that was just the beginning. We had a cement building called the \"milk\" house, which had a small processing center where the fresh milk was poured into a long cylinder-shaped container on long legs called the separator (sounds like a WWE Wrestler).\nThere was a small glass window on the side that showed the cream separating from the milk as the hours passed. Mom monitored this carefully. Eventually, the cream was drained off and put in those two contraptions called \"hand cranked butter churns.\"\nWelcome Saturday morning — cartoons on the black and white, the sloshing sound of cream being churned and occasional groaning. This turned into a \"race,\" which led into hard lumps of butter being formed — finally.\nMom was prepared for the hard clumps to mix with salt, form into balls and press into her butter press. The butter was a beautiful shade of yellow-orange, and she pressed it into a beautiful cornflower design.\nMom wrapped each individually in wax paper and kept refrigerating. Usually by the next week, before we start all over, Mom sold some, gave some away to those in need or froze some.\nOh, we are not done yet. What about the milk portion of the separator?\nWell, this was strained well and put in pint, quart or gallon jars and kept refrigerated. We drank it, cooked with it, made ice cream, puddings, cakes, biscuits and much more — all in a day's work on the Hitchens Family Farm.\nHow our arms aren't the size of oak trees I'll never know.\n\"OLD WAY\" HOMEMADE BUTTER\nRaw milk sits out overnight. The following day, a wooden or brass skimmer is used to collect the cream that had risen to the top. The cream is then poured into a wooden butter churn. Churning separates the water from the fat particles in the cream. These particles fuse with each other and form larger fat globules, while the air is forced out of the mixture. Eventually the butter separates from the buttermilk. An outdoor temperature of 65 degrees is optimal; butter formed in about 20 minutes. On hot days, the butter churned is soft and keeps poorly, but on cold days it takes much longer to form. Once the buttermilk is poured off, the butter is rinsed with cold water and squeezed with wooden paddles to remove any extra moisture. At this point salt can be added, and then the butter is pressed into a wooden mold and stored for use.\n\"NEW WAY\" HOMEMADE BUTTER\n2 cups heavy whipping cream at room temperature; 1/8 — 1/4 tsp salt; a hand mixer, food processor or blender; fine mesh strainer.\nPour cream into a mixing bowl. If the cream fills the bowl more than halfway, make the butter in batches to reduce overflow and splatter. Starting with the mixer on low, gradually increase the speed to medium and continue mixing for 5 to 15 minutes. The variation in time is due to the amount and temperature of the cream. After a few minutes, you will have whipped cream. Keep mixing until it separates into small clumps of butter and buttermilk. Pour out the buttermilk through the mesh strainer into a separate mixing bowl (can be saved for baking) and squeeze out extra with the wooden spoon. Cover the butter with clean, cold water and continue to work with the spoon to remove any remaining buttermilk. Drain and repeat this process several times until the water runs clear. The more buttermilk you separate from the butter, the longer it will last. Add salt and work into the butter. Store the butter in a tightly sealed jar, plastic wrap, or wax paper in the fridge for up to two weeks. For honey butter add ¼ cup honey in the beginning.\nOLD FASHIONED HOMEMADE VANILLA ICE CREAM\n6 large eggs, 1 1/4 cups cane sugar, 4 tsps vanilla extract, 14 ounces sweetened condensed milk, 24 ounces evaporated milk, 1 tsp salt, 6 cups whole milk, 16 pounds ice, 3 cups rock salt.\nStart by creaming the eggs and the sugar together using a mixer. Then add the vanilla extract. Next, mix in the sweetened condensed milk, scraping all the ooey gooey liquid out of the can with a spatula. Add both cans of evaporated milk. Add in a good-sized dash of salt, which equals out to about a teaspoon, and mix everything together well. Pour the mixture into the metal canister of your ice cream maker. Finish topping off the canister with whole milk, making sure to fill it about 3/4 of the way full, leaving room for expansion as it freezes. Your metal canister should have a fill line. Put the lid on and place the metal canister down into the bucket of your ice cream maker. Crush a big bag of ice, gradually pouring ice around the canister. Tip: You can add up to a gallon of water if needed, as well. We sometimes do this because our motor will seize up. Adding a bit of water will help it keep turning.\nAdd 2-3 cups of rock salt as you add the ice, making sure to top it off with rock salt. Let the motor run until it stops. Once the ice cream is frozen, the motor on your ice cream maker will stop churning. Unplug it immediately. Wipe any excess ice or rock salt off the lid and out from around the top of the canister. Then remove the lid. Carefully remove the churning paddle. Serve the ice cream immediately. If you're not ready to serve it up just yet, you can always leave the lid on, remove the motor, top the canister off with ice, and place a towel or two over it to insulate it and keep it cold.\nHOMEMADE CHEESECAKE\nCrust: 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 10 whole graham crackers, crushed), 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, 6 tbsps (85g) melted butter, 1/8 tsp salt. Filling: two 8-ounce packages cream cheese at room temperature, 2/3 cup granulated sugar, 2 large eggs at room temperature, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract.\nSelect a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least nine inches and whose height is at least 1 1/4 inches. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. To make the crust: Stir together all the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined. Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides. To make the filling: Mix the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mix until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.\nHOMEMADE PEACH FROZEN YOGURT\n1 ¼ pound frozen peach slices, 1 cup sugar, ¾ cups heavy cream, 1 ¾ cups Greek yogurt, ¼ tsp salt + some extra, fresh peach slices from the bag.\nIn a medium saucepan, combine peaches and sugar. Cook over medium heat until peaches are softened, for about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the cream and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully transfer to a blender. Puree mixture until smooth. Pour mixture into a large bowl and chill in the refrigerator until cold, about 4 hours or overnight. Once chilled, whisk in yogurt and salt until smooth. Pour into the base of an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions until thick and frozen. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze for about 6 hours or until solid. Garnish with fresh peach slices just before serving, if desired.\nICE CREAM SANDWICH SUNDAES\n1 ½ — 2 cup vanilla or desired-flavor ice cream, 32 1.5 inches shortbread cookies, 2 small ripe pears or apples (peeled, cored, and finely chopped), 1 cup caramel ice cream topping, ⅓ cup chopped pecans or walnuts (toasted), whipped cream or frozen whipped dessert topping.\nPlace a small scoop of ice cream on the bottoms of half of the cookies. Top with remaining cookies, bottom sides down, pressing together lightly. Place it in an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve, up to 1 week. To serve, combine pears and caramel topping in a small saucepan. Heat over medium-low heat until pears start to soften, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove ice cream sandwiches from the freezer. Let's stand for about 5 minutes. Place 2 sandwiches in each of the 8 serving bowls. Top with caramel mixture, nuts, and whipped cream, if you like. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Calloway's garden almost covers her whole front yard.On Saturday, June 28, from 9 a.m. to noon, Calloway will welcome Caroline County residents to her home for a garden party with over 300 registered daylilies. She also has thousands of hybridized daylily seedlings, herbs, bulbs, asiatic lilies, poppies and more.\nThe gathering has become something of an annual tradition, Calloway said, giving her an opportunity to connect with her neighbors.\n\"This is the second time that I've advertised it, but I've done it I think four times,\" Calloway said. \"Last year was after two years of drought, and I decided not to do it anymore. But it rained so much this spring and it looks so wonderful, and I am so happy that I'm going to do it again.\"\nCalloway is a cafeteria worker at Greensboro Elementary School. When she is not putting smiles on children's faces, she is in the garden she has been developing for eight years.\n\"It started very small in 2017, and I had just started getting into daylilies. I went to a daylily farm in Clayton, Delaware, and she has over 5,000 registered plants,\" Calloway said.\nCalloway plans to register plants and name them in her family members' honors.\nWhile Calloway enjoys the event, she does say it's a bit overwhelming having a lot of people near her home, but this doesn't stop her from inviting them. Just two weeks ago, Calloway welcomed a group of students to her garden.\n\"One of my students dug a potato, made friends with a worm. It was all over the place, and I don't mind kids coming out here. It's great,\" Calloway said.\"\nCalloway will be selling items from her garden for prices between $5 and $15. She said the prices are low because she knows what it's like to be a single mother and get something very cheap.\n\"If I don't sell anything on Saturday, I don't care,\" Calloway said. \"This is more of a community thing, get to see a couple friends that I haven't seen in a while, and I'm very introverted and nerdy, but it's like this is the only time that I feel comfortable talking to people.\"\nIn addition to items for sale, Calloway will have free chocolate chip cookies and free daffodil bulbs.\nCalloway's garden is located on Cherry Lane about a mile past the Tuckahoe State Park camping entrance. Those looking to attend the event should look for a black and white plant sale sign. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Besides, the bison might just eat all of the above mentioned gifts.\n\"He'll be getting plenty of that,\" said Indy's owner, 83-year-old Dick Wildes of Hollywood, on the birthday treats the bison will receive.\nIndy declined to be interviewed for this story, instead choosing to munch corn.\nIndy was born July 4, 2015, at Summerseat Farm in Mechanicsville and was just three days old when its mother died.\n\"I'd never had that happen before,\" Wildes said, adding he never figured out why the mother died.\nThen there was the question about what to do with the newborn.\n\"I'd heard horror stories from people out west who had raised them [from birth],\" he said, \"They said, 'You never want to do that,' but when that baby came to me for help, what was I going to do? It was either put it down so it wouldn't suffer or try, and the result was good.\"\nThe bison was bottle-fed about four to six times a day by farm staff and Wildes, who had several bison at the farm for pasture management.\n\"Thankfully, we had the volunteers up there who pitched in to bottle feed as well,\" he said, adding Indy would follow people around everywhere, even into the feed room.\nSummerseat Farm held an open house about a month after Indy was born for the bison and other animals.\n\"I love animals so I wanted to go out there and see what the farm was about and meet the animals,\" said Tonya Freed of California, who added that Indy \"was adorable.\"\nThat same day, Freed inquired about volunteering at the farm and after her training, she helped with one of Indy's bottle feedings.\n\"Indy is very special,\" said Freed, who has been volunteering at the farm ever since.\nIndy's first birthday was a big event as well with balloons up and down the driveway and a homemade vegetable cake by Wildes.\nIndy shares the expansive Hollywood pasture, which includes a forest, pond, fresh water and a daily all-you-can-eat grass buffet, with Dozer, a dominant male.\nAnd the pair are a draw for the Land 'O Lake community walkers, golf carts and passing vehicles, many of whom stop to watch.\nWildes, who said he is \"very attached\" to Indy, will feed the bison grain and will follow Wildes wherever he goes.\nIt's an above-humid day and Indy is resting in a small, covered, shaded section of the farm to escape the incessant heat and biting insects, and it looks like the animal is in no mood to move.\nBut carrying a long loaf of crusty bread — Indy's favorite — Wildes softly repeats \"Come on ... come on … come on\" and soon enough, Indy trots over to the fence and even gives Wildes a kiss.\nWildes keeps both bison in the pasture, and across the road is another pasture with three cows, two of whom are a cross between bison and Hereford while the third is a cross between a bison and Angus. None of the animals are in danger of being harvested.\n\"They're just pets,\" he said of Fuzzy, Toro and Mamma Cow. \"But they don't follow me around like Indy does.\"\nWildes grew up in southern Prince George's County on a farm that produced corn, strawberries and other vegetables as well as tobacco.\nAfter graduating from Surrattsville High School in 1960, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Later, he worked for a printing company and, after eight years, he bought a printing company of his own in La Plata that he built into a \"good-sized facility\" with 30 employees, along with another in White Plains.\nHe retired after the 2002 tornado ripped through La Plata and destroyed the plant.\nPrior to that, he had bought the 20-acre Hollywood farm in 1971.\nIt was during a trip to Colorado decades ago that he first laid eyes on bison and was smitten instantly.\n\"They're majestic animals,\" he said of bison, which can reach speeds of up to 35 miles an hour and, according to an Internet search, typically live 15 to 20 years or even longer when in captivity.\nAnd, as America celebrates its own birthday, Indy will celebrate as well with its favorite foods, although Wildes said the bison will most certainly not wear a birthday hat. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Solar power and productive farmland can co-exist\n\n July 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 743\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n An ambitious, though some would suggest an unrealistic, \"green energy\" agenda for Maryland has been and is a top priority of a majority of the members in the Maryland General Assembly and Gov. Moore.During the final days of the 2025 General Assembly session, that agenda was advanced when Senate Bill 931, a bill with only one Senate sponsor from Montgomery County, was approved.\nUnderstanding the serious negative impact of this proposed new law on the Eastern Shore, every member of the General Assembly representing the Eastern Shore voted no on final passage of SB 931 in a bipartisan display of unity and solidarity.\nTheir efforts were thwarted by a super majority in both the Senate and House of Delegates where, as always, a minority may have their say, but the majority will always have their way.\nSB 931 was signed into law by Gov. Moore in late May and took effect on July 1.\nIn response to the final version of SB 931, a new advocacy group was launched.\nThe Farmers Alliance for Rural Maryland (FARM) is a grassroots organization of Maryland farmers and agriculture advocates committed to protecting and preserving Maryland's rural landscapes and way of life.\nAccording to its website, FARM intends to oppose eminent domain initiatives, state preemption of local zoning laws and any proposals that threaten the future of Maryland agriculture, such as commercial solar fields, data centers, battery storage, power lines and warehouse centers on zoned agricultural lands.\nEven before Gov. Moore signed SB 931 into law, FARM launched a petition drive using the provisions of Article XVI, Section 1, of the Maryland Constitution.\nThat article states: \"The people reserve to themselves power known as The Referendum, by petition to have submitted to the registered voters of the State, to approve or reject at the polls, any Act, or part of any Act of the General Assembly, if approved by the Governor, or, if passed by the General Assembly over the veto of the Governor.\"\nThe first step for SB 931 to be on a referendum on the next statewide general election ballot required FARM filing at least 20,053 validated petition signatures to the state Board of Elections by May 31.\nDespite best efforts by FARM leaders and volunteers, FARM narrowly missed meeting that required number by that deadline.\nThis matter is far from over.\nFollowing the failed petition drive, the leaders of FARM said they are not giving up the fight.\nSome will say any future FARM efforts on this matter, especially in the legislature, to repeal all or parts on this new law will be an exercise in futility.\nI strongly disagree.\nIt will not be easy. It can be done.\nA grassroots advocacy initiative, focused on the General Assembly and Gov. Moore to adjust the new law, could succeed especially when FARM already has a key grassroots resource in place.\nThat resource is the sizable number of voters who signed FARM's petition on SB 931.\nThese voters have already demonstrated support for and a commitment to FARM's views.\nThey can be mobilized in a grassroots campaign to deliver FARM's messages to legislators and the governor before and during the 2026 General Assembly session that is only seven months from now.\nThere are key positive messages FARM grassroots advocates can deliver early and often.\nFARM supports the concept of solar energy panels to generate electricity.\nFARM supports placing solar energy panels on sites other than agricultural land, e.g., brownfields, parking lots, rooftops, industrial sites, airport fields and median strips.\nFARM supports returning all land use planning decisions, including approvals of solar power infrastructure sitting back to their historic and proper place with local governments\nA 2016 decision by Chesapeake College to install solar panels over a parking lot on their campus Following that installation the college reported the solar panels produced enough power in one year to offset approximately 45 percent of the college's energy demand.\nChesapeake College's interim president at that time said, \"Solar energy has propelled our renewable energy production. In the first year, the array produced 2.25 million kilowatts of electricity at a cost of $106,000. This represents a savings of $85,000 off of grid prices. We anticipate similar savings on utility bills over the next 19 years, which doesn't include any additional solar installations constructed.\"\nLast but not least, the Baltimore based Abell Foundation offers the following thought in their report Getting Solar Siting Right: \"Maryland has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to increase its renewable energy capacity and protect vital agricultural land.\"\nNext year, with \"out of the box\" thinking, the General Assembly and the governor can do both. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'An amazing turnout' — Talbot County Fair back once again\n\n July 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 451\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot County Fair came back this past weekend for its 42nd year of showcasing Maryland's state sport of jousting, providing games galore, highlighting many food vendors, and hosting a multitude of animal shows and exhibits.The fair ran from Thursday, July 10, to Saturday, July 12. Each day offered something different and exciting, like the pygmy goat show on Friday and the annual watermelon eating contest on Saturday.\nChairman of the Talbot County Fair Michelle McCulley said the watermelon eating contest was her favorite part of the weekend.\n\"That was so much fun to watch,\" McCulley said.\nYoung farmers from 4-H manned the games booths, sold fair gear and showed off their animals each day, an opportunity for the agriculture students to test their skills.\nFormer 4-H member and 2025 pygmy goat show winner Stacey Thompson has been showing animals since she was 10 years old. Thompson, now 36, is a mentor to many of the young 4-Hers at the fair.\nAs the leader of the Just Kidding Around 4-H Club, Thompson said she enjoys returning to her roots and sharing her experiences with the younger generations.\n\"A lot of these little kids you see running around I've actually trained,\" Thompson said.\nThompson proudly watched the young farmers show their goats after she won first place in her heat.\nMcCulley said she was very happy with the weather conditions and turnout of this year's event.\n\"We really lucked out with the weather. There was no rain, and I don't know if that's the first time, but it's a miracle,\" she said. \"So I think that really helped us. We had a really good turnout, better than we have the past couple years.\"\nThe annual watermelon eating contest drew the largest turnout of all the events of the weekend. The competition was divided by age bracket.\nEveryone had one minute to eat as much of their watermelon as possible, except for the 21 and older crowd, who had 45 seconds. Juice dripped from the sides of participants' mouths as the judge yelled, \"drop your watermelons.\"\nFirst and second place competitors received prizes, and everyone else received purple ribbons. First time Talbot County Fair goer Gabby Hernandez came out victorious in the 21 and older category but said she was initially super nervous. \"I was like, making a whole plan,\" Hernandez said.\nHernandez, who ate her watermelon slice down to the rind, beat her husband and all the other men at the table. \"This is my first time. I've never done anything like that before,\" she said about the eating contest.\nThe fair will be back around the same time next year. \"It was an amazing turnout, and all the money goes back to the 4-H and supporting youth projects and learning,\" McCulley said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore's Buy Local Cookout to kick off Maryland Buy Local Week.The annual event celebrates the state's diverse agricultural scene by featuring restaurants that partner with Maryland farmers and watermen.\nFreshly shucked oysters, spicy mala Maryland crispy blue catfish strips, a flank steak with blue cheese and watermelon, and so many more mouth watering bites were up for grabs at the evening's cookout.\nThe Eastern Shore was represented well, with dishes ranging from delicious pan fried local soft shell crab from Bistro St. Michaels, to a beautiful and tasty Maryland Memela from Modern Stone Age Kitchen in Chestertown and a refreshing blue catfish ceviche from Quarter Acre Farm Eats, whose farm is located in Greensboro but can also be found at Easton's farmers market on Saturdays.\nAndrea Davis-Cetina with Quarter-Acre Farms said they were told two days prior to the event that Moore does not like raw tomatoes or cilantro, the main components of their dish, but Moore tried the blue catfish ceviche anyway and loved it. \"He even made a comment that he could eat a big bowl of it,\" Davis-Cetina said.\nRoyal Oak Catering Company, based out of Talbot County, partnered with Bistro St. Michaels for the event. Director of Royal Oak Catering Laura Poole said the event was a huge success and the governor enjoyed the soft shell crab the team served.\n\"I think it's a great way to get the Eastern Shore recognized and to have people pulled to come over to the restaurants there,\" Poole said.\nOn the opposite side of the food stations, the Department of Agriculture set up educational booths on spaying and neutering pets, a booth of animal facts called \"true or poo,\" and other agricultural resources.\n\"I thought it was very well organized, and I felt like everybody rallied in the heat,\" Poole said.\nMoore and attendees had the opportunity to visit each stall to try the local fare. Guests were given a small red festival ticket to vote for their favorite dish, and at the end of the night, Faidley's Seafood of Baltimore came out on top with their crispy Maryland catfish sliders.\nMaryland's Buy Local Week takes place from Thursday, July 17, to Sunday, July 27. Marylanders are encouraged to buy at least one local food product a day during this week.\n\"You buy your local food, and you snap a picture, and then send it (to the Department of Agriculture) or post it on social media and use the hashtag '#localchallenge.' I think participants are going to be entered into some prizes,\" said Maryland Department of Agriculture Communications Director Jessica Hackett.\nVisit the MDA website for further information on Buy Local Week.

    "content": "Kent County 4-H Fair celebrates youth, farming and fun\n\n July 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 721\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TOLCHESTER, Md. — The Kent County 4-H Fair drew crowds July 16-19 with animals, contests, food and fun, showcasing the dedication and spirit of local 4-H youth.The fair officially opened to the public Wednesday evening with a prayer from Pastor Josh Rendulic of Hope Fellowship Church, honoring the late Pastor Bill Carroll of Still Pond United Methodist Church.\nThe ceremony also introduced the county's 4-H clubs, including Bits and Bridles, Kent Clover Calf, Fuzzy Tales and Shiny Scales, Kent Puppy Pals, and Kent 4-H Triple Shots.\nThe fair is a time for 4-H members to present the hard work they've invested throughout the year, judged by experts across a variety of categories. Livestock competitions — featuring cows, pigs, goats, rabbits, horses, ducks, dogs and chickens — continued into the weekend.\n\"It's hard work,\" said Beth Hill, principal agent associate for 4-H Youth Development in Kent County, \"but it's also fun for participants and spectators alike. Our 4-H really shined in their project work and in all the other things we look for: teamwork, cooperation, responsibility, sportsmanship, character — even empathy and joy for others.\"\nThe 2025 fair theme was \"Blue Jeans and 4-H Dreams.\" New to the lineup this year was a 4-H alumni showmanship event hosted by Kent County Young Farmers, along with the return of the lawn tractor contest.\nAnimals were a major highlight. Livestock were shown in the main staging arena, while rabbits and poultry had their own exhibition space. Glossy coats, straight backs, brushed fur — even moody horses — were all on display as handlers aimed to show their animals in peak form.\nThursday afternoon brought out tractor enthusiasts for the lawn tractor obstacle course. Under the direction of instructors Mitch and Drew Debnam, youth demonstrated their ability to maneuver a tractor pulling a two-wheel trailer through a series of challenges. The event even drew a visit from vintage tractor puller and former winner.\n\"I took off work just to come out and support these young fellas,\" he said.\nOn Friday, volunteer Jaime Orndorff hosted the fourth Youth Goose and Duck Call competition, judged by bird outfitter Steve Goss. Plaques for winners were provided by Mark Kwiatkowski of All For A Bird. Orndorff expressed gratitude for the support of her sponsors and contributors.\nInside the exhibit hall, judges evaluated everything from cakes to houseplants, herb arrangements, artwork, photography and even corn stalks. Select baked goods were auctioned off Saturday evening, with proceeds benefiting Kent County 4-H and the Kent Ag Center.\nThroughout the week, fairgoers enjoyed police K-9 demonstrations, archery, turkey call contests, a cornhole tournament, fashion shows and a carnival of rides and games. Youth from programs like Horizons of Kent and Queen Anne's, as well as local parks and recreation camps, attended as part of their summer activities.\nEach night featured live music from performers including Robert MacFarland, Quinn Arnold, Kevin Kemp and the Del-Mar Band. Wednesday night brought out dancers for a session led by local line dance instructor Minnie Maloney.\nFood and refreshments were a big draw, with vendors offering fried treats, funnel cake, kettle corn and ice cream. Each evening also featured a full meal sponsored by local businesses, including crab cakes, barbecue beef and grilled chicken.\nOne of the most anticipated events came Friday night: the greased pig contest. About 200 people surrounded the fence to watch children — from toddlers to teens — chase and try to catch squirming piglets sponsored by local businesses. The event was emceed by Sherrie Spray, who kept the crowd entertained with lively commentary.\nSaturday featured the return of the Power Wheels Demolition Derby for children ages 3 to 5. Toddlers, seated in 12-volt toy cars, delighted the crowd as they popped balloons in a playful smash-up competition.\n\"As always, we ended with the tug-of-war,\" Orndorff said. \"It really is something for everyone.\"\nHill said the fair went smoothly overall.\n\"I will say we have the highest 4-H membership in over a decade, and it's very exciting going forward,\" she said.\nVolunteer coordinator Valerie Mason estimated attendance at over 3,000 — slightly down from last year, likely due to the heat. She noted that gate proceeds support the Kent Ag Center and help reinvest in the fairgrounds.\nCompetition results will be posted online and published in a future edition of the Kent County News.\nHill thanked the community for their support. \"We're grateful to everyone who helped make this fair a wonderful experience.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Kent County 4-H Fair celebrates youth, farming and fun\n\n July 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 682\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TOLCHESTER — The Kent County 4-H Fair drew crowds July 16-19 with animals, contests, food and fun, showcasing the dedication and spirit of local 4-H youth.The fair officially opened to the public Wednesday, July 16, with a prayer from Pastor Josh Rendulic of Hope Fellowship Church, honoring the late Pastor Bill Carroll of Still Pond United Methodist Church.\nThe ceremony introduced the county's 4-H clubs, including Bits and Bridles, Kent Clover Calf, Fuzzy Tales and Shiny Scales, Kent Puppy Pals and Kent 4-H Triple Shots.\nThe fair is a time for 4-H members to present the hard work they've invested throughout the year, judged by experts across a variety of categories. Livestock competitions — featuring cows, pigs, goats, rabbits, horses, ducks, dogs and chickens — continued into the weekend.\n\"It's hard work,\" said Beth Hill, principal agent associate for 4-H Youth Development in Kent County, \"but it's also fun for participants and spectators alike. Our 4-H really shined in their project work and in all the other things we look for: teamwork, cooperation, responsibility, sportsmanship, character — even empathy and joy for others.\"\nThe 2025 fair theme was \"Blue Jeans and 4-H Dreams.\" New to the lineup this year was a 4-H alumni showmanship event hosted by Kent County Young Farmers, along with the return of the lawn tractor contest.\nAnimals were a major highlight. Livestock were shown in the main staging arena, while rabbits and poultry had their own exhibition space. Glossy coats, straight backs, brushed fur — even moody horses — were on display as handlers aimed to show their animals in peak form.\nThursday afternoon brought out tractor enthusiasts for the lawn tractor obstacle course. Under the direction of instructors Mitch and Drew Debnam, youth demonstrated their ability to maneuver a tractor pulling a two-wheel trailer through a series of challenges. The event even drew a visit from a vintage tractor puller and former winner.\n\"I took off work just to come out and support these young fellas,\" he said.\nOn Friday, volunteer Jaime Orndorff hosted the fourth Youth Goose and Duck Call competition, judged by bird outfitter Steve Goss. Plaques for winners were provided by Mark Kwiatkowski of All For A Bird. Orndorff expressed gratitude for the support of her sponsors and contributors.\nInside the exhibit hall, judges evaluated everything from cakes to houseplants, herb arrangements, artwork, photography and even corn stalks. Select baked goods were auctioned off Saturday evening, with proceeds benefiting Kent County 4-H and the Kent Ag Center.\nThroughout the week, fairgoers enjoyed police K-9 demonstrations, archery, turkey call contests, a cornhole tournament, fashion shows and a carnival of rides and games. Youth from programs like Horizons of Kent and Queen Anne's, as well as local parks and recreation camps, attended as part of their summer activities.\nEach night featured live music from performers including Robert MacFarland, Quinn Arnold, Kevin Kemp and the Del-Mar Band. Wednesday night brought out dancers for a session led by local line dance instructor Minnie Maloney.\nFood and refreshments were a big draw, with vendors offering fried treats, funnel cake, kettle corn and ice cream. Each evening featured a full meal sponsored by local businesses, including crab cakes, barbecue beef and grilled chicken.\nOne of the most anticipated events came Friday night: the greased pig contest. About 200 people surrounded the fence to watch children — from toddlers to teens — chase and try to catch squirming piglets sponsored by local businesses. Master of ceremonies Sherrie Spray kept the crowd entertained with lively commentary.\nSaturday featured the return of the Power Wheels Demolition Derby for children ages 3 to 5. Toddlers, seated in 12-volt toy cars, delighted the crowd as they popped balloons in a playful smash-up competition.\n\"As always, we ended with the tug-of-war,\" Orndorff said. \"It really is something for everyone.\"\nHill said the fair went smoothly overall.\n\"I will say we have the highest 4-H membership in over a decade, and it's very exciting going forward,\" she said.\nVolunteer coordinator Valerie Mason estimated attendance at over 3,000 — slightly down from last year, likely due to the heat. She noted that gate proceeds support the Kent Ag Center and help reinvest in the fairgrounds. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Keeping history alive': Eastern Shore threshing and steam show marks 65 years\n\n August 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Caroline \n \n 481\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FEDERALSBURG — In 1961, Jim Layton and some neighbors gathered off of Route 313 to thresh wheat using one steam engine. That modest demonstration of farm work quickly gained popularity. It's taken a life of its own for the last 65 years.The Eastern Shore Threshermen & Collectors Association hosted the 65th annual Wheat Threshing, Steam & Gas Engine Show over the weekend, drawing hundreds to the showgrounds outside Federalsburg.\nTrish Layton Todd, Jim Layton's daughter and the association's president, reflected on the original gathering in 1961. Farming technology has modernized the process in the decades since, but every year, the Threshermen Association puts on the threshing show for locals and visitors.\n\"Keeping history alive,\" Layton Todd said of the event's purpose. \"We try to do it with working demonstrations, to show the wheat threshing. Now we have the modern combine. Before you had that, it was labor-intensive work because you had to do a lot of it by hand. And then of course the threshing, you had threshing days, where that's all you did.\n\" ... (We are) hoping to teach people about it because it's good to know where you come from.\"\nClassic steam engines, tractors and other farm equipment were on display Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Misty conditions halted the wheat threshing demonstrations Friday, but not the rest of the weekend.\nAttendees enjoyed live music, food, a flea market, lawn and tractor games and more. Layton Todd pointed out how vendors and tent operators were more than happy to show event-goers the history of different traditional techniques, such as blacksmithing.\n\"Most of the people, if they're here and they have something they're exhibiting and showing, they like for you to show interest and stop and talk,\" she said.\nMark Williams, a blacksmith from Snow Hill, has been coming to the steam show since the mid-1990s. He first did it as a favor to a friend, but it's since become tradition.\nAs he finished up his blacksmithing on Friday and packed up, Williams said some of his creations take hours or days.\n\"Things that are a challenge for me to design and make are the ones I like the most,\" Williams said.\n\"I make hearts out of horseshoes,\" he added.\nElsewhere, some attendees took to miniature tractors to race in a friendly competition.\nEach day, the association hosted a parade in the evening, showcasing classic steam engines from around the country, as well as tractors and other farm equipment. Many kids and teenagers rode on the tractors during the parade.\nLayton Todd said a key aspect of the event is getting the youth involved and understanding the history and evolution of farming.\nShe noted that the Eastern Shore Thresherman & Collectors Association is 100% volunteer-based. The group has forged ahead to organize the annual show — this year's shirts for volunteers proclaimed, \"65 years ... and still steaming.\"\nThe 66th annual Wheat Threshing, Steam & Gas Engine Show is slated for Aug. 7-9, 2026. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Combined, over 1,400 farms make up the agricultural economy and generate more than $294 million in revenue annually in Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne's Counties.\n\"Agriculture has always played a significant role in our local economy,\" said Susan O'Neill, executive director of the USRC. \"Through targeted programs and strong partnerships, the USRC is dedicated to supporting local farms and agribusinesses as they plant roots, grow, and thrive, ensuring a strong future for our region.\"\nDeveloped in partnership with the Maryland Agricultural and Resource-Based Industry Development Corporation, the Incentive Fund supports food and fiber-producing farms in the Upper Shore region by providing access to capital. Through the program, USRC provides a 5% equity contribution toward eligible projects that are financed through MARBIDCO loan programs, giving farmers in Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne's County a greater chance of securing financial support.\n\"This partnership with the Upper Shore Regional Council has proven to be an effective way to increase access to capital for farmers in the region,\" said MARBIDCO Executive Director Steve McHenry. \"By combining our loan programs with the Upper Shore Agricultural Equity Incentive Matching Fund, we've been able to leverage an additional $4.5 million in commercial lending, which gives more producers, especially young and beginning farmers, a stronger chance to succeed in the Upper Shore Region.\"\nMARBIDCO's loan programs are tailored to meet the diverse needs of Maryland's agricultural industry. With USRC's assistance, farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs in the Upper Shore can access a range of financing programs that support everything from equipment purchases and working capital to aquaculture, energy efficiency, and specialty crop production.\nFor more information about the Upper Shore Agricultural Equity Incentive Matching Fund and how to apply, visit the program page on the USRC website. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hog heaven: Gracie's pigs are top tier at local fair\n\n August 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Life \n \n 354\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Congratulations go out to 18-year-old Constance \"Gracie\" Troyer for a successful performance at the Kent County Fair last month. Her swine Novalee was awarded grand champion among market hogs.Novalee started out winning first among heavyweights. Then Randy, Troyer's other hog, was awarded first among middleweights. At the final showdown, it was between Novalee, Randy, and Laurel Clarke's lightweight champion hog, Diva.\nJudge Kelsey Zepp's decision was Novalee, exclaiming one hog stood out among the others throughout the competition.\nTroyer's mother, Stacie was among her daughter's cheering campaign and beamed, \"Proud momma here! She has worked so hard.\"\nTroyer exclaimed she always did well in past competitions but was shocked that both Randy and Novalee went home winners.\nThe mixed breed hogs can hold their snouts up high as the best there is in 2025.\nTroyer pointed out the judge looks for a specific musculature among heavy weights and for middle weight Randy, the same kind of structure just slightly leaner. Zepp also looks for how clean they are and basically the potential of a quality market pig.\nHaving prize-winning hogs requires dedication. For Novalee and Randy, training started around January. Troyer walked them every day to build stamina, washed their coats making sure there were no yellow circles and ensured they had clean water.\nRecently they have found a quality feed that works for them too — Sunglow — which provides a balance of carbohydrates, amino acids, innovative ingredients, active nutrient supply, and show micronutrients.\nAll this prepared before under the bright lights of the fair, the swine were led by their handlers around the ring with pig sticks to encourage their utmost cooperation.\nThe prize was taken back home to Harmony Acres in Kennedyville, where Novalee and Randy and the Troyer family could get a little rest.\nTroyer, a graduate of Queen Anne's County High School, enjoys learning, competing and making friends in 4-H. She has one more year at the fair and will be attending Chesapeake College in the fall pursuing an early childhood teaching degree.\n\"This was a very cool experience,\" she remarked.\nSo what rewards do the grand champion hogs get?\n\"Just some street-cred around here,\" Stacie joked. \"No...correction on that...some fair-cred.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Pumpkin patch fun and great recipes\n\n September 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: News \n \n 1455\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Local farmers have started picking pumpkins and preparing a section of the farm for the annual pumpkin and cornfield maze.Kids of all ages love this maze, decorated with scarecrows, cornrows leading to dead ends until the correct path is selected. Decorations using pumpkins of all sizes and fall flowers line the paths making a beautiful scene.\nIn different areas set aside are many sizes of fall plants and flowers for sale, along with your choice of pumpkins. Fall has always been my favorite season because of the beautiful decorations available from the farms.\nMy grandson works part time on a pumpkin farm and enjoys meeting the kids and adults who visit. Both young and older folks enjoy the games, the walks and picking those pumpkins for decorating the yard and home.\nThe pumpkin is a Fall staple in North America for both cooking and decorating. Growing pumpkins involves growing the seeds in warm soil and nurturing the vines. Picking the pumpkins requires very carefully cutting at the vines stem for longer storage.\nA farmer friend of mine said he makes sure his workers leave at least two to four inches of stem on each one and handle the pumpkins very carefully to avoid bruising as the bruised pumpkin has a very short shelf life.\nIn the kitchen, the pumpkin is versatile — used in everything from pies and soup to preserves. The nutritional values include low calorie, high fiber and rich in vitamins.\nPUMPKIN BREAD PUDDING\n1 lb French bread, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 3 eggs, 2 cups half and half, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp allspice, 1 15-oz can unsweetened pumpkin, 1/2 cup golden raisins, 1/2 cup chopped pecans.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly butter a casserole dish — set aside. In a large mixing bowl gently tear apart French bread into small pieces. Sprinkle sugar over the bread. In a separate bowl lightly beat the eggs, add half and half with ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Mix in pumpkin. Combine with bread. In a small bowl, mix together raisins with pecans — set aside. In the prepared casserole dish pour only half of the bread mixture. Dump half of the raisin-pecan mixture on top. Pour the remaining bread mixture over the raisin/nut mixture. Smooth out the top and dump the remaining raisin mixture on top. Bake in a preheated oven for 25 to 35 minutes or until firm and lightly browned. Best if served warm with whipped cream.\nPUMPKIN CAKE\nThis cake is easy to make, and you can make your own favorite frosting, buy one at the store or serve without frosting using whipped cream or ice cream instead.\n4 eggs, 2 cups sugar, 1 cup vegetable oil, 1 can pumpkin, 2 cups flour, 2 tsps baking powder, 2 tsps ground cinnamon, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp ground ginger.\nPreheat the oven to 360 degrees. In a mixing bowl place eggs, mix well and add sugar. Beat while adding vegetable oil, pumpkin, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt and ginger. Pour into a jelly roll pan or loaf pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Frost when cooled.\nFOOLPROOF PIE CRUST\n4 cups flour, 1 1/2 cups shortening, 1 tbsp sugar, dash of salt, 1 beaten egg, 1/2 cup cold water, 1 tbsp vinegar.\nBlend flour, shortening, sugar, and salt. Then mix together egg, cold water and vinegar. Mix both sets of ingredients together until you have a smooth dough. This recipe will make at least six single crusts. You can use the amount of crust you need today and the remaining dough can be frozen, wrapped tightly. Freeze the dough into single rolls. I never freeze the rolls any longer than 30 to 40 days.\nPUMPKIN PIE\nNow for my mom's favorite pumpkin pie recipe ,but I must share a story with you beforehand.\nYou see, my mom had nine sons. Each year, when pumpkin picking time came, Mom would get my oldest brother to stop at the \"liquor store\" to get a very small bottle of whiskey for making mincemeat pie filling and to make her pumpkin pies. No one was to know this but my sister, myself, Mom and the brother who purchased the bottle. He did not consume alcohol, so he did not disclose the location. My sister and I also did not drink, so no problem.\nAlright here we go.\n2 cups pumpkin pulp, 1 1/2 cups milk, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1 tbsp melted butter, 2 well-beaten eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp molasses, 2 tbsps whiskey.\nMix together thoroughly pumpkin pulp, milk, salt, ginger, allspice, butter, eggs, sugar, cinnamon and molasses. Mix in whiskey. Pour into a single nine-inch unbaked pie shell and bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes. Enjoy.\nCRUSTLESS PUMPKIN PIE\nI have made this pie many times in the past years. Not only does it taste great, but it is so easy to make.\n1 15-oz can pumpkin puree, 1 14-oz can sweetened condensed milk, 2 beaten eggs, 2 tsps pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp salt.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Mix together pumpkin puree with sweetened condensed milk, eggs, pumpkin pie spice and salt. Mix well and pour into a greased nine-inch pie plate. Bake for 15 minutes, turn oven to 350 degrees and bake another 30 to 35 minutes or until the inserted knife comes out clean. Serve plain or with your favorite topping.\nPUMPKIN PANCAKES\n1 3/4 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 1/2 tsps ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups canned pumpkin puree, 2 large eggs, 1/2 cup milk.\nMix dry ingredients together in a large bowl. In a separate bowl whisk wet ingredients together and then mix them together. In lined muffin tins, fill mixture to the top. Bake in a preheated 425-degree oven for 5 minutes and turn heat back to 350 degrees and bake another 16 to 17 minutes longer until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Frosting is optional.\nBAKED PUMPKIN DONUTS\n2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tsps pumpkin pie spice, 2 tsps baking powder, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 15-oz can pumpkin puree, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/3 cup vegetable oil, 4 tbsps (1/2 stick) melted unsalted butter, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 3 large eggs. TOPPING: 3/4 cup sugar, 2 tsps ground cinnamon, 3 tbsps unsalted butter melted.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Whisk the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder and salt together in a medium bowl. Beat the pumpkin puree, sugar, vegetable oil, butter, vanilla and eggs and together in another large bowl until smooth. Add the flour mixture to the pumpkin mixture and beat until just combined. Fill three 6-cup nonstick doughnut pans with the batter so that each mold is almost full. Smooth the tops with a moistened finger. Bake the doughnuts until a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Invert the doughnuts onto a cooling rack.\nFor the topping: Stir the sugar and cinnamon together in a shallow bowl. Working one at a time, brush the doughnuts all over with butter, then dip them in the cinnamon sugar to coat. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nPUMPKIN SPICE PROTEIN MUFFINS WITH BUTTERSCOTCH CHIPS\nThis next recipe is one of my daughter in law Shannon, and has become one our families favorites, plus it is healthy.\n1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats, 1 cup pumpkin puree, 1 cup Greek yogurt, 2 large eggs, 1/2 packed cup vanilla flavored protein powder, 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, pinch of sea salt, 1/2 cup butterscotch chips.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Add the oats to a blender or food processor and process until a flour forms (15-20 seconds). Add the pumpkin, Greek yogurt, eggs, protein powder, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt and blend again until well combined. Stir in the butterscotch chips. Pour into 12 greased muffin liners. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. 25 minutes will be a little moist while 30 minutes won't be as moist. Enjoy.\nPUMPKIN CHEESECAKE\nThis cheesecake is absolutely delicious. You can buy a premade crust or use the easy recipe included here.\n1 cup pumpkin puree, 3 beaten eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup sour cream, 2 tbsps cornstarch, 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 8 oz cream cheese.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix together one cup pumpkin puree with beaten eggs, sugar, sour cream, cornstarch, pumpkin pie spice and cream cheese. Pour into the prepared crust, leaving about 1/4 inch space at the top. Bake for 45 minutes. Remove and let cool for four hours. Top with whipped cream. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Country Cooking: Sweet Potato Day on the farm\n\n October 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1484\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It was usually a cool, crisp morning as the rule of the farmers was \"dig the sweet potatoes after the first frost.\"Days before, the baskets would be pulled out and the space in the shed prepared for storage. Mom would make a large pot of vegetable beef soup and have freshly made biscuits ready.\nThe tractor had the flat trailer attached, and the boys climbed on board. Off to the field they would go. No music to listen to or cell phones to talk on — just country folks doing the seasonal Saturday morning \"thang.\"\nAs the tractor returned to the shed the filled baskets were lifted off next to piles of empty baskets, the sorting began — the sweet potatoes were placed in the empty baskets by their size.\nThe large ones for steaming for pies and bread, the medium ones for baking and the small ones for a quick pan of biscuits and to give to families smaller than ours who only wanted \"enough for a taste.\"\nWhen the work was done, and the delicious smells of freshly made soup filled the air, we all stepped into the kitchen where the big table was set with bowls, soup spoons and dishes of homemade butter. The hungry crowd quickly filled the seats.\nGrace was said, biscuits taken out of the oven, bowls of soup passed around — Mom standing, watching with a smile on her face.\nHowever, my sister and I would stand with scowls on our faces at the number of dishes to be washed, dried and put away. Saturdays on the farm, folks.\nAs we get closer to Thanksgiving, I will include Mom's sweet potato pie recipe.\nFor this first one today, we are taking a trip to Memphis. One of Elvis's favorite dishes is what's called Red hot Southern sweet potatoes.\nRED HOT SOUTHERN SWEET POTATOES\n3 ½ pounds sweet potatoes (peeled and cubed), ¼ cup butter or margarine (melted), ½ cup packed brown sugar, 1 ¼ cups cinnamon red hot candies, ¾ cup water, 1 package miniature marshmallows.\nPlace the sweet potatoes into a large saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook over medium heat until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain water, and place potatoes in a large casserole dish. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, stir together the butter, brown sugar, red hot candies and water. Pour over the sweet potatoes in the dish. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until sweet potatoes are soft, and the candies are melted. After this, you may top with marshmallows and return the dish to the oven for 10 minutes to toast them.\nTOASTED SWEET POTATOES\n2 pounds sweet potatoes (about 4 medium), 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, black pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees. Dice the sweet potatoes into 3/4-inch cubes, leaving the skin on. In a large bowl, mix together the sweet potatoes with the olive oil, garlic powder, and salt. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the sweet potatoes on top in an even layer. Bake for about 25 minutes, until the cubes are tender and browned on the bottom. Serve warm. Store leftovers refrigerated. Make ahead instructions: Make up to three days in advance and reheat in a 350-degree oven.\nSWEET POTATO SALAD\n3 large sweet potatoes (peeled and cubed), 1 small red onion (thinly sliced into half moons), 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, salt, freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/2 cup crumbled feta, 1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley. FOR THE DRESSING: 2 tbsps apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp Dijon mustard, 1 tbsp honey, 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp ground paprika, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss sweet potatoes and red onion in oil then season with salt and pepper. Distribute them evenly on a sheet in a single layer. Bake until tender, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes then transfer to a large bowl. Meanwhile, make dressing: In a small bowl or in a medium liquid measuring cup, whisk together vinegar, mustard, honey and spices. Gradually pour in oil, whisking constantly until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper. Toss sweet potatoes with dressing, cranberries, feta and parsley. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nINSTANT POT SWEET POTATO CASSEROLE\n3 pounds sweet potatoes (peeled, cut into three-inch cubes), 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, 3 tbsps maple syrup, 1/4 cup unsalted butter, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla, 2 1/2 cups pecans (chopped), 2 cups mini marshmallows.\nPlace the cubed sweet potatoes into the cooking vessel and pour in enough water to cover the potatoes. Select Manuel/Mode at 400 degrees, and set the time to 30 minutes. Bring to a boil. Using the handle grips remove the pot from the heat, drain the excess water and place it on the countertop protector. Add the sugar, salt, vanilla extract and butter. Using a masher, mix until smooth. Using a spatula spread the mashed potato, making sure you have an even layer, top with a layer of pecan and on top a layer of mini marshmallows. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. When the preheating time is done, place the cooking vessel into the oven and bake uncovered for 30-35 minutes or until the marshmallows are golden brown. Remove the cooking vessel using the handle grips and place it on the countertop protector. Serve and enjoy.\nCRISPY SWEET POTATO FRIES\n1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 3 large sweet potatoes.\nIn a bowl combine salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder and cinnamon. Set this dry mixture aside to use at the end. Wash sweet potatoes and halve each potato lengthwise. Slice into 1/4 inch sticks. In a large pot, heat canola oil. In batches, cook fries in oil for 5 minutes or until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with the cinnamon, cayenne mixture. My grandson Mason loves to dip his in maple syrup.\nSWEET POTATO BISCUITS\nCook sweet potatoes, cool, peel and mash well. To 1 cup of the potatoes, add 2 1/2 cups biscuit mix, 1/3 cup softened butter and 1/2 cup milk. Mix until a soft dough is obtained. Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface and shape into a ball; knead three or four times — do not over-knead. Press out to a flatten circle and cut into two-inch rounds. Arrange biscuits with edges touching on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in a pre-heated 450-degree oven for 10 — 12 minutes or until golden.\nSWEET POTATO CHIPS\n2 large sweet potatoes, 2 tbsps olive oil, 1/4 tsp sea salt.\nPreheat the oven to 250 degrees and position the oven rack in the center of the oven. Rinse and dry your sweet potatoes thoroughly and slice them as uniformly thin as possible (1/8 inch thick slices). If you have a mandolin, use it. Otherwise, use a very sharp knife to get these uniformly thin. Know that chips that are too thick in parts won't crisp up all the way. Still delicious, just not \"chip\" crispiness. Toss slices in a touch of olive oil to lightly coat, then sprinkle with salt. Lay out in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for about 1 hour 30 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes, flipping chips once at halfway point to ensure even cooking. Thickness of slices will impact cooking time. Check at 10 minute intervals during the second hour of cooking to ensure they aren't burning. Remove once crisp and golden brown. Some may feel a little tender in the middle but take them out and let them rest for 10 minutes or so to crisp up before sampling. Serve immediately.\nTWICE BAKED SWEET POTATO WITH GROUND TURKEY\nHere is another unconventional sweet potato recipe that my son John loves to make.\n1 pound ground turkey, 2 large sweet potatoes, 1/4 cup hot sauce (John uses Buffalo Wild Wings Mild sauce), 1 yellow onion (diced), 1 garlic clove (minced), 2 tsps chipotle chili powder, 1 tsp ground red pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp paprika, olive oil, salt and pepper.\nPreheat your oven to 425 degrees. Cut your sweet potatoes in half lengthwise and put them face down on a cookie sheet. Put in the oven to cook for about 25-30 minutes depending how thick they are. You will know when they are done if they are easy to push on, on the skin side. If you pull them out early and the inside doesn't come out easily with a spoon, you'll need to cook them a bit longer. While your sweet potatoes cook, start a skillet over medium-high heat. Add a bit of olive oil to the hot pan then add your garlic and onions to start cooking down. Once the onions are translucent, add the ground turkey and use a large spoon to break it up to help cook it a bit quicker. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Spotted lanternflies are everywhere — what you can do",

    "content": "Spotted lanternflies are everywhere — what you can do\n\n October 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARY BURKE Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 776\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Over the past few months, invasive spotted lanternflies have emerged in massive numbers across Maryland.Originating in Asia, the spotted lanternfly is an invasive pest that feeds on a variety of plants. The lanternfly was first detected in the United States in Berks County, Pennsylvania, in 2014. It is suspected that the species was accidentally carried into the United States through an international shipment of stone.\nAlthough the insect first appeared in the United States over a decade ago, it has only been seen in Maryland since 2018. Since then, the species has spread throughout 20 out of 23 counties in the state, according to the Maryland Department of Agriculture.\nWhat harm do they pose?\nSpotted lanternflies are not directly dangerous to humans. Although their flitting around can be irritating, the insects do not sting or bite. There also has not been evidence of spotted lanternflies being poisonous to eat or being dangerous to pets.\nHowever, because they feed on plant sap, spotted lanternflies pose a threat to the well-being of a number of plant species in Maryland. Grapes are particularly at risk of harm: their feeding risks killing off grapevines. They also enjoy feeding on maple and willow trees.\nWhen feeding, lanternflies excrete honeydew, a substance which is known to grow fungus. This \"sooty mold\" fungus will not directly kill a plant, but in large quantities, may stifle photosynthesis by blocking its access to sunlight. The fungal growth may also prevent crops from being sold.\n\"They're seeing damage, almost permanent damage, to things underneath of the trees,\" Jessica Boyles, the coordinator for the Maryland Department of Agriculture's spotted lanternfly response program, told Capital News Service.\nBoyles mentioned that she has heard reports of damage to landscaping, siding, and outdoor equipment such as grills and furniture due to honeydew and sooty mold.\nExcess honeydew may also pose another threat: attracting unpopular stinging insects, such as wasps, hornets and honeybees.\nWhy are they everywhere?\nSpotted lanternflies are notorious for hitchhiking to new places on cars and trains.\nBecause each female typically lays between 30 and 50 eggs, lanternfly populations can explode in just a few years. These egg masses can be hard to spot, closely resembling mud splotches.\nWithout native natural predators, lanternfly populations can develop under the radar over several years until they emerge in unignorable numbers.\n\"It really wasn't all of the sudden,\" Dr. Michael Raupp, a professor of entomology at the University of Maryland, said.\n\"They were really here for several years, but at low levels,\" Raupp stated. \"Now, because they've had time for their populations to increase, we're seeing them everywhere.\"\nWhat can you do?\nContrary to popular belief, some experts say that killing an individual spotted lanternfly does little to curb the insect's population growth.\n\"The thing that regulates their population are predators, parasites and diseases,\" Raupp said. \"So, by stepping on some spotted lanternflies, it's kind of like spitting in the ocean and thinking you've turned back the tide.\"\nInstead, Maryland's Department of Agriculture recommends installing circle traps, which capture spotted lanternflies without using chemicals that may put other insect populations at risk.\nThese traps wrap around trees to funnel spotted lanternflies into a dead-end container, and can be either purchased or made at home. It may also be helpful to dispose of egg masses if you see them.\nSpotted lanternflies prefer to feast on the Tree of Heaven plant, which is another invasive species from Asia. Removing a Tree of Heaven (roots and all) from your yard can help avoid attracting the insect.\nLastly, checking your vehicles before traveling can also help to prevent the spread.\n\"Make sure that you don't bring spotted lanternfly with you on your daily commute,\" Boyles said.\nUltimately, however, experts forecast that spotted lanternfly populations will eventually subside once they begin to face more predation and disease.\n\"Eventually, Mother Nature will take care of this, as she does with many of our invasive species,\" Raupp said.\nSome areas have already begun to see population declines due to an increase in predators and disease.\n\"We now have more than 1,000 observations of indigenous vertebrates and invertebrates eating spotted lanternflies,\" Raupp said.\nSome of these predators include spiders, mantises, chickens and pheasants.\nThis is not to say, however, that stomping lanternflies is futile.\n\"If you're killing one…you are making sure that that spotted lanternfly can't essentially quadruple its numbers,\" Boyles said.\nAs lanternflies continue to lay eggs up until the first frost, often in December, it can still be worth it to squash the pests, experts say.\nWhy bother reporting?\nCurrently, the state's Department of Agriculture is still accepting reports of spotted lanternfly sightings across Maryland.\nAlthough officials acknowledge that total eradication of the species is unlikely, reporting helps the agency to allocate resources to areas experiencing large populations of lanternflies.\n\"That information is vital,\" Boyles said. \"It does help us.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
