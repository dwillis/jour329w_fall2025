He is 25 years old, and I feel his marriage failed due to his misogynistic comments. Over the past couple of years, he started watching a YouTuber who has been giving him these ideas.If I'm honest, I also feel as if his actions are a result of my poor parenting.I am his mother, and I raised him to become the man he is today. Since moving in, he has been making my two daughters' lives much more difficult, and they will often get into arguments with him because he constantly talks down to them.My daughters tell me that I should kick him out of the house because he shouldn't be here, but I'm scared to do so because his finances are really tight right now due to his divorce and inflation.How do you suggest I navigate this situation? - Wayward Son DEAR WAYWARD SON: You may not be ready to put your son out of your house, but surely you can lay down the law.Establish ground rules for how you expect him to behave while he is there.That includes speaking respectfully to his sisters.Give him examples of how he has been talking to them and how hurtful his words have been. Go a step further and have a serious talk with him about what happened in his marriage, how you believe the YouTuber has negatively influenced him and even how you may have steered him wrong. Tell him he can stay with you for a while if he is willing to treat everyone respectfully. Otherwise, he has to go.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist and founder of DREAMLEAPERS, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

    "content": "Cease minimizing the work you do for Jesus\n\n August 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ray C. Parsons; Park Lane Church Of God | Page: 22 | Section: News \n \n 862\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In my lifetime, I've only walked or ridden in a dozen or so parades. It started when I joined the Cub Scouts in 1966.Each experience carried a certain level of exuberance. It really didn't matter what the weather conditions were. Honestly. Being asked to or \"signing up\" was all about representing someone, a new promotion, a long-time running organization or some genré.What happens for most parade enthusiasts is an internal motivation that drives the procession along.If you're going to be a great coach, you need to lead and become comfortable with internal motivation. Teams rise to the level of their coach's motivation.And whenever a team includes an entire nation that's under heavy attack - the coach (commander) better be an incredible motivator. Agree?That nation existed. War World II was just beginning. The Great Britain team seemed like it was terribly losing, until one of the most inspiring leaders of the 20th century, coach and Prime Minister Winston Churchill stepped up.Almost single-handed at first, Churchill motivated his entire nation to make huge sacrifices to conquer what seemed like an \"unwinnable\" victory.The nation's coach desperately needed the co-op and sacrificial efforts of Britain's coal industry onboard. Their alliance would be critical to keep the war efforts going.His plan was masterful. Churchill asked the industrial and union leaders to picture the victory parade. \"Look at the proud British sailors who kept the sea lanes open Look at the soldiers who valiantly fought the land war Look at the airmen who heroically won the battle in the skies Now, look at the coal miners of Britain who followed them. Because of their hard work - victories were possible They (miners) will not be in military uniform, but they will have won a place in the victory parade.\" Did you know the ultimate world war is still raging?The war between the forces of Christ (light and comfort) and the forces of Satan (darkness and chaos) is on high alert. The battlefield is every human life Jesus Christ died for. That battle has never been more intense than now. As this final battle approaches climax, I ask: What place will you take in the great victory parade of King Jesus?In 1 Samuel 30:24, King David just won a mighty victory. He has left behind 200 \"totally worn out\" soldiers, with simple orders: \"guard the supplies\" - guard the goods; secure the spoils, and keep watch over the wins! Some of the front-liners didn't think King (coach) David's orders and assignment was fair. To some soldiers, the 200 \"worn out and weary\" should not get fair shares in the spoils of the victory.(30:24) \"The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike.\" What a liberating Biblical principle! Remaining in flight, and tuning in to the master plan - equals an updraft! Sovereign God considers those who fight the battle and those who support the frontliners as equal contributors and shareholders in the victory.W hat a parade rush. Imagine arriving in heaven and God showing a long list of names on your account? Like anybody else, you ask the rewarding Lord: \"But where did all these names come from? I don't even know these people. I've never held conversations.Never prayed with them.Never studied the Bible with all these folks. Never shared communion with them.\" And all-knowing Lord replies: \"You are right again. But they were reached by a ministry that you financially supported through an outreach you prayed for. You took your place and helped win every one of them with your heart and hands!Would you like to meet them now?\" You may feel like your part in the work of the Lord is small, minuscule, hidden away and insignificant. You might have said: \"But all I do is volunteer when I can, just drive when I can, just pray when I can, just give money when I can as the Lord leads, just cook when I can, and just work behind the scenes.\" Hear the Word and heart of our Father, \"There is no such thing as 'I just' in 'My Kingdom'.\" Stop discounting your passion.Stop downplaying your assignments, your rank and your file.Hear the heart of Coach-King-Commander David, \"The share of the man who stayed with the supplies (who worked in an unglamorous, inglorious role) is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike.\" You may feel like your work is insignificant. Get out of your feelings. Get into your faith factor.Jesus never sees anything given in His name as insignificant.Actually, Jesus promises His always appreciating rewards for anyone who offers a cup of cold water in His name! Cease minimizing the value of the work you do for Jesus. Every text, call, prayer, card, letter, testimony, hand-up and outreach is vitally important.Your part in the longest world war ever (greatest battle) is keeping people from dying without their soul prepared to meet their Maker! Like the black-faced coal miners of Great Britain, you may never button up a soldier's uniform.But believe me, there's a place of honor awaiting you. The Bible tells me so. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Here are the three methods that use ordinary household items and a little elbow grease, beginning with the easiest and least invasive.TOOTHPASTEProvided the scratches are smooth and relatively tiny, toothpaste offers a cheap way to fix scratches on glass.But not just any toothpaste.You want non-gel whitening toothpaste that contains baking soda, such as Arm & Hammer Advance White.First, clean and dry the area well. Next, apply just a dot of toothpaste to a clean, damp, lint-free cloth. Using small, circular motions, work the toothpaste into the scratches for about a minute.Using a clean area on the wet cloth, wipe away the toothpaste. Inspect to see if the scratch has disappeared.If so, rinse well, and buff the glass clean. If evidence of the scratch is still visible, repeat as necessary.METAL POLISHThe next way to fix scratches on glass is to rub them out with metal polish.Slightly more abrasive than toothpaste, metal polish is a better method if the scratches are slightly deeper.CAUTIONSIf you have scratches in your eyeglasses and your lenses have UV, anti-reflective or other types of coatings, DO NOT use any of these methods. You will turn small annoying scratches into a total disaster.As for all other situations that have resulted in scratches on glass, always test in an inconspicuous place first so you can anticipate your results.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book Debt-Proof Living.© 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Years of advocacy have resulted in many Americans willing to adopt greyhounds, but at the same time, greyhound racing has fallen out of favor here in the United States, where there are only two remaining race tracks in West Virginia.\"There are over 150 Greyhound-specific adoption groups throughout the United States and Canada, but we're all scrambling after dogs that are retiring from two tracks,\" Roberts explained.\"The situation in Australia is exactly the opposite. Greyhound racing is very active there, but they do not have the adoption network.\" A few years ago, an Australian rescue group, Racing 2 Rehome, began working with groups on the U.S. West Coast to find homes for dogs, and that effort is now expanding to the East Coast.The organization has since flown more than 200 dogs to the U.S. and Canada in partnership with 14 different North American rescue groups.A representative from Racing to Rehome met with Roberts and others from GPAD last year, and the Delaware group agreed to take an initial four dogs from Australia. Last month, the dogs were loaded aboard an Air Canada flight and flown from Sydney to Melbourne and then on to Vancouver, Canada. After resting for a night, they were flown to Toronto and then put on a van and driven over the U.S. border to Niagara Falls, N.Y.Roberts and two other volunteers from Delaware drove up to get them and brought them to board member Gail Rys' house in Newark, where other volunteers helped bathe them and get them ready for adoption.Two have already been adopted, including one who was adopted by a former GPAD board member who now lives in Nevada and drove all the way back to Newark to pick up the dog. Two others remain available for adoption, along with a few other dogs from West Virginia.GPAD, which places an average of 50 greyhounds per year, is hoping to receive four more dogs from Australia later this year.\"It gets those dogs out of Australia, where they don't have homes for them, and it brings them here where we can find homes for them. It's very mutually beneficial,\" Roberts said.U.S. rescue groups pay $500 per dog, and the Australian group covers the rest of the cost of flying the dogs here, Roberts said.Greyhounds are retired between 18 months old and five years old, depending on the success of their racing career.For information on adopting a greyhound, visit gpadelaware.org. Applicants must consent to a home visit and, if chosen to receive a dog, pay a $525 adoption fee. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED PHOTO\n \nBob Cruikshank drove from Nevada to Newark to pick up his new adoptive dog from Australia, Ruby Jo.\n \nSUBMITTED PHOTO\n \nFreddy, a greyhound from Australia, gets a bath after arriving in Newark. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Favored by his father, betrayed by his jealous brothers, sold into slavery, falsely accused and gifted by God in a unique way, Joseph's is certainly a complex and complicated life filled with huge challenges and temptations.How could someone in such crazy situations consistently make such good and holy decisions?It is hard to comprehend until you realize the repeated phrase from the Genesis author that unlocks the secret to his life. We read multiple times through the story that \"the Lord was with Joseph.\" How does this young man keep his integrity, his focus, his vision and his purity through all the adversity and challenge?He lived a life that reflected an absolute assurance that God was with him. When given the opportunity to fall to temptation with Potiphar's wife, the Lord was with him.When given the chance to be lost in despair in prison, the Lord was with him.When given the chance to get revenge on his brothers, the Lord was with him.And that knowledge helped him make wise and holy choices that blessed himself and others!How might your life look different if you lived daily in the assured and absolute knowledge that the Lord was with you?How might your choices and decisions change?After all, our Lord's departing words were \"Behold, I am with you always\" (Matthew 28:20). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He is turning 50 soon and doesn't want to have to raise babies now that he's older. He says that for most people at 50, their children are moving out, not just being born.I really love him and don't want to have to separate, but having children is something I have always dreamed of and seen myself doing. Do you believe that there is a way I will be able to convince him to have children of our own, or should I give in to his demands and just continue nannying? - Time To Give Up DEAR TIME TO GIVE UP: Given that you have gotten engaged to this man, you must believe that he is your soulmate. Sit with this for a moment. Is this man the one for you?Life is filled with compromises, even for the luckiest of us. Can you live with this one? It is unlikely that you can convince your fiance to change his mind about children.Since you love children so much, nannying does sound like a way to be integral to children's lives without bringing them home with you. Perhaps it is an ideal situation, given your circumstances. You have to dig deep on this one to see if you can happily live with the decision not to have children without resenting your husband. Otherwise, the relationship won't work.Harriette Cole is a life stylist and founder of DREAMLEAPERS, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

Our summer has been unusually hot but is slowly coming to an end. With the return of children to school that seems to change the pace and focus for the families and community. We seem to breathe a sigh of relief and say \"Thank you Lord\" for your mercies. We made it.Along with the widespread heat we have been and are yet faced with things and conditions of our land and nation. Things that have escalated to a degree that we've not seen or experienced before. Beware, none the less we've been told in the word of God that these things must be before the return of the Lord. We are all occupying until He, Jesus returns. We're all living on borrowed time. Each new day is a gift, appreciate it.As individuals and families we yet have plans, hopes and dreams, myself included. We want to be debt free, see our children and grandchildren grow up healthy and be successful, retire to sit on the porch and have healthy conversation and not screen time. I'm reminded of what I used to hear the older, wiser generation say, \"Lord willing and the creek don't rise,\" meaning Lord, if you spare me/us another day this is my desire.I'm sure that everyone in Maui had plans, hopes and dreams, but in a matter of hours it was all reduced to ashes. I say for myself and others in this region, Lord, thank you for your mercies. The earth is groaning and climate change is speaking loud and clear; glaciers are melting filling oceans at concerning levels and giving up the bodies of the dead who've been there for years. Our ocean temperatures have exceeded 100 degrees.We will always have the homeless and poor with us, but now with the change and shift in the economy we have a new cluster of the upper, upper class that are affected. The cost of a pickup truck is the price of a single family tiny home. Which do you live in, in the USA?So many are one paycheck from homelessness, and we are all one breath away from death.Are you ready to meet Jesus? God is telling us something. In His mercy He has delayed His coming, but the signs are saying, \"I'm coming quickly.\" When we recall these events to mind we can all say, it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. We fail ourselves and the Lord, but His compassions fail not, they are new every morning.Great is the Lord's faithfulness. We must truly repent and seek the Lord. Truly accept Him and allow Him to be our portion and strength. He has the plan, the blueprint/nail prints. Look up and wait for His salvation, His return, for it draws nigh. Come to Jesus before His mercies run out. I pray we'll all be ready for His return.Scripture Reference: Lamentations 3:19-25 \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He wished to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery.A year later, his ashes are still sitting in a box in his widow's closet, her trying to jump through all the hoops and red tape to get the burial scheduled since his death.A fellow Navy veteran, and former friend and neighbor of my father-in-law, passed away after he did, and was interned in Arlington three weeks later. He may have ranked a little higher in the Navy, but what about the unknown soldier?I know this is only important to a few people, his widow, and the immediate family, but sadly another example of why it is difficult to be a proud American anymore.Even in death, this decorated Navy veteran is getting the runaround from our beloved country that he fought to protect.He is in a queue, and the service is scheduled to happen in February or March. Hopefully his widow and his friends will still be alive to pay their respects.JAN HALLBAUEREast New Market \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We read in Chapter 3, verse 21-23, \"But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, His mercies never come to an end.They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness!\" We often find ourselves lamenting the state of the world today.Injustices against minorities, human trafficking, mass shootings and other heartbreaking occurrences seem to dominate the headlines of the news. Even so, amid all our trials, troubles and tribulations, we are reminded that the sun peeks out from the clouds, and a single candlelight can chase the night away.In John 8:12, Jesus tells us that He is \"the light of the world\", and those who follow Him \"will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.\" With God's word, and with Jesus as the light of the world that we follow, we have the hope that the \"steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never come to an end.\" In the end, it will be all right. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

You have discovered they are liars. But I have this complaint against you.You don't love me or each other as you did at first!\" (Revelation 2:2-4; NLT) The Ephesian Church was trying so hard to get things just right in their church. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, they were commended for doing such. But they became so caught up with the world of rules and doing things correctly that it caused them to lose their passion for God and for other people.They believed all the right things, but it caused them to become spiritual traffic cops.They had become judgmental and quick to point fingers.They were so busy correcting people and making sure that no sinful practices entered their church that they forgot that they were also supposed to be loving people.Too often, church becomes a place where people go to prove to everyone that they are obeying all the rules and doing all the right things. Anyone who does not pass our morality checkpoints, too often are not welcomed there.And the place begins to get cold and lifeless.We begin to lose our passion for seeing lost people come into a relationship with Jesus Christ. Lost people begin to become a nuisance to us.We even begin to question the spirituality of each another.Our churches must adhere to sound theology and doctrine. But we must also never forget that which should motivate us to be holy: we are to love God and love others. This is our first love. Let's not lose that. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

However, the truth is, the devil has seemed to be pretty successful at pickpocketing us.The evidence to that, when we need it, we don't seem to have, and it seems like we are always praying for it, but the good news is that we can turn the tide and see things change for God's glory.It is through God's wonderful gift of prayer, that we can find God's truth to be our belt, His righteousness to be our breastplate, and His gospel of peace to be our shoes, our faith to be our shield, our salvation to be our helmet, and God's Word to be our sword.It is through prayer in Christ's name that we can storm the gates of hell, snatch others from the flame, tear down strongholds, and see our brothers and sisters in Christ strengthened in their journeys.We can see souls saved, bodies healed, minds restored and lives transformed.The barren womb can bring forth a child, and the end of a thing can be better than the beginning there of. Faith can replace fear, and sorrow can be conquered by joy. All we have to do, is go boldly to the Lord in prayer.- Eph.6/Jude 1:23/Matt.16:18/2 Cor. 10:3-5/2 Tim. 2:1/Acts 2:41/Jer.17:14/Heb.11:11. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Fall is coming this week, let's get cooking\n\n September 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 887\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n My favorite season is just a few days away, but I have already decorated inside and partially outside.So now let's start some fall cooking.There are many fall vegetables available from late September through early November. Some of those vegetables include acorn squash, brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, jalapeno peppers, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, turnips and green peppers to name a few. Fall is a busy time on the farm - preparing to harvest the crops and to harvest the late garden vegetables.School has started but the garden work was still a part of our daily chores. With schoolwork and homework most was done on the weekends. My brothers and I loved fall sports and were anxious to get the \"outside stuff\" over with - waiting for the first frost.Happy fall, y'all.Let's begin our fall cooking with ROASTED BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUPThis soup is the best I have ever tasted, This recipe is super creamy but yet uses no cream and is full of butternut flavor. Leftovers are just as tasty as the day you made it. This recipe yields about 6 cups or 4 soup bowls full.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.Cut one large butternut squash in half vertically and remove the seeds.Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and place squash on the paper with cut side facing up. Sprinkle about ½ teaspoon olive oil on the inside of each squash half rubbing the oil to coat the inside. Sprinkle each half lightly with salt and pepper.Turn the two squash halves now face down and cook until completely tender and cooked through - about 40 to 50 minutes.Meanwhile in a large soup pot place 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat and heat until shimmering. In a blender on the soup mode place 1 large shallot, 1 teaspoon salt, and blend well then pour into the soup pot and cook until the shallots are tender and starting to turn golden, about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.Add 4 minced garlic cloves and continue stirring and cooking for another minute.Using a large spoon, scoop the buttermilk squash flesh into the blender, discarding the skin, and add one teaspoon maple syrup, ½ teaspoon nutmeg and a dash of black pepper. Blend for several minutes, remove from the blender, and stir into a soup pot over medium heat. Add remaining ingredients - 3 to 4 cups vegetable broth, and 1 to 2 tablespoons butter. Rapidly boil until soup is heated through, stirring to ensure the smooth creamy consistency (add more broth if too thick). Serve.Another great fall vegetable. available right now. is broccoli. A family favorite at my house is BROCCOLI CHEESE CASSEROLE which is a year-round recipe for many occasions. Rinse and steam one large bunch of broccoli until slightly tender. Grease a 11 x 7 casserole dish and arrange broccoli in the dish. Sprinkle 2 cups chopped sharp cheddar cheese on top and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. in a bowl combine 2 lightly beaten eggs with 1 can cream of mushroom soup, ½ cup mayo and ½ cup chopped onions - mix well and spread over cheese. Combine 4 tablespoons softened butter with 1½ cups herbed seasoned stuffing mix and place on top of broccoli mixture in a casserole. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.HARVEST BOWL1. c. wild rice blend, 2. c. chicken broth, 2 tbsp. unsalted butter, 1. tsp. kosher salt divided, 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and cut in half, 2 small, sweet potatoes, cut into. inch cubes, 2 tbsp. olive oil, 1 tsp. ground black pepper, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. cayenne, 1 rotisserie chicken about 2 pounds, 2 c. fresh baby kale, 1 Honeycrisp apple cored and cubed,. c. crumbled goat cheese,. c. roasted, salted almonds, coarsely chopped.FOR THE BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE3 tbsp. balsamic vinegar, 2 tsp. honey, 2 tsp.

Barron, otherwise known as Bishop Barron. He is the founder of Word on Fire Ministries and Bishop of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester (MN).In a recent message he spoke on \"death\" and our need to think about it more.However, we tend to look at life daily as if it would never end. If we meditated on the finality of our life, we might value it better and look to find the Lord in each moment.I was reminded of this today when two men in our over 50 community were found dead. One died in his sleep and the other hadn't been seen outside of his home for some time.When they broke down his door, they found he had been dead for a few days. He died alone. Just the opposite but the result was the same when a friend of mine, Jerry died four days ago or so. We served in the same churches many years ago, but only in recent years reconnected through Facebook. He had seen my prayer requests asking to pray for me as I dealt with cancer. He assured me he would be faithful to join my \"prayer warriors\" in my fight for life.It seems it wasn't long after that he messaged me to tell me he needed the same.Cancer has a way of turning your thoughts to the reality of your mortality. This is especially true if for 12 years, each year your doctors are telling you, \"You only have a year or maybe two to live.\"It is not a bad thing as Bishop Barron would encourage to think about your life considering its tentative existence. Values change, behaviors are examined, relationships are prioritized and time maximized.Cancer should not be the only motivator; death comes in many ways and by many means.When we first moved into our community my immediate neighbor told me that this was the place where retired people move in to live and then they die. Now he is gone too. No matter where you live thinking about death helps you to prioritize life and make you ready for the one to come.FATHER ROB CARL EastonTeaching GunnarMy son was born in 1980. I used to take him to the Columbia Mall.Routinely, before we left, we visited the pet store and selected a little furry dog to play with in the pen. Then we would head over to the Hobby Store.One day, I was dusting my son's room. I stumbled across a little diary and sat down to read it. Suddenly, my skin began to slightly boil. In the diary he wrote: \"Dear Diary, I feel so bad. Mom took me to the Hobby Store. I saw clay and I took it.\"My mother would have used the wooden spoon on me and condemned me to the basement for a few months to teach me a lesson not to steal. I thought of a more creative way.I phoned the Hobby Store and spoke to the manager. I informed him that my son took some clay. I then asked him if he would be so kind as to place a message on my answering machine stating that he witnessed my son take the clay. The man hesitated and said that it was not necessary.I begged to differ.I would typically pick my son up from school, return home and push my answering machine button.This particular day was the same. We walked inside, and he witnessed me push the button. Then we both heard it loud and clear: \"Gunnar Lindberg, this is the manager of the Hobby Store. I saw you take a piece of clay, and you better bring it back!\" I thought my son was going to pee on the floor.I looked at him and asked, \"Did you steal clay from that store? Where is it?\" (He cried, he stumbled.)\"We are going back to the Columbia Mall right now with the clay.\"The drive to the mall was not a pleasant one for my son. Once there, I saw the manager and said, \"My son has something for you.\" The manager held out his hand and said, \"You should not take anything that is not yours.\" Then I asked, \"Do you have a broom?\" The manager replied, \"Yes.\"Then I said, \"My son is going to sweep your floors for you. I will pick him up in three hours right before you close.\"Today, brooms still make my son a bit nervous and . little pieces of clay.CATHY LINDBERG JAROSZ EastonPlay the song rightRemember that cartoon that upset many recently, when Jesus was depicted as a Democrat? MD and Billy K's rebuttals to J Gondeck's \"heads in the sand \" letter (by the way, the same edition with J Gondeck's letter showed a photo and editorial about the Proud Boys deserving what they get and then the next full page featuring Hillary back in the Whitehouse the irony!) reminds me of this.It makes me think, what would Jesus do? How do we make the reTrumplicans and Democrats get along? Like being in a band or playing on a team (go O's!), as fellow Americans, we have to get along.Know the play, get the facts, play by the rules, follow the law, be humble. To win, to play the song right.Well love thy neighbor, the next day's Star Democrat-edition's focus on Dorchester County quoted Theresa Stafford saying poverty is a \"lead driver\" for many issues in Cambridge (arguing about a curfew) and I'll say everywhere else too, poverty is the problem.Some compassion from the rich maybe although they would call it handouts.Maybe more philanthropy from athletes (go O's!) I don't know. What would Jesus do?He would gather those 25 kids and feed them and shelter them and love them.JAN HALLBAUER East New MarketWilling to reap rewardsPaul Peters' Sept. 15 follow-up to John Gondeck's provacative piece of the day before on Hunter Biden's and his father's peccadilloes assumes but doesn't specifically state that Joe made possible his son's ability to self-entangle that resulted in lucrative gains for the lad and who knows what else.How were those possible?Surely no Star reader, nor anyone elsewhere in this land, thinks there's a chance that a foreign nation wouldn't latch onto the fact that catering to Hunter will be all that's necessary to kissit-up with Joe, whatever Dad's political capacity be then or will be in future. And it didn't take long for these actions to have the desired effect, did it?For Joe to tell us that he's not connected with his son's affairs, doesn't talk to him about them (not even at home or sitting side-by-side on long international flights on official U.S government aircraft) proves that Joe's a colossal liar; further that he's desperate enough to expose himself to the characterization.The duo is so willing to reap the rewards from breaking the law that they ignore the effect of the \"appearance of evil\" that honest people try to avoid.OLIVER BERLINER Easton \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

His friend was venting about being unhappy with the base salary at his new job. My husband then revealed that he should be happy with that salary, and how it is more than I am making now.Though I don't believe that my husband had malicious intent, I was angry that he disclosed my salary without my permission. I told him then and there that he had no right to offer that information to his friend, and his defense was that he would not care if I did the same to him. Am I overreacting?I'm still fairly upset that I didn't get an apology.- Private Info DEAR PRIVATE INFO: Don't wait for an apology. You could be waiting for a long time. What you can do is establish clear lines of demarcation for what you consider to be private about your life.Think about what else you don't want your husband to share. Because couples typically talk about everything in detail - including a lot of intimacies that you would never want shared with others - it makes sense that you might need to draw the line about certain things. Finances are likely at the top of the list, as are health issues, family challenges what else?Make a list and recommend that he do the same. This is something you may want to consider doing from time to time to ensure that you are on the same page.Also, if you know that your spouse finds it difficult to keep certain information to himself, you may choose to withhold sensitive details as an extra layer of protection.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist and founder of Dream-Leapers, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

I don't know about you, but I need a do-over, and I'm so glad that God specializes in do-overs.God is not moved by the imperfections of this world. He is not moved by the trials and tribulations of this world. He is moved by our faith because God is a God that never changes.He truly is the same yesterday, today, and forever more, which means if God did it before, God will do it again.If God healed you before, God will heal you again. If God delivered you before, God will deliver again. If God restored before, God will restore again.If God shut the mouth of the lion in the den, if He shut the mouth of the devil before, He will most certainly do it again on our behalf.If God showed favor on your life before, you better believe that God will do that thing again. If God covered you and protected you before, God will do it again. God specializes in do-overs.So, family, be encouraged as you read and ponder these thoughts today. If you are at wits end. If you are waning in faith, spiritual strength and hope I want you to remember what God has already done. If God has moved in your life before, trust and believe He will do it again.Maybe you don't believe it but be challenged today while you ponder. If you trust God. If you will lay your burdens down, the God who changes not, will do it again in your life.Paul said, \"Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable - if anything is excellent or praiseworthy - think about such things.\" (Philippians 4:8 NIV).So again, be encouraged.Say the words God will do it again because the God we serve can and will make a way out of now way. God is not a man that He shall lie, nor is the Son of Man that he should repent.Watch and wait. For they who wait on the Lord shall be renewed. Ponder and be blessed. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Rather than thinking there is no solution for that stain, shrunken item or another laundry disaster, consider the ways you can recover and renew situations gone bad.SHRUNKENDon't be too quick to toss out that favorite sweater that just got shrunk in the hot wash or went through the dryer accidentally set to hot. Chances are good you can unshrink it if you move quickly: In a large container, make a solution with 1 gallon lukewarm water and 2 tablespoons baby shampoo. Soak the shrunken garment in the solution for about 10 minutes until totally saturated.Now, the important part: Don't rinse. Simply blot out all the excess water with a dry towel and gently lay it flat on a fresh towel. Reshape slowly and carefully as you stretch it back to its original size. Dry away from direct sunlight or heat.This technique will work provided the fibers have not become permanently damaged, or \"felted.\"SUPER STAINSYou've washed and dried that item dozens of times and still the ugly grease or other annoying stain hangs on. Before you toss it out, try one more thing, Lestoil.It's been around like forever, but so few people know about it. Lestoil, an all-purpose, heavy-duty oil and grease remover, has been manufactured right here in the USA for decades.Lestoil can be used fullstrength on stains, especially really difficult stains - the kind of stains you just give up on like ink, toner, grease, oil, scuff marks, blood, lipstick, nail polish, paint, grass stains, coffee stains, crayon and marker stains on every surface you can imagine. Even the sticky stuff left behind by stickers and labels.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\"COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This colleague has known my daughter since she was a young child, so I feel extremely uncomfortable about this situation - and a little angry. My daughter is in her late 20s now, so the decision is ultimately up to her, but even if they were to hit it off, I know I'd never be OK with it. - Stay AwayDEAR STAY AWAY: Step back a moment and think about your colleague.What redeeming qualities does this man have as a person? What do you know about his relationship history? Has he ever done anything untoward regarding your daughter?Assess as much as you can about him and his character. It is understandably unnerving for this to be happening, but you are not in control of this.DEAR HARRIETTE: I have been a board member of my church for a long time, and it's a big part of my life. I am in a relatively new relationship with someone who is not interested in discussing church or religion and refuses to attend church-related events. This makes it hard for me to balance my personal life and my involvement in the church. It's important to me that they at least try to come to an event with me every once in a while. - Trying To CompromiseDEAR TRYING TO COMPROMISE: I understand why you want to make space for this person, but it doesn't sound like they are reciprocating. If your church life is that important to you, how are you going to make this work?

Regulating the exact temperatures of both the oven and the meat are the secret.No. 2: Tie it, salt it. Tie the roast with white cotton string so it's compact and evenly shaped, and salt it well. Not a light sprinkling - at least 1 tablespoon.Don't be stingy. Rub it in well.No. 3: Wrap it up. Use plastic wrap to wrap it up tightly. Refrigerate for 24 hours.No. 4: Free it up. Remove the plastic wrap and place the roast in a roasting pan, uncovered.No. 5: Insert meat thermometer.Insert the thermometer so that the tip is about halfway through (in the middle).No. 6: Preheat oven to 250 F. Place the oven thermometer in the middle of the oven. You are going to rely on it, not the one that is built into the oven. This is critical.Once the temperature reaches 250 F on the oven thermometer, adjust the oven temperature dial to coincide so it doesn't heat up any hotter than 250 F.No. 7: Set roast in the oven. Leave the roast in the oven until its internal temperature is exactly 130 F.You will know because you left that meat thermometer inserted. Once it hits 130 F, remove the roast from the oven. Remove the meat thermometer.No. 8: Quickly wrap in foil. Once the roast is completely wrapped in foil, allow the meat to rest for exactly 20 minutes.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

God created the human race and as time continued man's wickedness became great on the earth.There was a rapid spiritual decline after the first sin. Man's every imagination and his thoughts were evil, and the earth was filled with violence. They had no time for God until it was too late. It repented the Lord that he had made man and He said that He would destroy all of mankind from the face of the earth, but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord, and it was that grace that saved Noah and his family.God gave Noah the plans for building the ark, and when it was completed and loaded the Bible says that God shut the door. No one else could enter and everyone outside was lost. There was an end to God's patience.In Matthew 24:37-39 Jesus speaking says, \"But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the day before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the Ark, and knew not until the flood came and took them all away, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.\"Look around, at all the immorality, hate, evil and violence of our day, how can we not believe that the words ofJesus are true for us today, and that He will return. God's grace, mercy and love saved Noah and his family, and that is the only hope for us who are living today. If we die, or ifJesus returns, as He promised, God will shut the door again.We must confess our sins today and stop our sinful living and look to Jesus Christ, for He is our only Hope. There is coming a time in this world when there will be an end to God's patience again, with humanity, and that is why we need to know Jesus Christ as our personal savior today. This is why we need to know the truth today about why God set the flood. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The exact dilution ratio will depend on the severity of the smoke film and soot, but a common starting point is 1 part Lestoil to 4 parts water.Adjust as needed.Before using Lestoil on the entire affected area, it's a good practice to test the solution in a small, inconspicuous spot to ensure it doesn't damage or discolor the surface. Wait a few minutes to observe any adverse reactions.Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for Lestoil, and again, please exercise caution when using it on delicate or painted surfaces.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"DebtProof Living.\"COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If you think someone is following you, make four right turns, which will in essence have you driving in a circle.If that suspicious car makes the same turns, immediately drive to the nearest police station, busy store, or service station to seek help. - TomDECALS, STICKERSRemove a decal or any type of sticker by first softening the adhesive with a hair dryer. Use a medium heat setting for a few seconds until the adhesive softens and the sticker starts to peel. Continue with the heat until the entire sticker peels off easily. - BarbCLUTCH FIRSTOn standard or manual-shift cars, get into the habit of always pushing in the clutch before starting the engine, regardless of whether the car is in gear. Besides being an obvious safety practice, holding the clutch in while starting the engine lets it turn over just a bit more easily, lessening the power required from the battery and starter motor. - BradIVORYTo clean anything ivory, like piano keys or carved objects, wipe with a solution of 1 tablespoon hydrogen peroxide and 1 cup water. No need to rinse. - SherylONE BITE AT A TIMESet aside 15 minutes each day to clean one area of your house. By the weekend, you won't have much more cleaning to do. - Sylvia Got a tip you'd like to shareft You can send it to tips@everydaycheapskate.com. Who knows?

Your mother may be uncomfortable about the idea at first, but it is OK to let her know your intentions.Thank your mother for all that she has done to care for you for your whole life. Point out how hard it may have been at times, especially since your father passed away so early in your life.Tell her that you are curious about him and his family, and you want her help in learning about them and finding them.Listen to her thoughts on the subject. Find out if she knows how to reach any of his people. Probe to learn their names and any other clues about them.Do your research to put the pieces together. Also, ask her why she didn't maintain a relationship with them. There may be good reasons why she has kept her distance.

No worries when you know how to make Peanut Sauce Noodles - only three ingredients.What a fantastic, quick, anytime meal - kid-friendly, too. Even a fifth grader could get this meal on the table (with supervision).Make sure you have these three ingredients: peanut butter, soy sauce, noodles.Get a pan of water boiling on the stovetop, add the noodles, and cook for about seven minutes, or the amount of time in the package instructions.In the meantime, get out another small pan. Place 1/4 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup soy sauce in the pan over medium heat and stir well until incorporated.Add 1/4 cup of the water you've cooked the pasta in.

The continuation of wars and the rumors of wars, the rising cost of food and commodities used to create the products we hold essential to our way of living, the political gridlock that stems from our elected officials choosing to place party over principles, and the violence that has become too prevalent in our towns and cities.All of these things and more can conspire to disturb our peace of mind and break the tranquility of our lives.But there is something I have found that is able to keep us from falling into the pit of despair even amid the challenges of a world seemingly gone mad - something so powerful that it causes the light of hope to perpetually shine through the increasing darkness of fallen humanity.That something is faith.It is faith in the will of Almighty God to take care of His own. It is this faith that causes me to trust the sacred promise that \"many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord brings them out of them all.\"With faith, my friends, we who believe are able to see beyond the tests and trials of the day no matter how harsh or severe they may become to a reality that supersedes this world of shadows.That faithful reality is what inspired the Apostle Paul to proclaim in Romans 8:18 \"for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us.\" To paraphrase a quote from Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., with the power of faith, we are able to chisel the \"mountains of despair into precious stones of hope.\" In these troubling days, it seems like we all take losses of some sort, but the one thing we cannot afford to lose is our faith in the Almighty to care for us.And no matter what uncertainties tomorrow may bring our way, let us continue to move forward trusting in the Lord. \"For we walk by faith, not by sight\" (2 Cor. 5:7). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Scripture tells us in Malachi 3:6, \"For I am the LORD, I do not change\" Without God as our source of stability because He does not change, we will find many difficulties in handling the changes that come in our lives. He is the steadfast rock that gives us a sure foundation to be able to walk through all of the changes in this life.As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday, take time to reflect on the various seasons of your life, and I believe you will see a constant source of strength that has enabled stability through the seasons and changes of life.Take time to give thanks for His grace and mercy and all of the blessings He gives through each season.I hope each of you have a blessed Thanksgiving holiday and an amazing Christmas season! \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some people have a fear of numbers like 13 and 666. What in the wor l ddoes anumberhavetodowith anything?Not being superstitious, there are times I am slightly confused about life. Something happens that I don't feel I'm in charge of.For example, the other morning, the gracious mistresslof the parsonage entered the living room, where I was sitting on myl easy chair drinking coffee. With alhuge smile, she said, \"I got you an apple fritter for this morning.\" And she gave it to me, smiled at me and then walked away.The following day, I got up and got my coffee, went out to my easy chair in the living room, and started to sip it very carefully.As I was getting situated, the gracious mistress of the parsonage walked in, and I saw in her hand another apple fritter.Again, I got up the following day, went and got my coffee, and sat in my easy chair. In a few mo me nts, in walks lthe grfccio Bs mistress of the parsonage, and in her hand is another apple fritter.\"Here's an apple fritter for you this morning. I think you'll enjoy it today.\" She smiled at me, turned around, and returned to the kitc hen.It's not that I can't handle an apple fritter because I can. It's the fact that someone is bringing these apple fritters to me who does not like apple fritters. Something is happening behind the scenes, and I'm anxious to find o ut.The next day, the same thing happened. Now I'm getting to be suspicious. What in the world am I missing here?Not wanting to sabotage my good luck the last four days, I kept silent and enjoyed the fritter. Whatever is behind this, I may never know, but I w ill enjoy it for whatever it is worth.I couldn't help thinking of a Bible verse, \"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not\" (Galatians 6:9).Sometimes, the best thing to do is NOTHING and let God have it.Dr. James L.

    "content": "Giving thanks by giving back, all year long - Salvation Army prepares for upcoming holiday season\n\n November 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Debra Messick; Special To The Star Democrat | Page: 8 | Section: News \n \n 1179\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - \"It takes this whole community for us to be able to do what we do, and they've been so generous, but the need is growing as the economy changes; the need is greater than I think I've ever seen it in all my years serving in the Salvation Army,\" Captain Wendy Parsons said.The familiar sights of red kettles and ringing bells have returned, again ushering in the season of giving. But for the Salvation Army and it's legion of community \"angels,\" there's no beginning or end to the mission of lending a hand.As Parsons said, \"we're always, always busy here.\" There's the perpetual call to provide safe haven and meals for homeless residents at the Robert and Grace Bair Overnight Shelter, located behind the church and offices building at 200 Washington Street in Cambridge.It's a call often answered by individuals, businesses and organizations who selflessly step up, filling in the open dates on the shelter's meal calendar.\"We have several donors who make regular, standing commitments, on, say, the second Tuesday of the month, or the 18th of every month, or whatever fits their calendar, to make sure that those folks have a meal,\" Parsons explained.But in addition to the individual efforts, she's also grateful for the generous ongoing steady donations from local businesses Wawa, Starbucks and Chick-fil-A.\"Anything left over from that, when the food is available, we can offer as graband-go bags. And that's not just for the homeless. That's also for those who are at risk.There are people from around here who work, but money just doesn't go as far as it used to, so 'either I pack a lunch for my kid or pack a lunch for me.' They send their young one off to school with a lunch, but then go off with nothing.Those folks can come by here and have lunch,\" Parsons said.Next door, at the William and Carolyn Tyler Day Services Center, essential services, including showers, clean laundry and the graband-go food bags, offer a respite to many mightily trying, but struggling, to get by day to day.\"There are some people that aren't experiencing homelessness but don't have enough money to do laundry, to pay a dollar a load at the laundromat plus detergent.That's the other thing that people have been very generous about, donating detergent so we can continue to wash clothes for people; it also helps us keep our shelter bedding clean and allows our shelter residents to wash their clothes,\" Parsons said.\"Partners in Giving just made a very generous donation to support Matt Ministries, our street feeding campaign, enabling us to provide 400 meals, mostly to kids every Thursday. We take our food truck, our Emergency Disaster Canteen, which we use to support our first responders, out on large calls with snacks, coffee and water,\" she said.The Salvation Army also maintains and stocks a food pantry, though it's not currently affiliated with the Maryland Food Bank.On the group's Facebook page, shout outs and thank you's are regularly posted, honoring each group donating food, bottled water, cash and other vital needs.Recent \"angels\" publicly recognized include AARP Chapter 1278, which brought in bags of food; Bishop Weldon Johnson and New Life Christian Ministries and Church, who inspired his congregation, which includes Cambridge Police Department Captain Antoine Patton, to collect 1,000 cans of food; Palm Beach Willies, which shared boxes of russet potatoes; and the Cambridge Police Department's Chief Justin Todd and Captain Patton, who personally delivered truckloads of food.The Mushroom Company's employees voted to award over $1,000 raised from their first Family Fun Day raffle to the Salvation Army.Socks are the most requested item at homeless shelters. One hundred pairs of Bombay socks also arrived at the Tyler Day Services Center, delivered by Dwayne White, chairman of the Social Action Committee from Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Second District.\"We have food that comes in through a variety of ways, but we also have people that go out and raise funds or have canned food drives. We're currently well stocked with vegetables, but right now we especially need frozen or canned proteins. Just one of those one pound rolls of hamburger, that's spaghetti for a whole family. Canned tuna and chicken also work,\" Parsons said.The pantry is also currently running very low on nonperishable breakfast items, like cereal, oatmeal or grits.Shelf-stable milk is another ongoing need. Either the donated items or the cash to purchase them are welcome.\"We don't have a boundary here on food,\" Parsons said.\"If you're hungry, you need to come in. I've had somebody come in to get food for their own family and the older lady that lives in the apartment or townhouse next door doesn't have anything, so they share some of the food that we'd given them, it's essentially now feeding two households.\"We don't want kids to go to school hungry, and that's why we partner with Mid-Shore Meals Til Monday, providing them free space in our Thrift store warehouse.We make sure kids can get a meal on Thursday, and they're making sure they have food over the weekend,\" she said.Beyond supplying the basic critical crisis needs of food and shelter, Residential Programs Manager Shane Walker makes sure that people have access to information and other helpful resources to get mentally and physically healthy, like Avenues Recovery or Fassett Magee Medical Center.\"He has contacts, not just here, but in communities across the Shore,\" Parsons said. \"So does our social worker, Mary Justice, who travels to the other counties once a week, working with other agencies to find solutions for people with specific problems including eviction prevention and utility assistance.\"We're not in competition to see who can do better; we come together to bring that person out of crisis into stability.\" The Red Kettle campaign, which supports the mission all year long, started Nov. 9 and continues through Dec.23, with both paid and volunteer bell ringers positions still needing to be filled. Individuals, or groups interested in \"adopting\" a kettle for a day while working in shifts, can find locations closest to them and sign up at registering.com.The other major holiday season initiative, the Angel Tree program, received 400 applicants this year. So far, though, 100 of those are still awaiting adoption. To help ensure these youngsters have a bright Christmas, people can check the QR code or direct link posted on the Salvation Army Cambridge MD Facebook page, or stop by 200 Washington Street and request an angel.The Salvation Army is also urgently seeking donated warehouse space to facilitate the Angel Tree distribution from Dec. 1 through approximately 16, in a location in or close to Cambridge.For more information, call 410-228-2442, or visit southernusa. salvationarmy.org. \n \n Caption: WENDY PARSONS\n \nThrough a donation from Partners in Giving to Matt Ministries, the Salvation Army's street feeding campaign, 400 meals, are provided mostly to kids every Thursday. \"The kids now know, when they see the red and white truck coming, that the hot dog lady is here. That's 1600 meals a month supported, thanks to Partners in Giving's generosity,\" says Caption Wendy Parsons.\n \nDEBRA MESSICK \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Lately, I've been embarrassed by her increasingly rude behavior toward service workers. We recently went to a restaurant, and she was unbelievably disrespectful. She ordered her food, and when it came, she kept asking where her smoothie was. They said it should be on the way, but it wasn't because she never actually ordered it. She kept badgering the staff about it and eventually got the free smoothie she was angling for. Also, she went up to the line cook who made her burger and said that there wasn't enough sauce on it. I didn't hear the full exchange, but by the way he recoiled from her when he handed back her food, I could tell it wasn't a good one. I've tried addressing it subtly, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.How do I approach this situation without damaging the friendship, yet communicate how her behavior is affecting me? - Rude Friend DEAR RUDE FRIEND: Who says you have to be subtle? Your friend has proven that subtlety doesn't work for her. She needs you to be direct and illustrative.Tell her you need to talk to her about something that is bothering you. When you are together, describe how she has behaved with you out in public recently and how you feel about it.Make her understand what you observed about how her behavior impacted the service workers around her and how inappropriate you believe her actions and words were. Let her know she has been behaving in a rude and dismissive manner, and you need her to stop. If she is mad at you for a while, so be it.Friends have to stand up for what's right - even if the cost is temporary disconnection.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist and founder of DREAMLEAPERS, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

    "content": "How to make the ultimate dish cleaner\n\n November 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 14 | Section: News \n \n 306\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It was February 2020 when Procter and Gamble introduced a new product to the homecare market, Dawn Platinum Powerwash Spray.\"It's magical, better than anything we've ever come up with! Dishes almost clean themselves!\" they said.I scoffed. And then millions of social media comments, reviews and videos have proven me wrong.I'm noticing a trending topic in my email inbox. Dawn Powerwash is amazing, and I love it, but it's too expensive! I go through the stuff like it's water! I really need a copycat recipe so I can make it myself. Come on, Mary, you can do it! And with that, I went right to work.After a good deal of testing, sniffing, researching, questioning and snooping, here it is - a copycat recipe for Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray together with several variations that could easily make your version even better.You'll need Blue Dawn Platinum Dishwashing Liquid, 70% isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol, distilled water, any 16 oz. or larger spray bottle and a measuring spoon.Pour 1 3/4 cups distilled water into the clean, empty spray bottle. Add 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) Dawn Platinum Dishwashing Liquid.Add 1 1/2 tablespoons 70% isopropyl alcohol.Apply spray top. Shake gently to combine ingredients.Allow to sit for a few hours to allow everything to meld.One last thing: You may get dizzy once you start looking at Dawn products and options. There's Ultra, Platinum, 3X, 4X, 5X, Advanced, Professional, and that's only a start because there are many colors now, and plenty of scents to go with them. Don't worry.This is not an exact science.There's not much you could do to go wrong.However, I need to point out a somewhat similar P & G Dawn product that does not fit into this copycat recipe. Dawn Ultra Platinum Foam is something completely different.It looks like a short version of Powerwash, but it is not.We'll figure it out another time. \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Karen Murphy Jensen Award for Pro Bono Service and Mentorship was presented to Donna McElroy of the Law Office of Donna B. McElroy in Berlin, Maryland.The award was created to honor a member of the legal community who demonstrates a commitment to pro bono service in addition to mentoring those who are new to the profession or seeking to increase their skills in service to the community.\"Because of these attorneys standing in their corners, the people we serve can stand a little taller, breathe easier, and get better outcomes in their case,\" Girard said.\"Legal representation shouldn't be reserved only for those who can afford it,\" she said. \"The feedback we receive from our partners and the people we serve says it all. A local circuit court judge wrote, 'We on the bench are so grateful for your volunteers.' One client said, 'Because of my financial situation, I never felt that anyone would give my case attention, but my attorney through Shore Legal Access gave 100%.'\" Shore Legal Access relies on its network of volunteers to represent people with limited means in their court cases, with preparing documents, and by providing legal counseling and advice.In 2022, Shore Legal Access volunteers provided 8,350 hours of free legal help, resulting in access to legal representation valued at more than $2 million in financial benefits for Eastern Shore residents.\"The people of the Eastern Shore are extremely fortunate to have the volunteer work of these dedicated attorneys,\" Girard said. \"And we are always looking for more attorneys to become volunteers with us and who share our passion for providing access to legal representation in civil matters for everyone, regardless of anyone's ability to pay.\"Shore Legal Access was founded as Mid-Shore Pro Bono in 2005 by a small group of dedicated and compassionate local judges and attorneys, who recognized the overwhelming need for basic civil legal services in the five Mid-Shore counties.It became the first regional pro bono organization in Maryland to connect private attorneys with people unable to afford representation for their civil legal issues.Since then, Shore Legal Access has been dedicated to making representation affordable and accessible to Eastern Shore residents facing civil legal challenges in the areas of family law, life planning, consumer debt relief, housing and criminal record expungement, including cannabis-related records.Each year, Shore Legal Access connects more than 3,000 individuals with legal help they might otherwise not have received, ensuring that justice truly is for all. \n \n Caption: Shore Legal Access of Easton and Salisbury recently presented its Volunteer Attorney of the Year awards as part of the annual National Celebration of Pro Bono.

How do I address this without making it confrontational? - Crossing the LineDEAR CROSSING THE LINE: Decide what you want to share with this friend and what is off limits. Take the time to think about this since it seems to come up a lot. Also think about why this person keeps asking.Are they naturally nosy? Do they want to help you? What is their motivation for the constant questioning? Next time they come with the barrage of questions, stop them. Ask them \"why\" questions: Why are you asking me about this? Why do you want to know? Get them to open up and share what's on their mind.People are generally so fixated on themselves that these answers are probably all about them. It could be that they are fascinated by how you live the life you do.They could be curious about how you are able to manage your expenses based on their perception of your income compared to theirs. They may be envious that you can afford things they cannot.Ask so that you can learn.Even so, you do not have to answer. When questions come up that go past your comfort level, you can simply not respond. Allow silence to fill the space. You can say you do not want to talk about that. You can say that topic is off limits. You can ask them to stop with the inquisition. You don't owe them anything.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist and founder of DREAMLEAPERS, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

Families would gather mid-morning (around 10 or 11 a.m.) bringing their favorite breakfast casseroles to share.The children of all ages got to enjoy their gifts before traveling. Some years, it would be at the grandparents' place but other members began taking turns also.Enjoy today's recipes to share with everyone and send some of your favorites to me at mmsavage21145@gmail.com so I can share with the readers.PANCAKE CASSEROLE Cooking spray, pancakes, 6 large eggs, 1.5 cups heavy cream, 1 cup whole milk, 25 cup granulated sugar, 1 tsp vanilla bean paste, .25 tsp kosher salt, unsalted butter and maple syrup (for serving).Lightly coat a 13-by 9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.

The Tides of Grace annual event made Christmas magic for a multitude of families as hundreds of free toys were picked out by parents needing an extra hand with the holidays.\n\"Someone is either going through a storm or entering a chapter of the storm,\" said Leann Rhodes, the driving force behind Tides of Grace, who counts her own experience as proof.\n\" When I was in college, I was a young mom working three jobs, putting myself through college full time and raising a one-year-old daughter. Having a helping hand through food banks helped when I barely had money left for groceries after I paid bills.\"\nWhen Rhodes became an elementary school teacher in a low-income school, the experience opened her eyes to how many families could use a little extra help even though most of them held full-time jobs.\nFast forward to five years ago when her newborn was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer (from which he has since recovered), it was gratifying to have community support and a helping hand through small acts of kindness.\nRhodes' experiences were the foundation for what became Tides of Grace.\nShe describes it as representative of the Eastern Shore, the tides of life that come and go, and grace and relief offered in times of hardship. Four years ago the first seed was planted. In the midst of COVID and right before Christmas, Rhodes was clearing out her children's stash of toys to make room for new ones.\nShe posted them free on Facebook Marketplace.\n\"The woman who came for them began to cry,\" Rhodes remembers. \"She and her husband were out of work and had no idea how they would give Christmas to their children.\nIt got me thinking how many other families were struggling.\"\nRhodes got together with some friends to find out how many moms would donate their used toys. The resulting social media posts garnered enough donations to fill three garages.\nOn Dec. 2, Tides of Grace continued its fourth annual Christmas Magic Toy Drive, an event the organization describes as revolving around the simple, yet powerful, notion that every child deserves to feel the excitement and joy that the holiday season brings.\nFor a month, Tides of Grace has been collecting gently used toys for the event projected to be the largest ever. From the donations of gently used toys given by the community, they've filled a 40-foot shipping cargo container, three trailers, and an entire office.\nGiving an assist, Stevensville's Edge Arena donated its 25,000 square foot indoor soccer turf to display the toys. More than 50 dedicated community members joined in Saturday to help unload, sort, clean and make transform the arena into a winter wonderland for parents to shop for free.\nMultiple community partners served as drop off points for the toy collection and donated wrapping supplies.\nFrom free gift wrapping to a festive shopping experience, the Toy Drive once again created unforgettable memories, spreading cheer, and bringing everyone together.\nVisit Tides of Grace and Linktr.ee for more information on the organization, its programs, and how to donate and volunteer. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF TIDES OF GRACE\n\n Coming together in the early hours of Saturday morning, dozens of volunteers unload donated toys to be readied for pick up.\n\n COURTESY OF TIDES OF GRACE\n\n Dozens of wheeled toy trucks, planes, trains and more abound on the field at the annual toy gift away in Stevensville.\n\n COURTESY OF TIDES OF GRACE\n\n Gently used and new toys for babies to teens are on display waiting for families to pick out Christmas gifts. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "7-year-old surpasses goal in stocking Royal Oak food pantry\n\n January 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Local News \n \n 361\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROYAL OAK — Isla Henderson did more than just reach her goal of collecting 4,000 items for the Royal Oak Community United Methodist Church's food pantry — she surpassed it.In late October, the ambitious 7-year-old set out with a goal to collect thousands of of much-needed items for the church's food pantry as part of her Bay Hundred 4-H and Saddle, Paws and Steam 4-H Clover projects.\nIn just a few short weeks, she was a quarter of the way there.\nAnd by Christmas Eve, she crushed it.\nWith the help of the community, Isla collected 6,157 items for the food pantry, according to Tonya Hammond, Royal Oak Community UMC's food pantry coordinator.\nDonations came from every direction, said Lisa Roemer, who is also a food pantry coordinator with the church.\nBags of groceries were dropped off, online orders were placed, and the National Honor Society at St. Michaels Middle/High School, along with St. Michaels Elementary School, chipped in with collecting items for Isla's project.\nIn a text message sent by mom Christine Weber, Isla said she couldn't believe over 6,000 items had been collected and thanked everyone for helping her.\n\"Phew, it's a lot of work. Maybe we can get 10,000,\" Isla told her mom enthusiastically.\nWeber was also delighted with the community outpouring in helping her daughter collect items for the pantry.\n\"I am overwhelmed with joy and gratitude to everyone who helped Isla achieve her goal,\" she said via text message. \"We had so much help in this mission from the community. It has been a blessing in so many ways.\"\nNot only did the much-needed donations come in, but the church has seen a rise in visitors to the pantry as well, Roemer said.\nThe Royal Oak Community UMC food pantry is the only 24-hour pantry in Talbot County and feeds an estimated 20 to 30 households per week.\nFuture donations are always appreciated. Items can be dropped off day or night at a donation box in front of Precision Mobile Service, located at 8692 Brooks Drive in Easton. Donations can also be ordered online and shipped to the same address.\nThose in need can visit the food pantry, which is located at 6968 Bellevue Road in Royal Oak. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You have a fine contingent of local journalists who do an excellent job of covering the local scene (and deserve being listed on your masthead).Even your opinion pieces now draw more upon local writers rather than the nationally syndicated ones. The occasional pieces by Bill Peak are always engrossing and soul-searching.\nEven if some of your letter writers are a bit off-the-wall, it is wonderful that local citizens have such an outlet for expressing their views.\nYour obituaries give us important information, and you cover local sports well. In these days, when so many national commentators bemoan the demise of local newspapers as dying and dead (as did a piece in the Star Democrat a couple of weeks ago), you are an outstanding example of a thriving local newspaper.\nI only wish that more local people would become aware of that and add themselves to your list of subscribers.\nFOREST HANSEN\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-01-25",
    "author": "TALBOT INTERFAITH SHELTER",
    "content": "Talbot Interfaith Shelter celebrates 15 years of fighting homelessness on the Mid-Shore\n\n January 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TALBOT INTERFAITH SHELTER | Section: Local News \n \n 942\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Talbot Interfaith Shelter started off 2024 with a significant milestone.This month marks their 15th anniversary of serving the community's homeless neighbors. The organization has been through quite a journey to get to this point.\nTalbot Interfaith Shelter was formed in 2008 by a group of concerned members of Talbot County faith communities, who were alarmed by a growing number of requests for assistance from those who were hungry, homeless or about to become homeless.\nThe group, led by founder Evelyn Sedlack, hoped to be able to fill the gap to provide a safe haven for families in need.\nFor five years, Talbot Interfaith Shelter was a \"homeless\" homeless shelter — rotating cots, blankets, supplies and support through Talbot's faith congregations during the cold-weather months.\nTeams of volunteers from 19 faith communities came together to bring hot meals, drive guests to shower at the YMCA, make bagged lunches and provide fellowship for the shelter's guests. Guests had to leave in the morning and return in the evening to allow the churches and synagogue to conduct their regular business.\nDue to fire code restrictions in the houses of worship, Talbot Interfaith was only able to house five individuals per night. This restriction, coupled with the fact that they could not provide daytime shelter or house people year-round, made it nearly impossible to help families under the rotating shelter model.\nThe shelter began supporting one family at a time in an apartment rented to them in 2011.\nSince the need far surpassed the organization's capabilities, Talbot Interfaith began investigating buildings and properties with an eye toward a permanent facility to allow them to function year-round.\nAfter looking at various properties in Easton, shelter leaders began negotiations in early 2014 to purchase Easton's Promise, a former bed and breakfast at 107 Goldsborough Street.\nThat building, centrally located with five en suite bathrooms, large dining and living areas and a kitchen, offered a tremendous amount of flexibility.\nOn Sept. 15, 2016, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals upheld the shelter's permit to operate at Easton's Promise, allowing them to finalize the purchase of the building on Nov. 2, 2016.\nHaving a permanent facility not only enabled Talbot Interfaith to serve more people, but it allowed guests to stay longer, giving the organization the opportunity to develop a program that would address homelessness and its root causes, rather than than simply giving guests a temporary reprieve.\nTalbot Interfaith Shelter's innovative S4 Program (shelter, stability, support, success) was designed to address the unique challenges of rural homelessness.\nThe goal of S4 is to create sustainable change in the lives of local men, women and children, providing them with access to services and tools that can help them break the cycle of poverty and homelessness to reclaim their independence.\nThe S4 Program incorporates shelter, rigorous case management, connection with local service providers and life skills training to provide a full circle approach to homelessness.\nAfter launching the S4 Program, Talbot Interfaith began building partnerships with the Housing Commission of Talbot and several private landlords to procure more off-site transitional apartments.\nIn the spring of 2020, when the COVID crisis began, TIS leadership anticipated devastating economic repercussions for many in the community.\nIn April of 2020, TIS began actively exploring ways to expand their capacity to accommodate more people and help them through the challenges of homelessness. After many months of discussions and planning, the solution presented itself — directly next door to Easton's Promise at 109 Goldsborough Street.\nWith seven bedrooms, three full baths, a kitchen, meeting space, laundry facilities and more, this is a perfect setting for guests to regain stability as they work towards earning a spot in Talbot Interfaith's transitional housing program.\nAppropriately, on Nov. 17, 2020, during National Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week, the Easton Board of Zoning Appeals (BOZA) voted unanimously to approve Talbot Interfaith Shelter's permit to expand their services to 109 Goldsborough Street.\nDozens of supporters from across the community submitted suggestions to name the new building, and more than 1,000 people voted for the winner, Evelyn's Place, an homage to Talbot Interfaith's founder, Evelyn Sedlack, whose compassion and perseverance was the catalyst for what the shelter had grown to become.\nEvelyn's Place was designated as a shelter for single men and women, while Easton's Promise serves families with children.\nOn June 6, 2022, Evelyn's Place opened its doors for the first time. Within three weeks, every bed was filled with local men and women beginning their journey to self-sufficiency through the S4 Program.\nIn 2023, Talbot Interfaith Shelter served 112 people, including 27 single individuals and 19 families with 44 children.\nOf those served, one family graduated fully from the S4 Program and 16 single individuals and eight families moved from the shelter into one of Talbot Interfaith's 17 transitional apartments or directly into their own housing.\nGuests attended classes on basic life skills, poverty, parenting, budgeting, job readiness, relationships, and the Six Pillars of Character.\nCase managers helped with everything from recovering lost paperwork or identification to applying for disability and reunifying families.\nWhen asked about how it feels to be celebrating 15 years, Talbot Interfaith Executive Director Julie Lowe said, \"What TIS has become today, we owe to that small group of concerned citizens fifteen years ago, who saw their neighbors suffering and knew they had to do something to help. Out of that one meeting grew a community of thousands of volunteers and donors who have changed hundreds of lives for the better. It is incredible to watch our guests thrive and become more confident as they work to rebuild their lives, and we owe that all to this community and our amazing supporters.\"\nTo learn more about Talbot Interfaith Shelter and how you can help, visit talbotinterfaithshelter.org or contact Julie Lowe at julielowe@talbotinterfaithshelter.org or 410-310-2316. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hot chili on a cold day\n\n January 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1304\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A steaming pot of homemade chili is good on any day, but on a cold wintry day, it seems to taste so much better.Walking in the kitchen and smelling the aroma of a homemade soup of any kind just puts a smile on the family's face — especially the cook — as a one pot meal is much less work and clean up.\nChili seems to be a number one Super Bowl favorite, so as the stores are stocked today, closer to Feb. 11 they will be sold out. Get your recipes out, purchase your supplies early and be ready.\nFirst off I wanted to re-share an older cornbread recipe. When it comes to chili, I like a dryer cornbread that helps to soak up the chili flavor.\nCOUNTRY DRY CORN BREAD\n1 tbsp bacon drippings or cooking grease, 2 cups cornmeal or 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp sugar (optional), 1 large egg, 1 1/4 cups buttermilk, 6 tbsps unsalted butter (melted). Put the bacon drippings or grease in a 9 or 10-inch well seasoned cast iron skillet and put the skillet into the oven. Then preheat the oven to 400 degrees with the skillet inside. If you don't have an iron skillet, you can use an uncovered Dutch oven, or a metal cake pan. Whisk together all the dry ingredients (cornmeal, baking soda, salt, sugar if using) in a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the egg and buttermilk until combined, then mix that into the bowl of dry ingredients. Stir in the melted butter. When the oven is hot, take out the skillet (carefully). Add the cornbread batter and make sure it is evenly distributed in the skillet. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the edges are beginning to brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean. Let the bread rest for 10 to 30 minutes in the skillet before cutting it into wedges and serving.\nVENISON CHILI\nPlace one pound of boneless cubed venison steak and one pound pork sausage in a large skillet and cook, breaking with a wooden spoon as necessary, over medium heat until no longer pink. Drain grease and mix in 1 chopped onion, 2 minced cloves of garlic and c beans, drained, and cook for about 3 minutes. Drain and mix in one 6 ounce can tomato paste and season with hot pepper sauce, salt and black pepper to taste. Pour in one 15 ounce can cannellini beans, drained, and one 10 ounce can diced tomatoes with chilies. Pour all of this into a slow cooker, adding the venison-sausage mixture in with the tomato-bean mixture. Cook 8 to 10 hours on low or 5 hours on high. Serve with shredded Cheddar cheese.\nWENDY'S CHILI\nIn a large skillet brown 2 pounds of fresh ground beef. Drain off fat and put the beef in a 6 quart pot with 1 quart of tomato juice, one 15 ounce can of tomato puree, one 15 ounce can of drained red kidney beans, one 15 ounce can drained pinto beans, one large chopped onion, 1/2 cup diced celery, 1/4 cup diced green pepper, 1/4 cup chili powder, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 1/2 tsps garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. Cover and simmer for one hour, stirring often.\nINSTANT POT VEGGIE CHILI\n1 tbsp olive oil, 1 medium white or yellow onion (diced), 1 medium red bell pepper (diced), 4 cloves garlic (minced), 3–4 cups vegetable stock, 1 (15-oz) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, 1 (15-oz) can beans of your choice (rinsed and drained), 1 cup uncooked green or brown lentils (picked over and rinsed), 1 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp ground cumin, salt and freshly-cracked black pepper. Some extras that go great with this are diced avocado, chopped fresh cilantro, diced green or red onions, shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and/or crumbled corn tortilla chips.\nPress the \"Sauté\" button on the Instant Pot. Add oil, followed by the onion and red pepper. Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion has softened. Add garlic and sauté for 1 more minute, stirring occasionally. Press the \"Cancel\" button. Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl of the Instant Pot. Place the lid on and set to \"Sealing.\" Using the \"Manual\" button, cook the chili on high pressure for 12 minutes, followed by a quick release. Taste and season with salt and pepper (or any other additional seasonings) as needed. Serve immediately, piled high with all of your favorite toppings. Or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.\nIf you prefer to use a slow cooker, add all ingredients to the bowl of a slow cooker and stir briefly to combine. Cover and cook on high for 3-4 hours or on low for 6-8 hours, until the lentils are tender. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve immediately, piled high with all of your favorite toppings. Or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.\nOLD FASHIONED CHILI\n2 pounds 85% lean ground beef, 1 tbsp canola oil, 2 sweet onions (diced), 4 cloves garlic (sliced), 1 red pepper (diced), 1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes, 2 15-ounce cans dark red kidney beans (drained), 2 15-ounce cans pinto beans (drained), 2 tbsps dark chili powder, 1 tbsp cumin, 1 tsp ground chipotle pepper, ½ cup chicken stock, 2 tbsps smoked paprika, 1 11-ounce can tomato juice such as V8, salt and freshly ground black pepper, shredded cheese, sour cream, green onions. My son John likes to dice Red Onions up for his chili, so that is an option as well. In a large soup pot over medium-high heat, add the canola oil and ground beef. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Sear for about 10 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and red pepper, and sauté about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, beans, chili powder, cumin, chipotle powder, paprika, chicken stock and tomato juice; simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, green onion, tortilla chips or crackers.\nTEXAS STYLE CHILI\n1–2 tbsps avocado or vegetable oil, 2 1/2 to 3 pounds beef chuck roast (fat trimmed, cut into 3-inch cubes), 2 1/2 tsps salt (1 tsp per pound of meat, more to taste), 1 yellow onion (finely diced), 5 cloves garlic (minced), 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp cumin, 1/4 cup chili powder, 2 4.5-ounce cans green chiles, 1 14-ounce can crushed fire roasted tomatoes. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Toss the cut beef chunks with salt. Add the beef to the pot and let it cook, undisturbed, for a few minutes on each side until it gets nice and browned. You may need to do these batches depending on the size of your pan. Remove beef chunks and transfer to the slow cooker.\nAdd onions and garlic (and a bit more oil if needed); sauté until golden and softened. This process should lift a lot of browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the brown sugar and spices; sauté for 3-5 minutes until nice and fragrant. Add green chiles and crushed tomatoes; simmer for 3-5 minutes until bubbly and delicious. Pour tomato mixture into the slow cooker over the beef chunks; gently nudge them around so they are surrounded in the sauce. Cook on high for 4-ish hours or low for 8 hours. Shred the beef into big tender chunks (you should be able to do this directly in the slow cooker) and season with more salt to taste. Serve with sour cream, cheddar, green onions and cornbread. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

But how do we receive them?\nWe wait.\nWe are often like children at Christmas, who see quite clearly the many presents wrapped under the tree yet chafe at the insistence of their parents they \"wait\" before opening.\nJesus did not leave us without direction in this manner. He has shown us the way through the Holy Scriptures, the Word of God. If we would simply read and believe no possible doubt could remain.\nI was 45 years old before I became a daily reader of God's word, and in so doing my character flaw of impatience (one of many) slowly — ever so slowly, I must say — faded away.\nThe more I read the more I was able to wait for the Lord. I was given a sense of peace that all will be well. Oh if I'd only been a student of the Bible sooner, I could have saved myself much heartache and missteps.\nAccording to the Bible, all who desire the grace of God are to wait for it through the means He has already ordained: daily Bible reading and prayer and weekly fellowship with other believers.\nIt's not complicated, but it's also not easy if you've spent a lifetime leading yourself.\nC.S. Lewis said, \"Oftentimes in order to go forward we must go back and begin again.\"\nNow is the day and time, as this New Year is upon us to begin again and wait for the Lord to lead and bless. Amen. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Hot chili on a cold day\n\n January 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1304\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A steaming pot of homemade chili is good on any day, but on a cold wintry day, it seems to taste so much better.Walking in the kitchen and smelling the aroma of a homemade soup of any kind just puts a smile on the family's face — especially the cook — as a one pot meal is much less work and clean up.\nChili seems to be a number one Super Bowl favorite, so as the stores are stocked today, closer to Feb. 11 they will be sold out. Get your recipes out, purchase your supplies early and be ready.\nFirst off I wanted to re-share an older cornbread recipe. When it comes to chili, I like a dryer cornbread that helps to soak up the chili flavor.\nCOUNTRY DRY CORN BREAD\n1 tbsp bacon drippings or cooking grease, 2 cups cornmeal or 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp sugar (optional), 1 large egg, 1 1/4 cups buttermilk, 6 tbsps unsalted butter (melted). Put the bacon drippings or grease in a 9 or 10-inch well seasoned cast iron skillet and put the skillet into the oven. Then preheat the oven to 400 degrees with the skillet inside. If you don't have an iron skillet, you can use an uncovered Dutch oven, or a metal cake pan. Whisk together all the dry ingredients (cornmeal, baking soda, salt, sugar if using) in a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the egg and buttermilk until combined, then mix that into the bowl of dry ingredients. Stir in the melted butter. When the oven is hot, take out the skillet (carefully). Add the cornbread batter and make sure it is evenly distributed in the skillet. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the edges are beginning to brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean. Let the bread rest for 10 to 30 minutes in the skillet before cutting it into wedges and serving.\nVENISON CHILI\nPlace one pound of boneless cubed venison steak and one pound pork sausage in a large skillet and cook, breaking with a wooden spoon as necessary, over medium heat until no longer pink. Drain grease and mix in 1 chopped onion, 2 minced cloves of garlic and c beans, drained, and cook for about 3 minutes. Drain and mix in one 6 ounce can tomato paste and season with hot pepper sauce, salt and black pepper to taste. Pour in one 15 ounce can cannellini beans, drained, and one 10 ounce can diced tomatoes with chilies. Pour all of this into a slow cooker, adding the venison-sausage mixture in with the tomato-bean mixture. Cook 8 to 10 hours on low or 5 hours on high. Serve with shredded Cheddar cheese.\nWENDY'S CHILI\nIn a large skillet brown 2 pounds of fresh ground beef. Drain off fat and put the beef in a 6 quart pot with 1 quart of tomato juice, one 15 ounce can of tomato puree, one 15 ounce can of drained red kidney beans, one 15 ounce can drained pinto beans, one large chopped onion, 1/2 cup diced celery, 1/4 cup diced green pepper, 1/4 cup chili powder, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 1/2 tsps garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. Cover and simmer for one hour, stirring often.\nINSTANT POT VEGGIE CHILI\n1 tbsp olive oil, 1 medium white or yellow onion (diced), 1 medium red bell pepper (diced), 4 cloves garlic (minced), 3–4 cups vegetable stock, 1 (15-oz) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, 1 (15-oz) can beans of your choice (rinsed and drained), 1 cup uncooked green or brown lentils (picked over and rinsed), 1 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp ground cumin, salt and freshly-cracked black pepper. Some extras that go great with this are diced avocado, chopped fresh cilantro, diced green or red onions, shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and/or crumbled corn tortilla chips.\nPress the \"Sauté\" button on the Instant Pot. Add oil, followed by the onion and red pepper. Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion has softened. Add garlic and sauté for 1 more minute, stirring occasionally. Press the \"Cancel\" button. Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl of the Instant Pot. Place the lid on and set to \"Sealing.\" Using the \"Manual\" button, cook the chili on high pressure for 12 minutes, followed by a quick release. Taste and season with salt and pepper (or any other additional seasonings) as needed. Serve immediately, piled high with all of your favorite toppings. Or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.\nIf you prefer to use a slow cooker, add all ingredients to the bowl of a slow cooker and stir briefly to combine. Cover and cook on high for 3-4 hours or on low for 6-8 hours, until the lentils are tender. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve immediately, piled high with all of your favorite toppings. Or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.\nOLD FASHIONED CHILI\n2 pounds 85% lean ground beef, 1 tbsp canola oil, 2 sweet onions (diced), 4 cloves garlic (sliced), 1 red pepper (diced), 1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes, 2 15-ounce cans dark red kidney beans (drained), 2 15-ounce cans pinto beans (drained), 2 tbsps dark chili powder, 1 tbsp cumin, 1 tsp ground chipotle pepper, ½ cup chicken stock, 2 tbsps smoked paprika, 1 11-ounce can tomato juice such as V8, salt and freshly ground black pepper, shredded cheese, sour cream, green onions. My son John likes to dice Red Onions up for his chili, so that is an option as well. In a large soup pot over medium-high heat, add the canola oil and ground beef. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Sear for about 10 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and red pepper, and sauté about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, beans, chili powder, cumin, chipotle powder, paprika, chicken stock and tomato juice; simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, green onion, tortilla chips or crackers.\nTEXAS STYLE CHILI\n1–2 tbsps avocado or vegetable oil, 2 1/2 to 3 pounds beef chuck roast (fat trimmed, cut into 3-inch cubes), 2 1/2 tsps salt (1 tsp per pound of meat, more to taste), 1 yellow onion (finely diced), 5 cloves garlic (minced), 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp cumin, 1/4 cup chili powder, 2 4.5-ounce cans green chiles, 1 14-ounce can crushed fire roasted tomatoes. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Toss the cut beef chunks with salt. Add the beef to the pot and let it cook, undisturbed, for a few minutes on each side until it gets nice and browned. You may need to do these batches depending on the size of your pan. Remove beef chunks and transfer to the slow cooker.\nAdd onions and garlic (and a bit more oil if needed); sauté until golden and softened. This process should lift a lot of browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the brown sugar and spices; sauté for 3-5 minutes until nice and fragrant. Add green chiles and crushed tomatoes; simmer for 3-5 minutes until bubbly and delicious. Pour tomato mixture into the slow cooker over the beef chunks; gently nudge them around so they are surrounded in the sauce. Cook on high for 4-ish hours or low for 8 hours. Shred the beef into big tender chunks (you should be able to do this directly in the slow cooker) and season with more salt to taste. Serve with sour cream, cheddar, green onions and cornbread. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Celebrating 95 years, Vietnam vet reflects on war, rescue efforts\n\n February 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1031\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Samuel Tiller, celebrated his 95th birthday on Nov. 25. Although he's safe at home, he sometimes stares up at the ceiling, tears in his eyes, reliving those times in the rice field.That's due to the fact he was in a firefight in the Vietnam War, where he rescued soldiers under him.\nAfter a hellish conflict, he considers himself lucky.\nThe Army gave him the purple heart and the bronze star for his bravery — luck not mentioned.\nOn his certificate it read: \"Sergeant Tiller distinguished himself by heroic actions during the Operation on 12-14, April 1964, in the Republic of Vietnam.\"\nAs much as the military is known for detail, that statement doesn't paint the picture of Sgt. 1st Class Tiller.\nIn his career he did everything from transporting officers, to drill sergeant to training the Vietnamese army. Starting in Maryland, he went from Germany, to Korea, and ultimately to Vietnam.\nAnd he doesn't have any regrets.\nFrom an early age living in Big Woods, near Worton, Tiller wanted to be a soldier. He got that chance, enlisting during a time when the military was segregated. While in the Army, he suffered prejudice, but also received advice from grizzled World War II veterans.\nThey told him to advance in rank as a Black man, he had to go to the Korean War front.\nTiller remembered the heaving ocean waves as he and others climbed a rope ladder to get onboard the ship to Korea. He was fortunate being there in the waning years of the conflict.\n\"I didn't receive a scratch on me,\" Tiller said.\nIt was not unproductive. He went from a \"nothing to an E-5.\"\nA sergeant, finally, after serving for ten years.\nTiller's time in Korea allowed him to pay for his first car when he returned to Chestertown where Mary, his future wife lived.\nLike many, the military life called him back.\nSoon after, Tiller was sent to another war, Vietnam, to his wife's great concern.\nShe'd write him every day until he was home safe.\nTiller's role was to assist the company commander as they trained the Vietnamese army to fight the Vietcong. He moved with the Vietnamese in convoys, mingling with them, while they loaded up their chickens, rabbits, pots, pans and everything they owned.\nClose calls while in-country remain fresh on Tiller's mind.\nOne balmy Sunday, a battalion of Vietcong attacked a village in Tam Phu. Tiller boarded a helicopter along with other companies — 16 Huey choppers and four Piasecki H-21's, called \"banana choppers.\"\nTiller said his helicopter was doorless, and two fifty-caliber gunners thundered fire down on the Vietcong below when they approached the landing zone; an open field. Unable to hear a sound except gunfire and propellers, Tiller and the company commander evacuated, retreating for the tail of the chopper.\nVietcong were in the woodline to the left, firing on Tiller's men.\nHugging the ground, they deployed a \"fire and maneuver\" action. Some soldiers engaged the enemy allowing others to retreat to the woodline.\nScrambling for it, they jumped into a ditch, pinning them down. Someone threw smoke to show their location to air support, but the dry brush caught fire. Immediately, they were caught between a spreading fire and the enemy.\nWith bullets bearing down on him, Tiller pulled one of the wounded Vietnamese from the part of the ditch that was closer to the fire. They were in a hopeless situation, but thankfully the smoke did its job.\nA tactical fighter squadron dropped a napalm bomb on the enemy, allowing Tiller's company to retreat to the woodline.\nTiller said, \"If it wasn't for that plane I wouldn't be here today.\"\nBut the Vietcong were a continual presence.\nEvery time a plane dropped a flare that night, mortars would fire off.\nThe next morning, they tried to get down a river for pickup, and Vietcong pushed them back to the woodline.\nDuring that conflict, three of Tiller's guys were wounded.\nRisking his life, he told the company commander to lay down fire and cover him.\n\"I brought those guys back by myself, one at a time,\" Tiller remarked.\nThe assault continued throughout that day.\nMonday evening, a helicopter made an attempt to rescue six wounded. The enemy lurked in the woods. The helicopter had to retreat because they opened up fire again.\nFor almost three days, the threat of danger and death was imminent.\nOn Tuesday morning, the violence was drowned out by calm.\nWithin that silence, a chopper brought the Vietnamese Colonel and an American Major.\nThis time the enemy didn't fire back.\nU.S. forces delivered water to the war-weary and parched soldiers.\nThen they marched single-file beside the river towards the special forces camp to get picked up. Tiller was behind 15 men, but he alone set off a land mine. It knocked him down and broke two toes, with the shrapnel from the explosion striking the commander.\nTiller, who carried so many others, was carried himself, then placed on a small boat and then helicopter-bound for Saigon.\nFour-Star Gen. Wes Mooreland had visited wounded soldiers in the hospital every Sunday. On one of those times, he asked Tiller how he was. Tiller said he's alright physically but his morale was down. He hadn't received any letters from Mary since he was there.\nOrders were given.\nIf Tiller had any mail in Vietnam, Mooreland would make sure he got it.\nThat Monday after coming back from the chow hall, there were a pile of her letters on Tiller's bed.\nIt was the boost Tiller needed.\nTiller recovered and reported to headquarters, received a scolding typical of military life and was soon on the way to the Philippines. He received a hero's steak dinner, and then took a double-decker plane from California back to Philadelphia.\nTiller still sees Vietnam.\n\"It stays with you,\" he said.\nTiller retired from the Army in 1967. He became an employee in the Air Force working roads and grounds. A steady job, away from danger, where he could be alone with his thoughts.\nHe had a good career there. In New Jersey, where he lived, he was known for his impeccably kept yard and as, \"Big Sam the Fish Fry Man,\" cooking fish on weekends.\nOn his 95th birthday, he celebrated with his family in Chestertown with a big cookout.\nTough-as-nails, a sharp wit, and a natural storyteller, Sfc. Tiller shakes his head, \"War is hell. I know. I been through two of them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Advice to both teams — as the kids in the '70s and '80s used to say, \"give it your best shot.\" Our column this week will be recipes from the cities of former Super Bowl winners. Starting off will be two recipes from the cities of the two teams playing this weekend.\nSAN FRANCISCO SOURDOUGH BREAD\n4 ¾ cups bread flour (or more as needed), 3 tbsps white sugar, 2 ½ tsps salt, 1 package active dry yeast, 1 cup warm milk, 2 tbsps margarine (softened), 1 ½ cups sourdough starter, 1 extra large egg, 1 tbsp water, ¼ cup chopped onion. Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl. Add warm milk and margarine. Add in the starter mix. Mix in the remaining 3 3/4 cups of flour gradually; you may need to add more flour depending on the climate. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes. Place dough into a greased bowl, turn once to the oil surface, and cover. Allow to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\nPunch down dough; cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Divide dough in half and shape into two loaves. Place loaves on a greased baking pan. Allow to rise until doubled in volume, about one hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Stir together egg and water in a small bowl until well combined. Brush over the tops of loaves, then sprinkle with onion. Bake in the preheated oven until the loaves are golden brown and cooked through, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a loaf should read 190 degrees.\nKANSAS CITY BRISKET BURNT ENDS\n1 Chuck Roast (about 3-4 lbs), 2 tbsp favorite BBQ seasoning, 1 tbsp canola oil. SAUCE: ¾ cup ketchup, ½ cup apple cider vinegar, 1.5 tbsp hot sauce, 1 tbsp brown sugar, ½ tbsp garlic paste, ½ tbsp Worcestershire sauce, salt to taste. Cube your chuck roast into 1\" size cubes and place in a bowl. Lather with canola oil and then season with BBQ seasoning. Place the cubes onto a baking tray with about ½ inch separation between each cube. Place in the fridge for 1 hour to set, then let come to room temperature 15 minutes before cooking. Preheat a grill or smoker using a two-zone fire with Charcoal to 275 degrees. Add some hickory chunks or chips for added smoke flavor.\nPlace the beef onto the smoker to cook for about 1.5 hours until they begin to soften. As the beef smokes, heat up a medium high fire for the BBQ sauce. Add a skillet with the ingredients for the BBQ sauce and let simmer until thickened. Once warm and well incorporated, pull the BBQ sauce off the heat to cool. After 1.5 hours on the smoker, pull the beef off and place into a medium size foil bin. Top the burnt ends with the BBQ sauce and mix around. Cover the bin with aluminum foil and place back on the smoker to cook for another 2.5 hours. Add more BBQ sauce if needed so that there is a decent amount of liquid in order to break down the burnt ends. Once the burnt ends are tender and can easily break apart, pull them off and let cool for 10 minutes. Toss the cooled burnt ends in some of the foil bins sauce, season with a little more BBQ seasoning. To make the most authentic burnt ends at home, you will need a smoker, but you can make them on a gas or charcoal grill.\nNEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER\n4 slices bacon, 1 large onion (chopped), 2 celery ribs (chopped), 1 clove garlic (minced), 1/4 tsp dried thyme or 1 tsp fresh, 3 small potatoes (peeled and cubed), 1 cup water, 1 (8 ounce) bottle clam juice, 1 tbsp chicken base, 2 cups half and half (divided), 1/3 cup all-purpose flour, 2 (6 ½ ounce) cans chopped clams undrained, salt and freshly ground black pepper. In a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat, add bacon and cook until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon from the pot, drain on paper towels, and crumble. Set aside. To the bacon fat, add onion and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and thyme until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nStir in potatoes, water, clam juice and chicken base. Bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered until potatoes are tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 cup half-and-half and flour until smooth. Gradually stir into soup, return to a simmer, and cook until thickened, about 1 to 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper (I like 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper). Add clams and their juice and remaining 1 cup half-and-half and stir until heated through, about 1 minute. Garnish each serving with bacon and oyster crackers.\nMARYLAND CRAB SOUP\n2 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes, 3 cups water, 2 cups beef broth, 1 cup fresh lima beans, 1 cup frozen corn kernels, 1 cup sliced carrots, 2 tbsps chopped onion, 2 tbsps Old Bay Seasoning (or if you are like this girl you'll need more), 1 gallon water, 10 blue crab claws (steamed), 1 pound blue crabmeat. Place stewed tomatoes, 3 cups water, beef broth, lima beans, corn, sliced carrots, chopped onion and Old Bay seasoning in a 4-quart pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cover and cook for 5 minutes. Bring 1 gallon water to a boil in a large pot. Add crab claws and boil for 6 minutes; drain. Stir crabmeat and boiled crab claws into tomato and vegetable mixture. Cover and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Serve hot. Adding a little Worcestershire sauce also gives this an extra kick.\nPHILLY CHEESECAKE\n1 ½ cups Honey Maid graham cracker crumbs, ⅓ cup butter or margarine (melted), 3 tbsps sugar, 4 (8 ounce) packages Philadelphia cream cheese (softened), 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 4 eggs. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Mix crumbs, butter and 3 tbsps sugar until combined; press firmly onto the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Beat cream cheese, 1 cup sugar and vanilla in a mixing bowl until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed until just blended. Pour over the crust. Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, about 55 minutes. Loosen cake from the pan rim; cool before removing rim. Refrigerate for 4 hours before serving.\nCAJUN SEAFOOD BOIL\n3 quarts water, 1 (12-ounce) can of beer (optional but highly recommended and can be non alcoholic), 3 tbsps Cajun seasoning, 1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning, hot sauce to taste, 1 medium yellow onion (roughly sliced into half-moons), 1 large lemon (cut into wedges) plus more for serving, 12 ounces andouille sausage (sliced into rounds), 1 lb baby potatoes (red, gold or a mix of both), 1 lb pre-cooked snow crab leg clusters (fresh or frozen), 1 — 1 ½ lbs jumbo shrimp, (deveined, shell-on or peeled), 4–6 ears sweet corn on the cob. In an extra large stockpot or dutch oven (about 10 quarts or larger) over medium-high heat, combine the water and beer (if using). Bring the liquid to a boil. Then season the boil with the Cajun seasoning, Old Bay seasoning, and a few dashes of hot sauce. Add the sliced onion and lemon wedges into the pot. Stir all the ingredients well to thoroughly combine. Let the mixture boil for 15 minutes. Carefully add the andouille sausage rounds and baby potatoes into the pot, stirring well to fully combine with the boil. Let the andouille and potatoes cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are just about fork-tender. Gently nestle the snow crab clusters into the pot along with the shrimp and corn on the cob. Be sure that everything is fully submerged under the boil and carefully stir to ensure all ingredients are well combined. Continue boiling for another 5 to 7 minutes, cooking until the shrimp is pink.\nMay the best team win! \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "What's for dinner?\n\n February 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1390\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n That familiar question pops up this time of the year as we are all in the same predicament — what is for dinner tonight?The cook needs new suggestions, and the diners don't care as long as it is not the same old dishes. Well friends, let me try to make you all happy and even give you a laugh or two.\nLet's travel back down to farm country and visit the good ol' boys on a wintry Saturday morning. They just ate a breakfast consisting of fresh fried eggs, fried potatoes, mama's fresh baked biscuits and a couple slices of scrapple from the last hog killing.\nThe boys are ready to trap, catch, chase and hunt new meat. The brothers are used to these adventures and the boys from town love the fun.\nAs they speed off, Mom and I start our Saturday morning chores and wonder what these boys will bring home today?\nScreeching tires, barking dogs and loud music tell us the \"boys are back.\" It is about 1 p.m., and they start unloading the \"supply.\" First we see muskrats, then rabbits, then a deer and then ... the biggest bull frogs ever. At this point I am leaving for my babysitting job in town.\nNext week, we'll go even further into our trapping days for some good \"wild game recipes.\" Well, hop right on in the kitchen and try something different for dinner tonight.\nFROG LEGS\n12 frog's legs, 2 eggs, 1 small jug lemon juice, 2 parsley sprigs, chopped dried bread crumbs, salt and pepper (to taste), oil. Preheat the oven at 375 degrees. Remove skin from frog legs. Wash and drain. Add lemon juice, salt and pepper to frog legs. Beat eggs in a separate bowl. Add chopped parsley. Soak frog legs in the eggs. Roll frog legs in breadcrumbs. Add enough oil to a large pan to allow for frying. Fry frog legs in the oven for 3 to 4 minutes.\nSLOW BRAISED OX TAILS\n4-5 oxtails, 4 large carrots (peeled and finely chopped), 1 onion (finely chopped), 2 stalks celery (finely chopped), 5 garlic cloves (finely chopped), 3 bay leaves, 2 sprigs rosemary, 14oz chopped tomatoes, 4 cups beef stock, salt and pepper to taste. Season the oxtail generously with salt. In a large pot set over high heat, brown the oxtail in batches. Remove and set aside. Add the onions, celery and carrots and cook until golden and just starting to soften. Add the garlic and herbs and sauté for another minute. Add the tomatoes and the oxtail back to the pot. Pour in the stock, just enough to cover the oxtail. Reserve the rest. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat, cover and simmer gently for 3 hours. Check every 45 minutes if the oxtail needs more stock and top up as needed. Remove the lid for the last hour of cooking to allow the sauce to reduce. Serve the soft oxtail with mashed potatoes, polenta or rice.\nRABBIT STEW\n3 to 4 lbs rabbit, 6 potatoes (quartered), 8 carrots (sliced), 1 medium onion (chopped), 1 tsp salt, 1/4 cup beef consommé, 3/4 cup beef broth, 3/4 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp basil, 2 bay leaves, 1/4 tsp rosemary, 1/4 tsp thyme. Cut rabbit into pieces. Layer onion, potatoes, and carrots in the bottom of a crock pot. Add spices to the pot. Add rabbit, salt, pepper, consommé, and about 3/4 cup beef broth. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours. Thicken gravy as desired and serve hot.\nBISON SLOPPY JOES\n1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, 1 medium yellow onion (chopped, 1 red bell pepper (seeds and ribs removed, chopped), 1/2 cup ketchup, 2 cloves garlic (finely chopped), 1 tbsp chili powder, 2 tbsps apple cider vinegar, 2 tbsps yellow mustard, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 1 lb. ground Bison beef, 1 cup canned tomato sauce, 6 hamburger buns. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook onion and bell pepper, stirring occasionally, until softened and slightly golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Add ketchup and cook, stirring occasionally, until color has darkened and ketchup is reduced to a thick paste, 7 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and chili powder and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add vinegar, mustard, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until incorporated, about 1 minute more. Increase heat to high and add ground beef. Using a fork, break apart beef until separated and no big lumps remain. Cook, stirring frequently, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce and bring to a boil, stirring to combine. Let cool slightly; season with salt, if needed. Spread on buns or eat by itself.\nPIGS FEET\n4 lbs pig's feet, 1 tbsp cooking oil, 1 onion (coarsely chopped), 1 tbsp garlic (minced), 1 tsp thyme, ½ cup green bell pepper (coarsely chopped), ½ cup red bell pepper (coarsely chopped), ½ cup celery (coarsely chopped), 2 bay leaves, 1 tbsp bouillon powder, 1 tsp paprika, ½ cup white wine vinegar, 4-5 cups water, salt and pepper to taste, ½ tsp red pepper flake. Wash pig's feet in salt water, then scrub and rinse properly to ensure they are extra clean. Place a medium-size pot over medium heat. Add in cooking oil, onion, garlic and thyme. Saute for about 2-3 minutes. Then add bell peppers and celery and saute for another minute. Next, add pig's feet, bay leaves, bouillon, paprika, white wine vinegar and about 3 cups of water. Give everything a nice stir, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover pot and place pot over medium-high heat. Cook for about 2-3 hours, stirring periodically until the pig's feet are tender. Keep matching the pot to make sure water has not boiled out. If it has, add more.\nCRISPY ALLIGATOR BITES\n1 lb alligator meat tail or filet, 1 cup buttermilk, 1 tbsp Louisiana hot sauce, 1 cup flour, 1 tbsp Cajun seasoning, vegetable oil for frying. Cut the alligator into 1-2 inch pieces. Combine the buttermilk with the hot sauce, then add the alligator. Let it soak for 2-4 hours in the fridge. Mix the Cajun seasoning and flour together. Heat oil in a Dutch oven or other deep pot to 350 degrees. Oil should be about 3 inches deep. Dip the alligator pieces in the flour mixture then gently place them in the oil. Cook for 5-8 minutes, until golden brown on the outside. Cook in 3 batches to ensure each batch fries up crisp and non-greasy. Remove and drain on paper towels. Serve with Cajun remoulade sauce or dip in ranch dressing.\nBAKED OPOSSUM\n1 large opossum (skinned, dressed and washed), 4 tbsps Tabasco sauce, 1 1/2 tbsps salt, 2 onions (chopped), 1 clove garlic (minced), 2 tbsps Worcestershire sauce, 4 sweet potatoes, 2 ribs celery (chopped). Mix the salt, Tabasco sauce and Worcestershire sauce together. Place opossum in a large roasting pan. Sprinkle the celery, onions, and the garlic all over the opossum. Pour the liquid mixture over the opossum as well. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the sweet potatoes around the opossum. Bake covered for 1 1/2 hours. Baste once or twice with the marinade from the pan as the opossum cooks.\nHere are a few odd and fun ones to try with the kids when you have that restless Saturday or Sunday afternoon.\nFRITO PIE\n1cup corn chips, 1 cup prepared chili, 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese, 2 tsps chopped onions and mustard. Assemble by heating chili until warm either in a pot on the stove or in a microwave. Place corn chips in a bowl, pour over chili then top with the cheese, and onions if desired. Finish with a squirt of mustard.\nKOOL AID PICKLES\n1 (46 ounce) jar whole dill pickles, 1 cup sugar, 2 cups water, 2 (1 ounce) packets kool-aid unsweetened cherry drink mix. Drain and discard the juice from the pickle jar. Remove the pickles from the jar and cut each one in half lengthwise. Return the pickles to the jar and set aside. In a large measuring cup, combine the sugar, water and Kool-Aid. Mix until the sugar has completely dissolved. Pour enough of the liquid into the pickle jar to cover the pickles. Discard any excess. Cover the jar and refrigerate it for at least 24 hours. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He wants to start a local chapter of Veterans for Peace on the Eastern Shore.Veterans for Peace is an international group made up of veterans and allies who want to abolish war and serve the cause of peace. It was founded in 1985 and is based in St. Louis. The group relies on the philosophy of nonviolence.\n\"I am not anti military. We just want to make people realize what the military does,\" Butler said.\nHe said there is a cost on veterans' mental health and a cost to taxpayers associated with war. Veterans for Peace claims on their website that the total cost of the war on terror is over $9 trillion and growing.\nButler saw a need to create a local chapter.\n\"About a year and half ago I decided to see what I could do to start a chapter here on the Eastern Shore. They have a chapter in Baltimore. I just want to get it started and see how it develops,\" he said.\nIn an office supplied by the Easton Family YMCA at Peachblossom, Butler had many pamphlets and books about Veterans for Peace.\n\"Working for peace is important. It seems like one war after another after another,\" he said.\nThe YMCA has supplied a meeting space for the organization's first months, but Wendy Palmer, the YMCA's executive director, thinks the group will eventually outgrow the office space.\n\"Community is what keeps us going. (Butler's) purpose is to bring people together for peace. It is also a community of people who have some shared experiences,\" she said.\nButler said his faith has played a major role in shaping his beliefs on war.\n\"If I was put in the situation to kill another human being, could I do that? Loving our enemies is very difficult. It wasn't until I became a part of the Easton Church of the Bretheran, which is a peace church, that I learned the teachings of Jesus, that things fell into place for me. Is killing our enemies always the answer?\"\nButler got out of the Vietnam war in 1970. Two friends of his were wounded in the war. One did not come home at all and the other suffered from depression and drug addiction.\nButler said that he hopes creating the local chapter will help to do something about the cost of war.\nHe has scheduled to have Veterans for Peace's first meeting at the Easton Family YMCA at Peachblossom on Feb. 28 at 2 p.m.\nHe needs five people to start a chapter. The dues are $50 a year. Ellen Barfield, the national vice president of Veterans for Peace, will be at the first meeting to offer support.\nThis report has been updated to reflect the change in the Veterans for Peace meeting time. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: Salt of the earth\n\n February 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: REV. DANIEL T. GEDMAN St. Luke’s Methodist Church, Denton | Section: Columns \n \n 272\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Matthew 5:13 recounts Jesus' words, \"You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under peoples' feet.\"In the ancient world, salt had many functions. Of course, we know salt was widely used as a food preservative. It did not simply sit on the table waiting to cheer up a dull meal. It was also used as a \"rub\" of sorts for newborns (check out Ezekiel 16:4).\nStrictly speaking, salt cannot lose its saltiness because it (sodium chloride) is a stable compound. So, what is Jesus alluding to with this illustration?\nOne possibility is that the Lord is referring to the preservative function of salt — Christians are to live and act in the world to prevent its moral degeneration. But it has more than the negative function of stopping the world's deterioration.\nBy speaking and living the gospel, believers will improve the societies in which they live. That is, we sprinkle the salt of the gospel onto the world.\nChristians will turn the world aright when they submit to Christ. They should have no small ambitions; the whole earth will change through their salty influence. What was true for the first disciples is also true for us. We can serve Christ by applying the salt of anointed witness and service to the needs in our own locales.\nPray that we continue to salt our community with the salt of Christ's shed blood, that others may experience the true depth of God's life-preserving, regenerative power and not just the flavor of salt. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Thinking and reflecting\n\n March 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 467\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I am pleased that folks around Talbot County have a local news source that causes us to think and reflect upon who we are, what we think, what we believe and why, and how we act, or react, when those things that make us what we are, are challenged. In other words. Mr. Reel's thoughtful March 10 article was grounded in, or founded on, \"... don't confuse me with facts.\" That caused me to think about what I believe and why, how I tend to act, in my personal life and why, and to put down these words and thoughts, in reaction to his article.I do not know Mr. Reel or Ms. McCaskill personally, but Reel, being the chairman of the Republican Committee in Talbot County, clearly leans right, while Ms. McCaskill, being a former Democrat U.S. senator, clearly leans left. In my world that doesn't make either one of them bad people. It does mean they have biases, as we all do.\nThe thoughts expressed herein are an expression of how people's thoughts, views and \"truths\", can influence other people and how they strike me, personally.\nI have often expressed the view that we are all victims of our childhood, a more generous term would likely be products. I think it is a bit of both. I grew up in western Wisconsin, in a small town on the banks of the Mississippi. My mother was one of 13 children of Norwegian immigrants, who took up dairy farming in surrounding communities. My father, a World War II vet, was the son of German immigrants. Both he and his father were locomotive engineers for the CB&Q railroad, running trains between Chicago and St. Paul, Minnesota.\nMy mother's family was predictably Republican, while my father's family was Democrat. Nevertheless, I never heard one ill word about politics ever uttered at family gatherings. I have often said, growing up where I did, in the 1950s and 60s, there wasn't 10 cents worth of difference between good Republicans and good Democrats. I wonder if that is even possible, anymore.\nWhile I, perhaps we, long to return to those days, I know that is never going to happen. I would ask, however, if this were to be published, and if you were to read it, please think about how you and I can do better than to be steered by the political class to do real harm to those around us.\nWe all hear a lot of noise, some of it fact, some not, some honest opinion, some not, some well intentioned, too much not. However, we cannot, perhaps do not want to, tune it all out. What we can do is consider the sources and the potential outcomes, of words we hear and the paths we choose to take and espouse as a result.\nWILLIAM KEPPEN\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From the courtroom to the pulpit: New Newark pastor left a law career to join the ministry\n\n March 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 774\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As a defense lawyer, Dan McKenty represented corporate clients in front of judges at the courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware.In his new job, he helps his flock stay accountable to an even higher power.\nLast month, McKenty was hired as senior pastor at the First Presbyterian Church of Newark, his second pastoral role after making a mid-life career change and joining the ministry.\n\"People make jokes, they say, 'Well you get up and talk in front of people, so there are a lot of transferrable skills,\" McKenty said. \"And I say, well yeah, but in this job, I really do have to get the evidence right.\"\nThough his path to the pulpit was unorthodox, there's nowhere McKenty would rather be.\n\"I'm doing what God wants me to do,\" the 63-year-old said.\nMcKenty grew up in West Chester, Pa., and attended a Presbyterian church with his family.\nAs an adult, while he never lost his faith, religion took a backseat as he built his career and grew his family. Eventually, he made his way back to church, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was destined for something greater.\n\"God has a way of not being ignored, so I was called to the ministry,\" he said\n\"It wasn't really a blinding moment on the road to Damascus like Paul had,\" he added. \"I'm not going to lie to you and say it was that. It was just this growing passion for spreading the gospel.\"\nMcKenty would work all day as a lawyer, then drive to Philadelphia to take night classes at a seminary school. After four years of classes, he did a year of chaplaincy at Nemours Children's Hospital, giving him a crash course in comforting people in the worst moments of their life.\n\"That's my view of God,\" he said. \"God is in the emergency room when it all goes to hell. He's sitting there amongst a mascara-streaked mess of it all, feeling as [lousy] as everybody else. That's the God we have, and thank God we have that God.\"\nHis first pastoral job was at a small church in Ocean City, Md. After seven years, he was looking for a new challenge, and First Presbyterian was looking for a new pastor.\nIn the Presbyterian system, pastors are chosen by the congregation, not assigned by a bishop. Churches looking for a new pastor can search a computer database of candidates and then do interviews.\nA committee at First Presbyterian chose McKenty as a finalist, and McKenty came to the church to do a guest sermon.\n\"He wowed us with the sermon, and it was a unanimous vote,\" church elder Don Tancredi said.\nThe new pastor's laid-back, welcoming style has already won praise.\n\"You sit here and have a conversation with Pastor Dan, it's like I've known him for a long time,\" Tancredi said.\nFor McKenty, coming to Newark is a homecoming of sorts, considering he used to live in West Chester and work in Wilmington. He and his wife now live in Strasburg, Pa.\n\"This church has a lot of talent in it and has a great potential to expand the ministry that is already healthy and is already here,\" he said. \"So it was really an opportunity to do more than I was afforded in Ocean City.\"\nMcKenty hopes to lead First Presbyterian toward expanding its ministries.\n\"I'm going to take a little bit of time and get to know the area, and then together we're going to move forth joyfully and boldly in enlarging our footprint,\" he said, adding he wants to find more ways to take the church out into the community. \"Basically we want to live the gospel by meeting people where they are.\"\nOne particular focus will be the drug recovery community, which already uses the church for support group meetings.\n\"Those are people who are tackling a big uphill climb, and it takes a lot of bravery to begin and to reach the summit,\" McKenty said. \"I think it's a vital part of the gospel that we help in that.\"\nThe church recently completed a renovation project that enhanced its 600-seat chapel, including new pews, new carpet, new lighting and investments into equipment for live-streaming services.\nFirst Presbyterian, which will mark its 190th anniversary next year, sits on a 14-acre campus on West Main Street, including three buildings.\nIts 5,000-square-foot Westminister House — located between the main church and the Newark Country Club — presents a particularly exciting opportunity. The building is currently unused, and church officials are working on a plan to use it for programs that benefit the community.\nThat could include giving service organizations like the Newark Area Welfare Committee a permanent space there, Tancredi said. The church is also considering hosting a regular farmers market in the parking lot. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The religious leaders who brought her to Jesus, reminding Him that the law of Moses commanded her to be stoned, demanded Him to give His opinion.\nHe said to them, \"Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.\" One by one, they all walked away.\nThen Jesus asked her, \"Where are your accusers? Has no one condemned you?\" She said, \"No one, Lord.\" And Jesus said, \"Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.\" (John 8:11)\nThis is essentially what Jesus says to every forgiven sinner — \"Go, and from now on, sin no more.\"\nThe apostle Paul elaborates concerning this truth in Galatians 2:20: \"I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.\" What gets crucified with Christ is our old self — in other words, the way we lived before we experienced the saving grace of God. (Romans 6:6)\nThe world we live in is in desperate need of seeing people that are truly transformed by the power of God. This really is possible. To find out how, I challenge you to read Colossians 3:1–17.\nPaul Twining is the Caroline County coordinator for National Day of Prayer. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I look at it from the time I've come in and I look around [now]. A lot of friends have passed on and I wish they could have been here. It's been rewarding. It makes me feel that that I reached someone [to help].\"\n\"It's cool,\" said DAV Chapter 26 Vice Commander James Williams, who has been a member of the St. Mary's chapter the past three years. \"He won't tell you but he's the go-to guy. If you have questions or problems he has the information.\"\nGough said the DAV is an important resource for veterans; its website provides a calendar of upcoming events, services and 28 links veterans can click on to access forms and information.\n\"It's helped improve communication with other veterans,\" he said, \"and it does [benefit] claims which helps us increase our compensation, and for those who don't get compensation it helps them get theirs.\"\nThe DAV Chapter 26 is open 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Wednesdays at the Local Lodge 4 Machinist Union hall at 21795 Shangri-La Drive in Lexington Park. It has moved a few times over the past couple years.\n\"We don't have a home and we've been fighting that for years,\" Gough said. \"And if we did have a home where we could be open eights hours a day or whatever, we as veterans could come in and get together.\"\nGough was asked if the DAV is a type of fraternity for veterans.\n\"Yes it is, and once you get to know [the vets] and they start to come in and there's a bond that you never break,\" he said. \"My only downside is that I've met a lot of people who went to Vietnam and I had no overseas experience. I'm glad I didn't [have to go overseas], but it can be hard to bond [with those who have]. They have the stories and I can't imagine.\"\nGough graduated from Great Mills High School in 1968 and was drafted two years later. He was sent to Fort Holabird in Baltimore, then to Fort Dix, N.J., for eight weeks of basic training. He later attended Redstone Arsenal, Missile and Munition Center & School in Huntsville, Alabama, before being assigned to the 200th Ordnance Detachment GMGS Unit Training Command to begin on the job training. The GMGS is a type of grenade launcher.\nHe later went to Quartermaster School at Fort Lee, Virginia., to become a missile repair parts specialist, which he did the rest of his military career and made him eligible for promotion to E-5 Special Fifth Class.\nBecause of an injury to his foot, Gough received a medical discharge on Oct. 11, 1972.\n\"It helped me a lot,\" Gough said of the services he received from the DAV in the 1970s. \"They do it all for you. I've stayed around for 50 years just to see if I could help people.\"\n\"It's the most rewarding job I've had,\" Williams said. \"Every Wednesday my mind is set to help veterans, because every veteran has a different story.\"\nHe began working at the DAV in 1974 and has held several positions, including a stint as commander from 1993-1995.\n\"As long as I can move and have a little breathe [in me],\" Gough said, \"I'll always be there to help people.\"\nFor more about the St. Mary's County DAV Chapter 26, call 240-925-5439 or go to www.davch26stmarysmd.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I remember a pamphlet that showed sinners drowning in a literal lake of fire for all eternity. Scary stuff.Author and pastor Rob Bell presents us with an interesting thought though — do we really believe that God, who loves us so much, is going to condemn billions of people, and reward only a select few with heaven? Will He really condemn these billions, throughout history, with eternal torment for things they did in a few short years of their life on Earth? It's not a question I would presume to know the answer to.\nI do know this, just as well as you do — our God is a God of love. He loves us so much that He gave His only begotten Son. Therefore, I prefer to substitute \"fear\" with \"love.\" For instance, Proverbs 1:7 tells us, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. Fools despise wisdom and instruction.\" I like to think that \"the love of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.\"\nI must admit, I have no fear of the Lord. Instead, what I have is respect, reverence, awe, love and an appreciation of His love for me. The love He shows us cannot not be compared to anything else. The angels who appeared to the shepherds, in the Gospel of Luke, gave us good advice: \"Don't be afraid, because a savior is born.\"\nJesus came to us — God in the flesh — bringing love and salvation.\nIf we live a life of righteousness, following Christ, what do we have to fear? Nothing. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Some people disagree with what it says, or do not like the way it makes them feel about themselves.However, most people do not realize that when you read the Bible, you are entering into the spiritual realm of reasoning with God.\nGod desires us to reason with Him, and even invites us to does this in Isaiah 1:18.\n\"Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\"\nHow is this even possible?\nReasoning with God always gives birth to questions within our hearts and minds. Those questions cause us to seek Him and find answers.\nGod is not afraid of your hardest questions. The ultimate thing He wants you to know is that He loves you so much that He sent His on begotten son to die for your sins, so that if you will turn from your sin, confess Jesus as your Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be forgiven and saved from His coming judgement on this sinful world.\nSo read your Bible, and start in the Gospel of John. God is waiting to reason with you, and you will not regret it.\nEd Connaster is pastor of Refuge Christian Fellowship Church. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Fun on a bun: hot dog recipes for summer weather\n\n May 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: News \n \n 1324\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The last few days of school are nearing, graduations and proms are in process, last minute exams are being held and the calendar is already filling for June.One thing is certain — two to three meals a day still need to be prepared, and today I am here to put a smile on your face and a hot dog in your tummy.\nI was a sophomore in high school when my mother became ill and had to go to Baltimore for treatment Monday through Thursday and would return home on Friday afternoon. My sister was married and prepared food several nights each week.\nMy job was to cook for my dad and three younger brothers several nights each week. Well, thanks to the Esskay Company, I became a professional hot dog and burger queen.\nOne night it would be hot dogs on a bun, the next night it would be burgers on buns, and then the third night it would be their choice — burger or dogs.\nI made it nice for them. I would have a platter all filled with chopped and sliced onions, sliced tomatoes, relishes, sliced pickles, mustard and ketchup. I was so proud of how nice the table looked and the cleanup was so quick and easy.\nOne of my brothers told mom years later that he did not eat hot dogs or burgers for many years, and my dad said his heartburn problems came from overeating burgers and hot dogs. My baby brother said he always wondered \"where are the fries\" but never asked.\nI cannot move on with recipes until I tell you about my brief experience with the hot dog toaster.\nI found a hot dog toaster while shopping one day. It looked exactly like a regular toaster, but the slots were wider and only held 4 hot dogs. I anxiously proceeded to try this great invention — no boiling water in the saucepan with a drop of vinegar (for relief of heartburn my dad would say), no having to drag out the grill or the iron fry pan.\nI was smiling as I prepared my sides when the dogs started burning. I couldn't get the release button to work, and they kept burning. Through the smell and smoke I quickly unplugged this thing, and it currently is at rest in a Caroline County dumpster.\nNow, here are the recipes.\nCHICAGO STYLE HOT DOG\n4 hot dog buns, 3 tbsps melted butter, 1 tbsp poppy seeds, 4 hot dogs, 1 tbsp yellow mustard, 1/4 cup pickle relish, 1/4 white onion (finely chopped), 1 tomato (sliced into half moons), 4 pickle spears, 8 sport peppers, 1/2 tsp celery salt.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Brush outside of hot dog buns with butter and sprinkle poppy seeds on top. Place buns, seam side down, on a baking sheet. Bake until lightly toasted and poppy seeds stick to the bun, about 10 minutes. In a large pot of boiling water, add hot dogs and boil until warmed through. Place hot dogs in buns and then top with mustard, onion, relish, tomato slices, pickle spear, sport peppers and a pinch of celery salt.\nSPIRAL DOGS\n1 wooden skewer, 4 hot dogs, 4 buns.\nHeat grill. Slide a long wooden skewer through the entirety of your hot dog. Place the hot dog on a cutting board and, using a paring knife, cut into the hot dog at a slight angle. Turn the hot dog and continue cutting until you reach the other end. Carefully remove the skewer from the hot dog. Repeat with remaining dogs. Grill for 8 minutes. Add any and all your favorite toppings.\nHAWAIIAN HOT DOGS\n8 King's Hawaiian original sweet hot dog buns, 8 hot dogs split lengthwise (be careful not to cut all the way through). FOR THE PINEAPPLE SALSA: 2 cups fresh pineapple (finely chopped), 1/2 small red onion (finely chopped), 1/2 cup freshly chopped cilantro, 3 tbsps fresh lime juice, kosher salt. FOR THE SPICY MAYO: 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/4 cup Sriracha, 1 tbsp fresh lime juice, kosher salt.\nMake the pineapple salsa: In a small bowl, toss together pineapple, onion, cilantro and lime juice. Season with salt and set aside. Make the spicy mayo: In another small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, Sriracha, and lime juice, if adding. Season with salt and set aside. Heat a grill or grill pan over medium heat. Split King's Hawaiian Original Hawaiian Sweet Hot Dog Buns and toast as desired. Set aside. Place hot dogs on a grill or grill pan and cook for about 3 minutes, or until grill marks appear. Place hot dogs in buns, then top with pineapple salsa, and drizzle with spicy mayo. Garnish with more cilantro before serving.\nEVERYTHING BAGEL DOGS\n2 tbsps poppy seeds, 2 tbsps dried minced onion, 2 tbsps sesame seeds, 2 tsps garlic powder, 1 tsp coarse salt. FOR THE BAGEL HOT DOGS: 1 package puff pastry (thawed), 1 package cream cheese (softened), 1 package hot dogs, 1 1/2 cups water, 2 tbsps baking soda.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Combine all seasonings into a small bowl, stirring until well blended. Set aside. Slice the puff pastry into 1\" strips lengthwise. Spread cream cheese along each strip, then roll around a hot dog, covering it from end to end. Set aside. Microwave water until it starts to steam a little, about 1 minute. Pour into a large bowl, stirring in baking soda until dissolved. Dip each hot dog into the baking soda-water mixture, then place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Liberally sprinkle each hot dog with Everything Bagel seasoning. Bake until the pastry has puffed up and turned a light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.\nOLD FASHIONED LUNCHEON COUNTER DOG\n8 hot dogs (sliced down the middle), 8 buns, 1 onion (chopped or sliced in rings), cooking oil and butter.\nHeat oil in a non-stick pan to medium heat. Prepare fresh buns by opening and buttering them. Add sliced or chopped onions to fry. When browned, remove onions to keep warm, or keep them in the pan pushed to the side. Slice hot dogs down the middle but not all the way through (keep it connected). You want to pry them open to have a double wide face down hot dog. Lay them flat, cut side down in the seasoned pan and cook until brown, Flip to the other side and brown. When browned to your liking, remove from the pan. Keep the pan on medium heat. Put buttered buns face down in the hot pan to toast them (I press them down a couple of times so butter and pan connect). When nice and brown, remove them. Assemble the hot dog and sauteed onions into the bun. Dress with mustard and ketchup and anything else your heart desires! Pour a nice, ice-cold Coke with a straw, add some crinkle fries, and enjoy a trip back in time!\nCHILI DOGS\n1 tbsp olive oil, 1 pound lean ground beef, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, 2 tbsps Dijon mustard, 8 all-beef hot dogs, 8 hot dog buns, grated sharp cheddar cheese, finely chopped red onion.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add the beef, onion powder, garlic powder, kosher salt, and chili powder and cook until the beef is browned, mashing and breaking up any large pieces, about 8 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, ketchup, and mustard and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 10 to 12 minutes to let the flavors meld. Meanwhile, grill the hot dogs. Heat an outdoor grill for direct, medium-high heat. Scrape the grill grates clean as needed. Place the hot dogs on the grill and grill until well-marked and heated through, about 2 minutes per side. Turn the heat off and gently toast the buns on the still-warm grill, about 2 minutes. To serve, place a hot dog in each bun and top with the chili, cheddar cheese, and red onions. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Arms had just arrived back from patrolling with the infantry outside the city for multiple days. On these patrols, you could forget about hot water, phones and internet. There were no \"creature comforts,\" as Detmer put it.\n\"It was a dirty and miserable place,\" he said. \"And that was not considering the danger that was connected to it.\"\nDetmer watched Arms enter the room that day and look toward the large and overflowing plywood trashcan.\n\"That trashcan would get heaped up,\" Detmer said. \"And it would usually take a sergeant or an angry corporal coming in there and fussing at somebody to take it out and put it in the trashcan outside.\"\nDetmer can remember Arms, who had just returned from that \"dirty and miserable\" patrol rotation, setting his things down and going over to take out the trash; Assuming responsibility for something he hadn't contributed to.\n\"Not one piece of that trash in that trashcan came from Brad Arms,\" Detmer said. \"Brad Arms was out in hardship and danger that whole time that trashcan had filled up.\"\nArms, who was later killed while serving in Iraq, was one of the five fallen heroes that Detmer spoke about at a Memorial Day service hosted by American Legion Post 91 in Cambridge on Monday, May 27. Detmer also spoke about two other friends, Andy Aviles and Jesse Strong, and two Dorchester natives, Cecil \"Butch\" Jenkins from Taylors Island and Adam Mooney from Cambridge.\nIn sharing each of their stories, Detmer pointed out the similarities of the five men. They were bright and well-regarded in their communities. \"The cream of the crop,\" he said.\nAlong with that, as illustrated in Detmer's story about Arms, these men were not selfish.\n\"They were also people who I don't believe — even knowing (the) price that they were eventually called to pay — I don't think they would have shirked it,\" he said.\nAt the American Legion on Memorial Day, prayer and song were a part of the service dedicated to those who gave their lives serving in the military. Former state senator and Post 91 Historian Richard Colburn told attendees they could \"certainly\" grill hotdogs and crack open a beer in the afternoon.\n\"But to honor those that gave us supreme sacrifice is the most important thing we can do on Memorial Day,\" he said.\nAt the service, Dorchester County Orphans Court Judge Rev. George Ames gave an invocation, the City of Cambridge Color Guard presented arms, Amy Bennett sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and \"God Bless America,\" Sheila Hickman read the poem \"In Flanders Fields,\" Cole Kesselring played the bagpipes and Pastor Steve Bloodsworth gave a benediction.\nAt noon, the firing of a cannon indicated the American flag had been raised from half-mast, in honor of Memorial Day, and \"Taps\" was played.\nIn his speech, Detmer said that it is important to honor and memorialize fallen heroes through holding these events, creating physical monuments dedicated to them and telling their stories.\n\"Understand that these sons and daughters of these families, they were our friends and neighbors too,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Fun on a bun: hamburgers for summer days\n\n June 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1337\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last week we explored hotdogs, so I decided we could not leave out burgers since both are extremely popular year-round but even more so in the summer.There is just no better smell going through the neighborhood than the smells of burgers on a grill.\nMr. Fletcher Davis of Athens, Texas made some of the first burgers in his small cafe, and the customers went wild over this great sandwich. It was in the 1880s, and the popularity of the burger grew so much that Davis carried the \"burger\" to share with the world at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.\nThere is nothing else to say except get out your grill or your iron fry pan or whatever you use to cook burgers and try some of today's recipes.\nWhenever I hear the word burgers, I immediately start dicing onions, slicing tomatoes, washing lettuce, making sure I have cheese and fresh mustard, ketchup and relish — don't forget the soft buns. Enjoy.\nCLASSIC CHEESEBURGER1 pound ground chuck (80% lean), 1 pound ground sirloin, sea salt, freshly cracked black pepper, 4 or 8 brioche burger buns, 1/3 cup yellow mustard, 1 tbsp butter, 8 slices American cheese, 4 to 8 (1/4-inch-thick) tomato slices, 4 to 8 (1/4-inch-thick) red onion slices, 8 pickle slices, 8 burger-size lettuce leaves.\nIn a large bowl, combine the ground chuck and sirloin and mix gently but thoroughly. Divide into eight equal portions and shape them into burger patties. Season both sides with salt and pepper and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Split and toast the buns in the pan until toasty and golden brown. Set aside. Remove the burgers from the fridge and place a thumbprint in the center of each patty.\nSmear 1 tsp of the mustard on both sides of each patty. Melt the butter in the preheated pan and, working in batches, fry the burgers for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until a dark brown crust begins to form. The result: perfectly juicy medium-cooked burgers. For folks who prefer their burgers a little more well done, fry for 5 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer the patties to a baking sheet as they're done. Top each with cheese and place in the oven to melt, 2 to 3 minutes. Build the burgers on the toasted buns with 1 or 2 burger patties, a slice of tomato, pickles, a slice of red onion and lettuce. Top each with ketchup or mayo. Serve immediately.\nCHEDDAR AND ONION SMASH BURGER16 thin bread-and-butter or dill pickle slices (patted dry), four 4-inch potato buns (buttered and toasted), 1 1/4 pounds ground beef chuck, salt and freshly ground pepper, 2 small onions (sliced paper thin), 4 ounces sharp cheddar cheese (sliced).\nHeat a cast-iron griddle until very hot. Layer the pickle slices on the bottom buns. Without overworking the meat, loosely form it into four balls and place them on the griddle. Cook the meatballs over moderately high heat for 30 seconds. Using a sturdy large spatula, flatten each ball into a 5-inch round patty. Season the patties with salt and pepper and cook for 2 minutes, until well seared. Press a handful of sliced onions onto each patty. Using the spatula, carefully flip each burger so the onions are on the bottom. Top with the cheese and cook for 2 minutes. Cover with a roasting pan and cook just until the cheese is melted, 1 minute more. Transfer the burgers with the onions to the buns and add any additional toppings you like.\nTEXAS BURGERSColeslaw: 3/4 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 small onion (finely shredded), 3 tbsps cider vinegar, 2 tbsps sugar, 2 tsps celery seeds, 8 cups shredded green cabbage ,1 large carrot (finely shredded), salt and freshly ground pepper. Burgers: 2 pounds ground beef chuck, vegetable oil for rubbing, salt and freshly ground pepper, 3/4 cup barbecue sauce, 4 hamburger buns (split), sliced pickles.\nIn a large bowl, whisk the mayonnaise with the onion, vinegar, sugar and celery seeds. Add the shredded cabbage and carrot, season with salt and pepper and toss well. Let stand until slightly softened, about 25 minutes. Light a grill. Form the beef into four patties; rub with oil and season with salt and pepper. Sear over high heat, turning once, for 5 minutes for medium-rare. Brush with 1/2 cup of the barbecue sauce and grill until glazed, about 1 minute per side. Grill the buns and brush them with the remaining barbecue sauce. Top with the burgers, pickles and coleslaw and serve.\nBLACK BEAN BURGERS1/4 cup dried bread crumbs, 1/4 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp ground coriander, 3 cups cooked black beans, 1/4 cup light mayonnaise, salt, pepper, 2 large stalks celery, 1 chipotle chile in adobo, 4 green-leaf lettuce leaves, 4 whole wheat hamburger buns, 4 slices of a ripe tomato.\nIn a food processor with a knife blade attached, pulse bread crumbs, cumin, coriander, two-thirds of beans, 2 tbsps mayonnaise, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper until well blended. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in celery and remaining whole beans until well combined. Divide into 4 portions and shape into patties. Lightly coat a 12-inch nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Heat on medium 1 minute, then add patties. Cook 10 to 12 minutes or until browned on both sides, carefully turning once. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine chipotle chile and remaining 2 tbsps mayonnaise until well mixed. Place 1 lettuce leaf on bottom of each bun; top with patty, then tomato slice. Divide chipotle mayonnaise among burgers and replace tops of buns to serve.\nBACON AND CHEESE FILLED BURGER3 tbsps dark brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp chipotle powder, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp fresh-ground pepper, 1 pound ground beef, 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 6 slices bacon (cooked and crumbled), 4 rolls.\nHeat grill to medium. Combine the sugar, spices, salt and pepper in a small bowl and set aside. Form the beef into 8 equal patties. Toss the cheese and crumbled bacon together and place an equal amount on four of the patties. Place the remaining patties over the cheese and bacon and pinch the edges to seal. Generously pat each burger with the reserved spice mixture. Grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium.\nSHANNON'S JALAPENO BURGERSThis last burger recipe is my daughter in law Shannon's creations. Shannon assured me the secret here is that you grill this on charcoal, not gas. The smoke helps bring out the flavor in this next burger.\n3 pounds grass-fed ground beef (preferably 80/20 or 85/15), 4 jalapeno peppers (diced), 4 garlic cloves (minced), 1 onion (diced), 8 slices of pepper jack or ghost pepper cheese, a pack of buns of your choice.\nPrepare the grill for cooking on high heat. I let the coals get gray and orange from the heat. Mix jalapeno pepper, garlic, onion and ground beef in a bowl. Separate beef mixture into about seven equal bundles. Place a thick slice of pepper jack cheese into the center of each beef bundle (about the size of a thick butter pat). Form bundles into patties. Brush grill grate with oil. Grill hamburger patties 5 minutes per side.\nWhen you place the patties on the grill, the juices will cause the fire to flame up, try to watch it so they don't burn. Move the patties around for direct and indirect heat patterns if you must. I like mine medium rare so around 5 minutes is perfect. At this point, you can add the cheese to the burgers while they are still grilling, but you must really watch to make sure the burgers don't burn or remove burgers from the grill and top with pepper jack cheese. You can take your buns, split them, and smear butter olive oil on each side. Place them face down on another part of the grill for maybe 30 seconds to get a food toasting. Serve with condiments of your choice. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: The greatest of all time\n\n June 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Doug Morley Bethel Wesleyan Church | Section: News \n \n 491\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n What do Tom Brady, Caitlin Clark, Muhammad Ali and John the Baptist have in common? They have all held the title \"Greatest of All Time.\"In Matthew 11:11, Jesus makes it quite clear that \"among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist.\" Now you must be rather great to be considered a G.O.A.T. by Jesus.\nWhat was it about John that made him the greatest of all time? It was John's God-given calling to prepare the way for Jesus' coming. When the Archangel Gabriel announced to Zechariah that he and his wife Elizabeth would have a son in their old age, he said this about John:\n\"He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord\" (Luke 1:16-17).\nJohn was the forerunner of Christ. He was the one chosen by God to prepare the hearts of people for the coming of their Messiah. Upon his birth, Zechariah praised God as he blessed John saying, \"And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him, to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins\" (Luke 1:76-77).\nJohn did his job well. When Jesus came upon the scene, he pointed to Him and said, \"look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). From that moment on Jesus' ministry increased while John's ministry decreased. He had fulfilled his calling.\nThat's why Jesus is considered the G.O.A.T.\nBut then Jesus makes this observation, \"yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he\" (Matthew 11:11b). In other words, you and I have the potential of being the Greater of All Time in our generation.\nLike John, we are forerunners of Christ, preparing the hearts of people to receive the salvation of God through the forgiveness of their sins. We have the God-given calling to prepare the way for our Lord and Savior to come into the hearts and lives of our friends and family and those within our sphere of influence.\nMay God help us fulfill our calling as His witnesses in this world. May His Spirit work in and through us to prepare the way for others to come to know Jesus as their Savior and Lord.\nMay we be about the business of making disciples who make disciples until the day we hear Jesus say, \"well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness\" (Matthew 25:21). May we be G.O.A.T.s in the eyes of our Lord. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Jack Patterson at Hopewell United Methodist Church in Port Deposit and got married.\n\"My father was strict,\" Joan recalled. \"I wasn't allowed past the sidewalk after 8 p.m.\"\nSo the young couple eloped June 14, 1954. They had been dating about a year.\n\"I met him through his cousin,\" Joan said. \"I think we clicked right away.\" Dating meant driving around, talking and going out to dinner.\n\"We'd go to the one (restaurant) in North East and one in Chesapeake City,\" Wayne recalled.\n\"The one in North East you could sit and watch them cook through the window,\" Joan added.\nThen came 'The Day.'\n\"I proposed to him,\" Joan said. It was one of several days she had ditched school to hang out with Wayne.\n\"I was just being silly. I asked if he'd marry me. He said, 'yeah,'\" Joan said, adding, \"I wasn't expecting that.\"\nFor the wedding, Joan wore a dress from her own closet.\n\"I snuck off wearing a dress I already had,\" she said. \"It was a purple dress with a black bolero and black suede shoes.\"\nShe also wore a white corsage; a gift from Wayne.\nWayne wore his uniform. He was in the US Air Force from 1953 to 1957. Trained as an aircraft mechanic during the Korean War, he spent 15 months in the Philippines and also served in the Formosa Islands, among other stops.\n\"It was good to see what other people lived like,\" Wayne said of his service years. \"They didn't like the U.S. and they still don't.\"\nAfter a short honeymoon in the Poconos, the couple lived with her cousins — Gert and Frankie Bines — for a time before buying their first home.\n\"We found a little house on Richmond Street (in Perryville) for $4,000,\" Wayne said. \"When we had that house we used to have all the kids over with big dinners.\"\nThose five kids led to 12 grandchildren and now 26 great grandchildren. Big family dinners are a thing of the past.\nExcept for the house Wayne built in Port Deposit near Burlin Road, the couple has always lived in Perryville.\nFrom Port Deposit, they moved into Joan's parents' house for 43 years, then into a smaller rancher about 15 years ago.\n\"This has everything on one floor,\" Joan noted.\nThe secret of their success\nAccording to the American Psychological Association, more than 30% of first marriages end in divorce.\nSo how have the Smythes made it to 70 years?\n\"No arguments over money,\" Wayne said simply. \"Money is what breaks a lot of people up. I brought home all the paychecks to her.\"\n\"With a large item to buy, we'd discuss it,\" he added.\nJoan worked until she had their first child, Joanne, when she was 18. After Wayne Jr, Douglas, Michelle and Jennifer were old enough, she went back to work while Wayne worked as many as four jobs. That included his own oil burner service company.\n\"I raised a bunch of kids. He worked all the time,\" she said. \"It has paid off.\"\nHe did have some fun in between all those working hours.\n\"He bought an old bakery truck and turned it into a camper,\" Joan said, remembering all those fun trips as a family.\n\"I used to have classic cars,\" Wayne added. The one he admits to missing the most is a 1962 Chevrolet Corvette. \"I also had a Ford Coupe, a Mercury and a Thunderbird.\"\nNow as they approach their Platinum Anniversary, Wayne looked back and commented he was \"just a plain country boy\" when he and Joan got married, and they have had a good marriage.\n\"I have no regrets in my life,\" Wayne said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One of the blessings of having a personally relationship with our Lord is that when He comes into our lives He is there to help us with our everyday cares, responsibilities and concerns.The apostle Paul writing to believers at Corinth wrote in 2 Corinthians 1 \"Blessed be God who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble.\"\nIt seems like all of us deal with troubles and at times more troubles than others. It is vital that we be not discouraged by the things that we face.\nToday I would like to offer some practical reminders to overcome strife in your life, your family, your workplace or your service unto God.\nFirst make sure you are trusting in the Lord. 2 Cor 1:3 \"Bless be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Mercies.\"\nLet Him be your help. Please make sure you know the Lord personally. He is the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort.\nI gave my life to the Lord over 50 years ago and have not regretted it a single day. God is so good.\nSecondly remember the comfort and blessings of the past. V. 4 \"Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble.\"\nSince He has helped us in the past, he can do the same in the present. It is always good to count our past blessings.\nThirdly, since so many of us have been helped by the Lord let us let God work through us to bless others. Be the hands and feet of our Lord.\nFinally, it is always wise recall the promises of God.\nPaul wrote in Philippians 4:13, \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthenes me.\"\nDon Reynolds is the pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in Denton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Marray under The Episcopal Church's Title IV canons.According to The Episcopal Church's website, both complaints allege Marray made inappropriate public statements and misrepresentations. The Episcopal Church's Title IV canons sets standards of conduct for ordained people in the church as well as provides a process for addressing misconduct allegations.\nIn a June 18 statement, the Standing Committee of the Diocese of Easton said that it, along with the Diocesan Council, the complainants and Marray, have been kept aware of the proceedings.\nAccording to the church's website, the first complaint, made by multiple complainants, was provided to an intake officer in July 2023. In January, an intake report was forwarded to a reference panel. In February, the vice president of House of Bishops, the Rev. Mary Gray-Reeves, took on the role of presiding bishop, and on May 2, a reference panel referred the matter for conciliation, which entails a third party facilitates a conversation between the complainants and respondent.\nThe second complaint, made by a single complainant, was forwarded to an intake officer in February, according to the church's website. In March, an intake report was forwarded to a reference panel. On May 2, a reference panel referred three of the five claims made for conciliation, and it said the remaining two claims did not require action other than \"appropriate pastoral response.\"\nThe Standing Committee of the Diocese of Easton said in its statement that this information was posted on the church's website on May 30. It said Gray-Reeves has advised Marray of the reference panel's referrals, and Marray has been cooperating with the Title IV process, which includes refraining from discussing the situation.\n\"We ask for the church's continued prayers for all involved in these two complaints as we move forward seeking reconciliation, healing and a renewed commitment to ensuring our churches are safe and welcoming places where all are treated with dignity and respect,\" the statement said.\nThe Episcopal Diocese of Easton did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "PAstoral Ponderings: Turn to Proverbs in times of uncertainty\n\n June 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: THE REV. DANIEL T. GEDMAN St. Luke’s G.M.C. Denton | Section: Columns \n \n 266\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Some time ago, I had written about the book of Psalms and how it is an extraordinary series of blessings given by God that exhibits a remarkable timelessness spanning millenniums. Its constituent prayers and songs have provided inspiration, peace, tranquility and wonder for as long as they have existed.Today, I'd like to reflect upon the book of Proverbs. This book is oft believed to be the most practical book in the Bible that contains collections, axioms and discourses about how to live wisely.\nUltimately, the book provides a means for defining both wise and foolish behaviors and provides evidence for us to consider both the positive and negative consequences of such wise and foolish behaviors. There is no area in life that the Proverbs does not address. It is a complete text of God's wisdom given to us to learn and grow.\nIn the times in which we find ourselves overwhelmed by life's experiences and are uncertain of what to do next, turn to Proverbs. Chapter 1:2-3 states that this text is, \"for gaining wisdom and instruction; for understanding words of insight; for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair.\"\nWhile Psalms open our minds, hearts and mouths with just the words we need to find both joy and relief, Proverbs provides us with wonder of God's wisdom that helps us to order our lives as God desires for us.\nAnd so, in times when you may be uncertain what to do, seek God's wisdom in Proverbs. You will find an amazing and joyful wealth of wisdom that only God himself can provide. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She would begin to pull down boxes and cans, then out came the pots, pans and utensils to begin the meal.My mom was frugal — not wasting any ingredients but still whipping up a filling and tasty meal.\nWith today's outrageous prices for food products, we need to revert back to the '50s and '60s recipes with a slight remake to your family's likes and tastes.\nWalking down the grocery aisle, I look and compare prices from the previous week, and I shudder. Some items I place back on the shelf and move on.\nI think about families with children who must rearrange eating habits to fit the budget. My mind goes back to Bishopville where mom fed 11 children, two adults and sometimes two elderly stepparents. Then I remember back to my kitchen in the late '60s as a widowed mother of three.\nMeal planning was done before walking in the store with a mental cash register adding as you shopped.\nI am going to continue on with some recipes from years gone by, but ones that \"still feed the family and fill the tummy.\"\nCHEESEBURGER PIE\n1 lb. ground beef, 1 cup diced onion, ½ tsp salt, 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, ¼ cup ketchup, 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, ¾ cup Bisquick baking mix, 1 cup milk, 2 eggs.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease a 9-inch pie plate (or a deep 8-inch square baking dish); set aside. In a large skillet, brown ground beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink (about 8-10 minutes). Drain off fat. Stir in salt, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup and cheese. Transfer beef mixture to the prepared pie dish. In a separate bowl, whisk together Bisquick, milk and eggs, just until combined (it's fine if you still have some lumps in the batter — do not overmix).Pour batter on top of beef. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.\nFRIED GREEN TOMATOES\n3 medium-sized firm green tomatoes, salt, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tbsp cajun seasoning (optional), 1/2 cup milk or buttermilk, 1 large egg, 1/3 cup fine white cornmeal, 1/2 cup fine dry breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup oil for frying.\nCut unpeeled tomatoes into 1/2 inch slices. Sprinkle slices with salt. Let tomato slices stand for 5 minutes. While the salted green tomato slices are resting, place in three separate, shallow bowls: 1) the flour and cajun seasoning (if using), 2) buttermilk and egg, and 3) breadcrumbs and cornmeal. Whisk together the egg and buttermilk. Heat the oil in a skillet on medium heat. Dip the green tomato slices in the flour-seasoning, then the buttermilk-egg mixture, then the cornmeal-breadcrumb mix. In the skillet, fry half of the coated tomato slices at a time, for 3 to 5 minutes on each side or until brown. Set the cooked tomatoes on paper towels to drain. These fried green tomatoes are fantastic with a little hot sauce if you don't use the cajun seasoning.\nTUNA NOODLE CASSEROLE\n1 lb egg noodles, 4 (5-oz) cans tuna (drained well), 1 (10-oz) bag frozen peas, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup milk, ½ cup panko breadcrumbs, 2 tbsps butter (melted), 1 tsp dried parsley, salt and pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a 9-by-13 baking dish. Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain well. Combine noodles, tuna, soup, milk, peas, salt and pepper. Mix well. Transfer to a baking dish. In a small dish combine melted butter and breadcrumbs. Sprinkle over top. Sprinkle with parsley. Bake for 25-30 minutes until lightly browned and heated through.\nSWEDISH MEATBALLS\n1 (10.75 oz) can cream of mushroom soup (low sodium), 1 (14 oz) can beef broth (low sodium), 1 packet dry onion soup mix, 2 tbsps A1 steak sauce, 2 pound bag frozen meatballs, 1 cup container sour cream, 1 (16 oz) package egg noodles.\nIn a 5 or 6 quart slow cooker, mix cream of mushroom soup with beef broth, onion soup mix and steak sauce. Whisk together well. Then add in frozen meatballs. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high 3 to 5 hours. Just before the meatballs are done, put a pot of water on the oven to boil for your egg noodles (make according to package directions.) Drain noodles well when done. After the meatballs have finished cooking, stir in sour cream. Mix noodles and meatballs together or serve meatballs on top of noodles.\nGOULASH\n1 lb. elbow macaroni (cooked and drained), 1 lb. ground beef, 1 small onion (chopped), 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 (26 oz.) jar spaghetti sauce, 1 tbsp dried parsley (extra for garnish), salt and pepper to taste, grated parmesan cheese.\nIn a large skillet, brown ground beef and onion until no longer pink. Drain if necessary. Reduce heat, season with garlic powder, salt and pepper. When macaroni is cooked, add to the meat mixture. Add spaghetti sauce. Stir to combine. Sprinkle with parsley and stir. Cook on low for 10-15 minutes to allow flavors to combine and thicken slightly. Serve with extra parsley and parmesan cheese.\nWACKY CAKE\n1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup white sugar, 4 tbsps unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking soda, ½ tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tbsp cider vinegar, 6 tbsps vegetable oil, 1 cup water.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Sift flour, sugar, salt, soda and cocoa together into an 8-by-8-inch ungreased cake pan. Make three depressions. Pour oil into one well, vinegar into second, and vanilla into third well. Pour water overall, and stir well with a fork. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Frost with your favorite icing.\nORIGINAL PARTY MIX\n1/2 cup butter or margarine, 2 tbsps Worcestershire sauce, 1 1/4 tsp seasoned salt, 1/4 tsp garlic salt, 3 cups Wheat Chex square cereal, 2 cups Rice Chex square cereal, 1 1/2 cups nuts (such as peanuts, pecans, or cashews), 1 1/2 cups small pretzel rods.\nGather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. Melt the margarine or butter in a shallow pan over low heat. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt and garlic salt. Combine the Wheat Chex, Rice Chex, nuts and pretzel rods in a large bowl and drizzle with half of the butter mixture. Carefully mix with a wooden spoon to avoid breaking the pretzels and cereal squares. Repeat with the remaining butter mixture, evenly coating all the pieces. Place the mix in a shallow baking pan with sides. Bake for 25 to 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes to evenly toast the mixture. Cool for at least 15 minutes and enjoy.\nSHIRLEY TEMPLE\nPour 1 ounce grenadine over ice in a glass. Top with 4 ounces Sprite or 7UP soda and 4 ounces ginger ale. Stir gently to combine. Garnish with a maraschino cherry and enjoy. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

She is good. We are bringing in Anita from Gary, Indiana then she will travel to Dallas and work with Sharon. She needs more than her three instructors. And she needs to practice three to six hours a day.\"My parents, standing in their living room, just stared at the one instructor telling them what to do. She then pointed to a wall with wallpaper on it.\n\"This wall would be perfect for a wall mirror.\"\nMy mother instantly replied, \"That is not going to happen. I use this room for my bridge club.\"\nThus, my father trotted off to an Ethan Allen store, and for my 15th birthday in 1972, he gave me a large mirror that sat on a big wooden stand.\nI sweated my rear off in front of that mirror for years and, yes, practiced more than three hours each day.\nMy father moved that mirror nine times, including to my college housing in Cumberland, Maryland. Cursing the mirror as he climbed three flights of steps of a row house on an extremely sweltering day, a woman peeped out of her own rowhouse window, recognizing my father. \"Is that Willie Passmore the\njockey?\" she inquired.\nI replied, \"Yes, he is my father, and I am renting the top floor bedroom.\"\nShe said, \"My golly, I remember him riding racehorses in the 1950s at the Cumberland racetrack.\"\nI walked up the stairs, saw that my father was still gently cursing the mirror and said, \"Dad, there is a woman outside who recognizes you.\"\n\"A woman?\" he asked.\nWith that, my flirtatious father erased the bad memories of moving me and the heavy mirror into my new abode.\nI thought it would be an easy exchange to bring the piece back into the family realm even though it was in my former marital home, now my ex-husband's home, for my daughter's use until she purchased her own home.\nMy ex-husband resisted.\nOn Monday, July 1, a Maryland judge reminded him that anything brought into the marriage, prior to the marriage, is not a marital asset, especially a family gift or heirloom. Thus, the mirror was returned to me.\nIt is nice to have the memories and the mirror back in my home. Good to reflect on my dad again.\nCATHY LINDBERG JAROSZ\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: How are you living?\n\n July 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KEVIN RANDOLPH Greensboro Baptist Church | Section: Columns \n \n 462\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Just about every day of our lives, we are either asked or we ask someone the following question: \"How are you doing?\"Most of the time the response is \"fine,\" or \"good\" or even \"blessed.\" So the answer to this question is typically based on how we are responding to what is going on in life, how the situations of life are being handled.\nIf the word \"doing\" is changed to \"living,\" the question is now about how we approach life, not just respond to it.\nThis focuses more on our purpose and motives in what we do every day. It focuses on what our goals and plans are and how we are going to accomplish them. It is more about the living, and not just responding to life's challenges.\nIn 1 Peter 4:7-11, the Apostle Peter wrote about living in light of eternity. He emphasizes \"living life\" and not just responding to life.\nIn these verses, Peter reminds Christians that we should be living in light of eternity. Motives for how to live, goals for what to do in life, should be weighed in view of eternity. Peter tells us four key things in these verses to do in order to live in light of eternity.\nFirst, he says to have a focused prayer life. In order to do that, verse 7 says to be \"serious\" and \"watchful.\" The Christian's mind must be focused on what is right as well as exercising self-control in how they live. These two things are essential to a focused prayer life.\nSecondly, he says to love others deeply in verse 8. God loves us deeply. That is why he sent Jesus to die on the cross for our sins. Allowing God's love to flow through our lives to others is essential for living in light of eternity.\nThird, in verse 9, he says to be hospitable without complaining. Showing hospitality with joy will touch other people's lives and it will impact the giver's life as well. A little hospitality goes a long way in building meaningful relationships with people.\nThe last thing he says about a person who lives in light of eternity is that they use their talents to bring honor and glory to God in verses 10 and 11. God is the One that blesses each person with their talents and abilities. It only seems natural to make sure that the One who gives the talents is also the One who receives the glory for how the talents/abilities are used to help others.\nIn light of eternity, how are you living today? I want to encourage you that you can live in light of eternity — to love and help others, to glorify and honor God. Living this way is a blessed life. So live well, and live in light of eternity. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Pastor tries to foster family feel at First Baptist Church of Cambridge\n\n July 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 615\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — When it comes to church membership, First Baptist Church of Cambridge Pastor Chris Colbert would rather have 10 \"sincere God lovers\" than 10,000 \"nominal pew sitters.\"Since coming to Cambridge from Monmouth County, New Jersey in September 2022, Colbert has aimed to \"cultivate sincere and mature followers of God.\"\n\"So we're creating a community of intimate, committed, loving, sacrificial family members who want to help each other to that goal: To know and love God. To renew our minds in the whole word of God in an environment of community-wide, intergenerational, mutual discipleship,\" he said.\nFor Colbert, this goal is first and foremost. And although he sees the church's growth as something that is up to God, it is clear that membership has changed since Colbert's arrival. When Colbert arrived in Cambridge, there were no children at First Baptist Church of Cambridge, he said.\n\"We're small, but we have several families with multiple kids, he said about the church today. \"We have multiple generations, and we're diverse.\"\nCongregant Steve Merrick, who has been a member for 10 years, said said there are now more children at the church than there were 10 years ago.\nMerrick, who was on the committee that nominated Colbert to be pastor of the church, describes Colbert — along with his wife, Danielle, and their three children — as God-centered, energetic, knowledgeable, sincere and loving. He said that since Colbert's arrival, he has noticed more sincerity, compassion and love among the congregation.\n\"I believe it's (Colbert) and his nature,\" Merrick said about the reason for this increase.\nColbert said he is excited about the \"healthy, sincere\" group of congregants at the church.\n\"Everybody — as (much) as they possibly can — they participate in everything,\" he said. \"So we're little, but it's a family.\"\nThroughout the week, the church hosts study sessions, meals and services. On Wednesday at 6 p.m., there is a study and prayer. Every other Friday, a Homeschool Hikers group gets homeschool families outside and exploring. On Sunday mornings, church-goers can attend an adult Sunday school before the 10:30 a.m. service. And on the first Sunday of the month, the church hosts a potluck after its service.\nColbert hasn't always been a pastor. He said it wasn't until three years ago that he was called to ministry. At that time, he was an audit manager in Manhattan.\nOn his commute from New Jersey to Manhattan, Colbert would \"binge\" listen to Pastor John Piper's Romans sermon series. And although Colbert had always been passionate about consuming theology, he said the series caused him to experience a shift.\n\"It really struck me,\" he said. \"And for the first time, I had a very deep and sustainable affection for God that I have not ever had. And I became very passionate then about sharing that.\"\nWhen it came time to make a decision on where to serve, Colbert said one of the major factors for choosing Cambridge was need.\n\"We believe that there was tremendous need here,\" he said. \"It was a much older church. It was a small church. ... There were no children. And a church is just, practically in God's providence, not sustainable if you don't have every generation.\"\nColbert's wife Danielle, who he calls Dee, remembers crossing the Frederick C. Malkus Bridge toward Trappe after visiting Cambridge for Colbert's final meeting as a candidate. It was raining.\n\"Like it was hard to see,\" Colbert said.\nAs they drove over the bridge, a \"full\" and \"gorgeous\" rainbow became visible.\n\"We're not superstitious,\" Colbert said. \"But we do believe God sovereignly speaks and works through all things. ... We thought it (was) like a nice little bow on our experience here.\"\nTo learn more about First Baptist Church of Cambridge, visit https://www.fbccmd.com/ or call (410) 228-4943. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: Live at peace with everyone?\n\n July 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PETER SMITH | Section: Columns \n \n 338\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the shadow of the attempted assassination of former President Trump last week, President Biden challenged both political parties to calm things down in the race, to be more civil with those who have differing political opinions and views.Many must have thought, \"What an impossible request!\" What do you think?\nThe Apostle Paul challenged Christians living in Rome in a similar way. He said, \"If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.\" (Romans 12:18). Paul, did you really mean everyone? Does everyone include my enemies, crazy people at work, an ex-spouse or even a former convict? Are their parameters to follow? Guidelines?\nIt comes down to valuing others through the lens of love. If we claim to have faith in Jesus, then His love in us must respond through us in every situation.\nI'm learning by watching others who do this well. They say, \"I've learned to swallow my pride.\" Another told me he doesn't always try to get the last word in when he disagrees with someone else. Seems practical. And Paul did say \"if it's possible…\" which means sometimes we won't be able to live peacefully with others. But for sure, it comes down to me, to you, not the \"other\" person. Again his words: \"as far as it depends on you…\"\nWill there be exceptions? Of course. When face to face with evil, we must deal with it and not cave in. But pastorally I've seen people use exceptions as their rule for living and dealing with others all the time. My prayer is that we learn to take the high road as much as possible when tough situations come our way.\nPaul's challenge is to dig deep into our character, into our faith, when confronted with people who are not peace oriented at times. I pray God will help us discover ways to agree to disagree when we don't get along with others. Though it might be a difficult challenge, God says it's possible to do. May we believe it is too. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Canning day in the kitchen\n\n July 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 1630\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The fresh vegetables were picked, washed and ready to be processed for \"canning day\" on the farm.Canning day was decided by the ripeness of the vegetables. Let me tell you, canning involves a lot of work.\nOutside in the storage building were baskets full of empty jars that were washed and stored during the year as the contents were eaten. In an empty \"lard can\" were the rings off the jars and boxes of new caps were waiting to be used in the process of the two-piece jar lids.\nTwo washing tubs were set up outside, one with hot soapy water and the other with clear water for rinsing. The bushel baskets holding the canning jars from the previous year's canning day were carefully carried to the house and placed on the long counter tops in the old-fashioned country kitchen.\nOn top of the kitchen stove would be two heavy-duty kitchen pots filled with vegetables — maybe green beans or lima beans or tomatoes or corn — and as soon as it was blanched, the veggies were placed in the canning jars.\nThe jar lids were put on lightly, and the jars placed in the canning pots. The canning pots started rolling on the fire, thus cooking the vegetables.\nThis scene lasted all day, or until the veggies were all used.\nI must say what a beautiful sight — rows of glass jars with corn, green beans, beets, relishes, jellies, jams and so much more.\nBut thank you, technology, for the pressure cooker, food processor, microwave, portable oven and more.\nCANNED PEACHES4 lbs. peaches (about 9 large peaches), 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, 8 cups water.\nbring a large pot of water to a boil. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Using a paring knife, cut a shallow \"x\" into the bottom of each peach. Add peaches to boiling water and let boil for 3 minutes. Remove peaches and place directly in a bowl of ice water. When peaches are cool enough to handle, peel peaches. Slice peaches and discard the pit. Divide peaches between 4 sterilized canning jars, being sure to leave about 1 inch of space from the top of the jar. In another medium pot over medium heat, add sugar and 8 cups water and bring to a simmer. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Pour simple syrup over peaches, leaving about 1/4 inch of space from the top of the jar. Gently tap jars on the counter to settle peaches and syrup. Add more syrup as necessary to each jar. Tightly seal jars with lids. Fill a large stock pot about halfway with water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Once water is close to a simmer, use tongs to carefully lower jars into hot water. Let water come to a gentle boil and boil for 25 minutes. Carefully remove jars from the stock pot and let sit at room temperature until completely cool. Press down on the lid of the jars to test if they are properly sealed. If the lid bounces back or pops the jar is not sealed. Once jars are properly sealed and cooled, store in a dry dark space until ready to eat.\nPICKLED BEETS4 to 5 lbs small beets, 2 tsps pickling salt, 1 1/2 cups white sugar, 3 cups white vinegar, 2 tbsps mixed pickling spice tied in cheesecloth bag, 1 cup water.\nWash the beets and remove most of the tops, leaving about 1/2 inch of beet top remaining. In a large boiling pot of water, cook the beets until barely tender. Remove from the stove. Submerge the beets in a large bowl of ice water. Cut off the tops and the roots completely, then remove the skin. Peel and slice beets into preferred size. Combine the vinegar, sugar, water, salt and pickling spice in a nonreactive pot and bring mixture to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the beets to the pickling liquid and return to a boil. Remove the spice bag. Carefully ladle the beets and pickling liquid into hot sterilized pint jars, leaving 1/2 inch headspace. Remove any air bubbles with a non-metal utensil. Add additional pickling liquid, if needed, to keep the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims thoroughly with a clean damp cloth, failure to do this can result in the jars not sealing properly. Seal the jars and process for 35 minutes in a boiling water bath.\nHOMEMADE PICKLE RELISH2½ lbs cucumbers (peeled, center row of seeds removed and finely diced), 1 large yellow onion (finely diced), 1 small red bell pepper (finely diced), 1 small green bell pepper (finely diced), 3 cloves garlic (finely minced), ¼ cup kosher or pickling salt, 3 cups white vinegar, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 tsps dill seeds, 1 tbsp yellow mustard seeds, 2 tsps celery seeds, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 2 bay leaves.\nPlace the diced cucumbers, onion, bell pepper and garlic in a large mixing bowl. Combine with the salt and pour water over the mixture until covered. Let sit for at least 6 hours or overnight. Drain the cucumber mixture in a colander, rinse thoroughly with water, and drain again. In a large stock pot, add the sugar, vinegar, and spices and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the drained cucumber mixture and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. Ladle the hot relish into hot sterile jars, leaving ¼ inch of headspace. Wipe the rims of the jars clean and seal tightly with the lids. Process the jars in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. Sealed jars will store in a cool, dark place for a year. If the seal is broken, the relish will keep in the fridge for at least a month. Makes 4 pints. Best eaten at least a week later after the flavors have had time to meld and the vinegar mellows out a bit.\nSTRAWBERRY JAM5 cups crushed fresh strawberries, 4 16-oz. containers, 7 cups granulated sugar, 1 packet original Sure-Jell premium fruit pectin powder, 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 tsp butter.\nWash jars, lids and bands in hot soapy water, dry completely, and set bands aside. Simmer lids in warm water in a saucepan until ready to place them on jars. Keep jars warm by simmering in hot water until ready to use. Do not boil. Fill a 20 quart stock pot or water bath canner with hot water, and place on the stove over medium-high heat. You'll need enough water to later cover your jars with at least 1 inch of water. Crush strawberries in a large mixing bowl or shallow glass baking dish using hand masher until nice, smooth consistency. Transfer crushed strawberries to 8-quart stock pot. Add pectin, lemon juice and butter to the pot, and stir constantly with a wooden spoon over high heat while bringing to a rolling boil. Once boiling, add sugar, return to rolling boil, then boil for 1 minute while stirring constantly. After 1 minute, remove foam from top of jam by skimming it off with a metal spoon.one by one, remove a jar from hot water, transfer to a cookie sheet, place regular mouth canning funnel on jar, and ladle in strawberry jam mixture leaving 1/4 inch empty head space at top of the jar. Then wipe off the rim of the lid and threads of the jar with damp cloth.\nContinue until all jars have been filled. Remove warm lids from the saucepan and place one lid on each jar. Then screw one band on each jar just until snug but not overly tight. Place filled jars on a rack in a 20-quart stock pot or water bath canner, then lower down into hot water. Make sure there is enough water in the pot that there is at least 1 inch of water above the jars. Place the lid on your pot and bring to a gentle boil. Once water is boiling, set your timer for processing and boil for 10 minutes, once jars have finished boiling, turn off heat, remove the lid from the pot and let jars sit for 5 minutes before removing. After 5 minutes, lift up the rack to an elevated resting position, then carefully remove jars one by one using a jar lifter, and transfer to a folded towel to cool. The lids on the jars will begin to 'pop' into the sealed position, signifying the jam has been preserved. If any lids do not pop within the first 12-24 hours, transfer those to the refrigerator and use those up first. It may take up to 24-48 hours to finish setting. Jars can be stored in your pantry, or a cool, dry cupboard for up to 1 year.\nHOMEMADE SALSA10 cups peeled, chopped and drained tomatoes; 3 cups chopped onion, ¾ cups chopped green bell pepper, 5 jalapenos (finely chopped, membranes and seeds removed), 7 cloves garlic (finely minced), 2 ½ tsps ground cumin, 2 ½ tsps coarsely ground black pepper, 2 ½ tbsps canning or pickling salt, ⅓ cup chopped fresh cilantro, ⅓ cup sugar (optional, depending on sweetness of tomatoes), 1 ¼ cups apple cider vinegar, 16 ounces tomato sauce (necessary for safe canning/proper pH), 12 ounces tomato paste (optional if you want a thicker salsa).\nCombine all the ingredients in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring often, Fill sterilized pint-size canning jars within 1/2-inch of the top. Wipe the rim of the jar clean and seal with a lid and ring. Process in a water or steam bath canner for 15 minutes Remove the jars carefully from the water or steam bath and let cool to room temperature. Check to make sure the jars have sealed correctly. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Across the country, they are at capacity and numbers we have never seen.\n\"What works about today is people want to get out and do something fun that they can include their dogs and family,\" Crankshaw-Quimby said. \"It is bringing people who care about their animals all together.\"\nAccording to Crankshaw-Quimby, Laura Koeneman, the adoption coordinator, is the brain behind the event all. Many phone calls and emails and a helpful staff pulled it all together, she said.\nThe Humane Society's offerings in the community extend beyond adoptions. The shelter's food pantry supports feeding animals in the community, and its intervention program can help a family with unexpected pet bills.\n\"We want the pets to stay with the ones who love them,\" Crankshaw-Quimby said.\nThere were several community stakeholders who popped up tents or umbrellas at the adoption event, including the Talbot County Public Library, Shore United Bank, Maryland WIC, Talbot Hospice and Mid Shore Behavioral Health. Others included Talbot Interfaith Shelter and Healthy Talbot.\nThe foster program is what most people start with when adopting a pet. It is like a two week trial to see if the animal is a good fit. Talbot Humane volunteer Alan Williams said there are plenty of animals to adopt.\nAnother volunteer, Mary Anne Petschke, said there are litter after litter of kittens still in foster care waiting to be old enough to adopt.\nNo animals leave the humane society without being spayed and microchipped. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: God's provision is nourishment for the soul\n\n August 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILLY JOHNSON | Section: Columns \n \n 298\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Throughout the Bible, we see a beautiful and consistent theme: God, like a joyous chef in the kitchen, always provides a feast for His people.From the very beginning, in the Garden of Eden, God set the table for humanity, providing every kind of plant for food (Genesis 2:9). This theme continues with the Passover feast, where the Israelites ate the lamb as a sign of God's deliverance from Egypt (Exodus 12).\nAs the Israelites journeyed through the wilderness, God provided manna from heaven, sustaining them daily (Exodus 16). This miraculous bread was a daily reminder of His constant care. Similarly, the prophet Isaiah paints a picture of a grand feast of rich foods and well-aged wines, symbolizing the Lord's generous provision and the promise of a future filled with His blessings (Isaiah 25:6).\nLooking ahead, the Bible speaks of a glorious wedding feast of the Lamb in Revelation 19:9, where believers will gather in celebration and communion with Christ. This image points us to the ultimate fulfillment of God's provision and fellowship with His people.\nJesus is the ultimate picture of this when He declares, \"I am the bread of life that came down from heaven\" (John 6:51).\nJust as God provided manna in the desert, He now offers spiritual nourishment through Jesus. In Christ, we find not only our daily bread but the sustenance for our souls.\nAs we reflect on these biblical feasts, let's remember that God's provision is not just about physical sustenance but also about spiritual nourishment. He invites us to His table, where we can find rest, refreshment and joy in His presence. Let's embrace this divine provision with gratitude and share it with our community, knowing that the Lord who fed His people in the past continues to feed us today with His love and grace. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Celebrating grandparents and family recipes\n\n September 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1184\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Grandparents Day is Sunday, Sept. 8, and what an important day for that grandparent in your life. It's also a time to reflect on the memories you have of those special ones from the past.I know that personally some of my favorite memories were made with my own grandparents in the 1950s and '60s, and therefore the past 25 to 30 years I am making those memories with my own grandchildren.\nTimes have changed with the activities we do in today's world, but the joy, pleasures, experiences, adventures and memories are just as important.\nIt seems that it wasn't that many years ago I laid in a pile of fresh raked autumn leaves with bugs crawling everywhere and helped my grandson destroy neat piles of leaves just for fun. His dad stood nearby shaking his head saying, \"had I done that she would have been like a mad hen and made me re-rake it all.\" And I said, \"yeah but this is my grandbaby.\"\nI know my readers are smiling as they read this because they do or have done the same thing. Enjoy these moments with your grandchildren and great grandchildren, and if you don't have any, then share these days with somebody who has no one in their life, whether they are related to you or not. Maybe it is a neighborhood child, a child you mentor, or a classmate of your grandchildren. Just a few moments of your time can change an outlook on life.\nToday I am doing recipes that grandparents have made throughout the years and that have been passed from generation to generation. I will start with a simple pot roast recipe that one of my grandsons thinks there is no other like it. It is so easy to do.\nMASON'S FAVORITE POT ROASTFresh cut 2-to-3-pound beef roast with fat on the bottom, oil for cooking, beef stock, salt, black pepper, potatoes, carrots, onions.\nSpray the bottom of a crockpot and turn on high to heat the oil. In the meantime, rinse the roast with cool water, drain and place in the crock with fat side on the bottom. Pour about 2 cups of beef stock, reserving the rest. Sprinkle the top of the roast with light salt and black pepper — place the lid on top and continue cooking. Peel several potatoes, cut them in quarters and place in a bowl of cool water. Add several unpeeled carrots to the water, chopping them into quarters, unless you use the small carrots. Peel several onions, chop them into quarters. Drain water from veggies, place them in a crockpot around the roast. Add more liquid only if needed — do not cover roast with liquid. Place lid on, turn to medium heat and cook until beef and veggies are tender. You may need to add additional seasonings — after about 70 — 80 minutes cooking I drop a couple of brown gravy seasoning liquid drops in the stock for further seasoning. Continue to cook until tender. When beef and veggies are tender, remove from the juice. In a casserole dish place veggies around the beef, adding a small amount of juice, about 1/2 inch. Cover tightly. Save remaining juice to add some dumplings or a thickened brown gravy.\nOLD FASHIONED EASY SUGAR COOKIES2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda, ½ tsp baking powder, 1 cup butter (softened), 1 ½ cups white sugar, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla extract.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. Stir flour, baking soda and baking powder together in a small bowl. Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in egg and vanilla. Gradually blend in flour mixture. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. At this point, add as many sprinkles as you want.\nEASTERN SHORE SWEET POTATO BISCUITS2 cups mashed sweet potatoes, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 1/4 cups flour, 1 1/4 tsp salt, 2 tsps baking powder, 5 tbsps shortening.\nMix mashed sweet potatoes with sugar, flour, salt and baking powder. Add 5 shortening last and mix dough. Roll dough and cut with biscuit cutter or roll into small balls 3/4 inch thick. Bake at 450 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes.\nFRIED CHICKENChicken, salt, 1 1/2 cups flour, pepper, paprika, 1 1/2 cups shortening.\nWash one frying chicken or broiler in cold water and cut into pieces. Soak in cold water for a few minutes with 1 teaspoon of salt. Drain chicken. Season flour with salt, pepper and paprika to taste. Heat shortening in a fry pan. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture and place in the oil. Cook until golden brown on both sides — about 20 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels. I usually mix my flour mixture in a brown paper bag and shake to coat. I also save the flour mixture to make gravy in the grease when chicken is cooked.\nGRANDMOTHERS SOUTHERN COLLARD GREENS3 tbsps lard or shortening (divided), 1 large onion (chopped), 6 garlic cloves (minced), 1 1/2 pounds smoked ham hocks, 6 cups water, 2 tsps seasoned salt, 1 to 3 tsps crushed red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp sugar, 1 large bunch collard greens (about 2 pounds, coarsely chopped).\nIn a 6-qt stockpot, heat 1 tbsp lard over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until tender. Add ham hocks, water, seasoned salt, pepper flakes and sugar. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, until meat is tender, 55 to 60 minutes. Add collard greens and remaining 1 tbsp. lard. Return to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, until greens are very tender, 55 to 60 minutes. Remove meat from bones; finely chop and return to pan. Discard bones. Serve with a slotted spoon.\nGRANDMOTHERS CORN PUDDING4 large eggs, 1 cup whole milk, 1 can (15 oz) cream-style corn, 1/2 cup sugar, 5 slices day-old bread (crusts removed), 1 tbsp butter (softened).\nIn a bowl, beat eggs and milk. Add corn and sugar; mix well. Cut bread into 1/2-inch cubes and place in a greased 9-inch square baking dish. Pour egg mixture over bread. Dot with butter. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes.\nGRANDMA'S PARTY POTATOES12 medium potatoes (peeled and quartered), 2 tbsps butter, 2 tbsps milk, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1 package (8 oz) cream cheese (softened), 1 carton (8 oz) French onion dip, paprika.\nPlace potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain. Mash the potatoes with butter, milk, salt and pepper until smooth. Add cream cheese and onion dip; mix well. Spread in a greased 2 1/2 qt baking dish. Sprinkle it with paprika. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours or overnight. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake, uncovered, until heated through, 50 to 60 minutes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled (NIV).\" Fortunately, we're here today because God found righteousness in a man named Noah.Even today, we are prone to sin, whatever our upbringing. We might be christened as babies and baptized into a church, we might go through childhood going to Sunday School and church every Sunday, but we are going to sin. But God still loves us.\nWe might grow to adulthood and become so dedicated to serving God that we go on missionary trips, memorize the Bibl, and go to Christian schools. We might become deacons or pastors, but even if we know and serve God and Jesus all our lives, we are still going to sin, and we are still going to be sinners. It's part of our nature.\n\"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\" No matter how good we are, no matter how faithful, we will, on occasion, do wrong. The inclination to do wrong is in our hearts. God sees this. It's a part of our make-up, it's in the genes, it's in our DNA. But He still loves us.\nWe have always done wrong and we always will do wrong. God knows this better than we do, and it is because of our constant shortcomings that God sent His Son. Through Christ Jesus, we can wash our sins away. Yes, God still loves us. He always has, and He always will. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

On the way back we began discussing politics. He is an avid Trump supporter and I'm not. I am an independent through and through.By the time I dropped him off at his house, the conversation had become heated. He's passionate about what he believes and that's part of why I admire him. Shortly after I got home, he called. His message was clear. He apologized for being so intense and told me our friendship was more important to him than our politics.\nThat's a real friend and a real American.\nOn Tuesday of last week I put up one of the only Harris banners I have seen this season in Caroline County. It flew in the breeze along Route 313 for three days and then one night it disappeared. The banner was well secured so I'm certain it was removed by someone intentionally. It was not the act of a patriot, an American or a well-adjusted human being. This experience amplifies the difference for me between the opposing sides in this year's election.\nI have no strong feelings about Kamala Harris, but as a recovering social studies teacher I am quite taken by the candidacy of Tim Walz. I now see one side as dark, destructive and dictatorial. The removal of the banner made me feel like I am living in a potential dictatorship. I will replace the banner, but its disappearance was certainly a clarifying event for me. The vandal has made me a more determined supporter of the Harris ticket than before. I rest my case.\nPETER TAILLIE\nGreensboro \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

One thing for us to consider is that poor relationships with others can hinder our prayers.When our kids were little, we would give them rewards for doing things around the house. We would tell them that if they picked up the toys in their room or took out the trash, we would go out for ice cream.\nBut at times, they would begin to argue and fight with each other while they were trying to earn their reward. During those times, I would simply say, \"if you are going to fight, we are not going.\"\nJesus said, \"…you can pray for anything, and if you believe that you've received it, it will be yours. But when you are praying, first forgive anyone you are holding a grudge against, so that your Father in heaven will forgive your sins, too.\" (Mark 11:24-25; NLT)\nIn other words, God says, \"You can pray, and I will give you the desires of your hearts. But if you have some things going on in your relationship with someone else, you need to get that cleared up first.\"\nThe Apostle Peter tells husbands to honor their wives and to treat them with great respect, so that \"…your prayers will not be hindered.\" (1 Peter 3:7; NLT)\nBitterness, disrespect and unforgiveness in our hearts will hinder our prayers before God. As a father, how our kids treat each other matters to me. To our Heavenly Father, how his kids treat each other matters to Him.\nYour relationships with each other matter, and your prayers can be hindered if those relationships are not what they should be. Let's work on our relationships. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Maryland stories: Couple celebrates 70th wedding anniversary\n\n September 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1224\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Nancy Peterson had employment lined up in her native Boston for the Summer of 1953, so she could make some money to help cover expenses before starting her senior year at Wheaton College near Chicago in the fall.Much to her disappointment, however, that job fell through.\nSo, Nancy accepted a summer job as a camp counselor at what is now known as Sandy Cove Ministries Christian Retreat Center, south of North East.\nAnd that's how she met her future husband, Ralph Reisler... Well, that's sort of how they met.\nOn Tuesday, Ralph and Nancy celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary, a special day featuring delivered flowers sent by family members, friends and Ralph and dinner at a popular Cecil County restaurant.\n\"We see God's hand in how we met,\" Nancy said matter-of-factly while relaxing on a living room sofa inside the couple's home near Rising Sun.\nSeated right next to his bride of seven decades, Ralph smiled and nodded in agreement.\nIt would be a much easier love story to tell if Nancy and Ralph had met at Sandy Cove while both worked there as camp counselors. That streamlined love story would include their summer friendship blossoming into love and leading them to the altar to exchange their wedding vows.\nBut Ralph didn't work at Sandy Cove.\nWhen Nancy traveled some 350 miles south to work at that camp as a counselor in the Summer of '53, Ralph, a native Cecil Countian, was living on his family's dairy farm near Rising Sun. And he was working as a physicist at Aberdeen Proving Ground, where he and his colleagues conducted research on explosions.\nOK, so if Ralph was working a good 25 miles away from Sandy Cove at that time, studying blasts on a military installation, how did he and Nancy cross paths?\nThis is where Ruth — Ralph's sister — enters their love story.\nAs it turns out, Ruth worked that summer as a Sandy Cove camp counselor, just like Nancy, and they had the same shift schedule. As Nancy and Ruth worked together at that Christian camp, they discovered commonalities and their friendship grew. (Ruth passed away in 2014.)\n\"Ruth also went to Wheaton College, but I had never met her before coming to Sandy Cove,\" Nancy noted.\nRuth invited Nancy to a family dinner on one of their shared off days. Because they were camp counselors, Nancy and Ruth lived at Sandy Cove that summer.\n\"She took me home with her — and there was Ralph,\" summarized Nancy, breaking into a smile.\nTheir conversation came relatively easy, considering that, according to Nancy, she wasn't very outgoing back then.\nSo how did Ralph feel after spending some time with Nancy during that family dinner?\n\"I was thinking, 'I better ask her out',\" Ralph recalled.\nAnd Ralph did just that, which led to another date and then another . . .\nThe Summer of '53 ended way too soon, however, and Nancy returned to Wheaton College, where she later would earn her elementary education degree.\nShe and Ralph kept in touch through letters.\nRalph also made a point to see Nancy in person as much as he was able to do so. During the next year, Ralph traveled periodically to Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean and to Nevada, as part of a work-related project. At both places, Ralph and his colleagues researched large explosive blasts.\nHis westward travels typically included a Chicago stopover, allowing him to spend time with Nancy.\n\"Back in those days, airlines would allow you to get off a plane at an airport that was on the way and get on another one heading to your (original) destination, without having to pay extra,\" Ralph explained, before noting, \"Wheaton College is about 25 miles west of Chicago. So I planned my work trips so I could do a little courting.\"\nFlash forward to Christmas 1953: The couple was seated together inside his parents' home when Ralph asked Nancy to marry him.\nFor the sake of spinning one of those dreamy love stories, it would have been fitting if Ralph and Nancy were lounging in front of crackling, dancing flames inside a brick fireplace when he popped the question. But they actually were keeping warm in front of a space heater.\nAnd it would have been more storybook romantic if Ralph had dropped to one knee and slipped a diamond ring on Nancy's finger when he proposed. He did neither.\nThe kicker, though, was Nancy's answer — or lack thereof.\n\"I didn't give him an answer right away. I told him I needed to think about it. This was a big thing,\" Nancy said.\nRalph's feelings weren't hurt, though, because he understood Nancy's perspective.\nHe accounted for the fact that he was 25 and already had graduated from college, something Nancy was trying to achieve. Interesting fact: Ralph graduated from Wheaton College with a physics degree in 1949, one year before Nancy had arrived on that campus to start her academic career. Ralph also considered the fact that Nancy was 19 when they met.\nSo he gave Nancy time to think and to pray because both understood what a major commitment marriage is. Ralph still gently made Nancy aware of his feelings for her, though, in the months that followed. \"I was persistent,\" Ralph said.\nFlash forward to May of 1954: Ralph and Nancy are together on the front lawn of the Wheaton College campus, where Ralph pulls out an engagement ring and, once again, asks Nancy to marry him. Ralph didn't drop to one knee during the proposal — but that is OK.\n\"This was a little more romantic,\" Nancy said, laughing. \"He said all the right things and kissed me.\"\nNancy said yes, of course.\nRalph and Nancy exchanged their wedding vows at her family's church near Boston on Sept. 17, 1954 — eight days before Ralph turned 26. Ralph turns 96 on Wednesday.\n\"The joke is, I asked God to be married by 25 and He did it with eight days to spare,\" Ralph said.\nRalph and Nancy have five sons — ranging in age from 54 to 68 — and 12 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.\nAs for the reason they have been happily married for 70 years, Ralph and Nancy are quick to give God all of the glory.\nActive members of Grace Bible Chapel near Rising Sun for nearly as long as they've been married, Ralph and Nancy believe that God wanted them to meet each other and that He made it happen in an interesting, roundabout way.\nRemember the beginning of this perfect love story?\nNancy's first perceivable step toward Ralph was the disappointment that she experienced when her summer job in Boston fell through some 71 years ago, changing her plans and putting her on a new path — which led to her to Sandy Cove, which led her to Ruth, which, in turn, led her to Ralph.\nBecause Ralph and Nancy have personal relationships with God, they have been able to hold onto His guiding hand throughout their 70 years of marriage, at the highest peaks and through the deepest valleys.\n\"Following God's precepts and going to church,\" Ralph opined with little hesitation, when asked to give some keys to a long, successful marriage.\nRalph's comment prompted Nancy to quote Matthew 6:33, which essentially explains that blessings come to those who have their priorities in proper order in God's eyes. That Bible passage in the New Living Translation reads, \"Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and He will give you everything you need.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hymns included \"Amazing Grace\" and Parks' favorite, \"How Great Thou Art.\"\n\"Very good,\" Parks said after the last verse of her favorite hymn was sung.\nParks, who has lived her whole life in Talbot County, has lived at The Dixon House for five years. She lived independently until she was 102.\nParks still walks and uses the exercise room, activity director Shelly LaRoque said. She had been known to be one of the first to the activity room in the past, always ready with her calendar in hand. Even as recently as six months ago, Parks was still crocheting.\nParks' daughter-in-law Betty Parks said just a few weeks ago, Edna joined members of The Dixon House in going down to St. Michaels to take a tour on The Patriot, a historic cruise operated by the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum. \"When they go, she's ready,\" Betty Parks said of her mother-in-law.\nEdna's longevity can been attributed to multiple factors, family members said.\n\"Well it's a miracle, that's what it is,\" Betty Parks said. \"She's blessed.\"\nHer son and daughter-in-law said she's never had major surgeries and avoided hard labor during her life. That, along with a daily soda, has kept her healthy.\n\"She has her Coke every day, doctor's orders,\" Betty Parks joked. \"We made him write it down on the paper.\"\nEdna's son, Roger, was grateful for The Dixon House's celebration and for another year of life for his mom.\n\"She's doing great, and she's happy there,\" Roger Parks said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Proverbs 14:12 says, \"There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.\"\nThe death spoken of in this verse is that of an eternal separation from God, so I dare not just shrug my shoulders and say, \"Whatever.\"\nWhat resolve is God looking for in a person's response to Him? The Scriptures make it clear that His approval of me is not based on the production of good things that I do in my lifespan. (Isaiah 64:6)\nDavid in Psalm 51:17 informs us that \"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.\" God is looking for people who humbly admit their sin, and then turn in faith to Jesus for His forgiveness. (John 3:16)\nColossians 1:13 tells us that Jesus came to rescue us from Satan's domain and to transfer us into His kingdom. This provision puts us on the road that leads to a forever home in heaven with all who believe in what Jesus has done for us.\nOur faith is not based on what we have done, but on what God has done on our behalf. John 3:1–21 is a great read for anyone who wants to be sure of being on the right road. May God give us honesty of heart and mind to evaluate where the road we are on ends up. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

David Casey-Motley Immanuel Lutheran Church | Section: Columns \n \n 285\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Christianity is full of mystery, and yet, in another way, it's simple.The truth, in summary, could be placed on a page. Christ, born of Mary, is God's eternal Son. There is one God, three persons, Father, Son, Holy Spirit. Christ died as a payment for our sins, satisfying justice, a propitiation for our sins. Neither the works of the saints nor our own works in any way contribute to our salvation, which is wholly won by our Lord. As Christ's rose from the dead, so shall we, and when we rise we will see our returning Lord face to face. All of this is attested to in the scriptures, which are God's word.\nAnd then, yes, baptism brings infants into the family of God, making them heirs of salvation. Why would we think that baby boys are somehow Israelites via circumcision, but our own baptized children are not Christian?\nBy instinct, then by our Lord's teaching about children. The Lord's Supper is the true body and blood, and brings to us the work of the cross, bringing us into communion with Christ. In baptism, we become members of Christ's body, and in the Supper, we take Christ's body into ourselves.\nAll of this is to say, doctrine is one, and it is whole, and there is no barrier in understanding. This is not a matter of depending upon a magisterium, for the scriptures are clear. I am happy to teach this stuff, but it is not so high or deep that you or anyone cannot get it. For it is God's Word that does the work. It is He who saves, forgives, and gives grace. It is His and His alone. May it ever be so. Amen. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Over 200 people came to the sold out 7 a.m. annual prayer breakfast held at the Easton Volunteer Fire Department. On Thursday amens from the dressed-up crowd reached to the rafters.Sheriff Joe Gamble was the master of ceremonies who introduced the 13 speakers at the event. They focused on their faith and how their life stories shaped their relationship with God. Some were pastors and reverends. Some were politicians, educators and business leaders. Many hugs were given and hands were held high in reverence. Biblical passages from protective wings to deadly pestilence were read.\nGamble said, \"We are really excited with a sellout crowd, and we have got some great speakers today. We have 230 or 240 people. We can't thank the Volunteer Fire Company enough. They donated the space today.\"\nPrayers were directed to leaders of the town. There were prayers for first responders, educators and the nation at large. There was a special acknowledgement to Paul Carroll who has kept the 41-year tradition of the prayer breakfast alive. He serves on a committee that keeps the prayer breakfast going.\n\"We realize the importance of prayer and we need to continue this,\" Carroll said. \"It is a different venue, but we are happy to have it. After the food, we have two speakers Jimmy Rogers and Wendy Palmer.\"\nRogers told how he died and came back to life convinced in his faith. He served in Vietnam as a Marine and then joined the Easton Police Department. Although he had to read his remarks because of a traumatic brain injury, he held the audience's attention.\n\"I would like to share with you the story of God's incredible works in my life,\" Rogers said. \"It includes miracles, forgiveness, incredible acts of healing, redemption and saving a person totally unworthy of such acts.\"\nHe had a heart attack and died in his bathroom. His wife found him.\n\"She found me on the floor, not breathing and no pulse. She called 911 and started CPR. This was not a near-death experience. It meets all the clinical criteria for death,\" Rogers said.\nWhen the EMTs arrived, they shocked him multiple times and tried to revive him for 20 minutes. One last effort induced a weak pulse. They rushed him to the hospital.\n\"I had a 98% blockage in the coronary artery known as the widow maker,\" he said.\nIn that death experience, he had a vision of a friend who had died two years earlier.\n\"I was walking through the woods. The sun shining more than you can possibly imagine. The leaves had incredible colors. The air was crisp and clear, and I came to a stream of crystal clear water cascading over the rocks. It was absolutely heavenly, and I have never felt such peace. I never wanted to leave this place,\" Rogers said.\nHe saw his friend on the other side of the river. The friend told Rogers to go back. Then Rogers awoke from his coma. He wonders if it was a glimpse of the after life or just a drug-induced dream. As Rogers told his story, the room was silent, the crowd engrossed in his testimony.\nThe second testimony came from Wendy Palmer, director of chronic diease and prevention programs at the YMCA of the Chesapeake. She spoke of service both in her role as a 31-year restauranteur and now helping people to get moving at the Y.\n\"It is never to late. At 57 on December the 19th, I was born again. I was baptized,\" Palmer said.\nShe says she is in her infancy of faith but is a lifelong learner.\n\"I get to help people move and feel good and be in community. And I tell our staff and our team at the Y that everybody comes to our Y — the front porch of the community as Robbie Gill refers to the Y — to be seen, to be heard and to be loved,\" Palmer said.\n\"If we can do that everyday in a way that magnifies our Lord, He will be so proud of us and our work.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Divided by economics, nationality, race, social status, and in the U.S.A, specifically during this time of national elections, political affiliation.\nIt seems impossible to get through this cycle without increasing venom, hatred or suspicion. We do well to recall Proverbs 21:2, KJV saying: \"Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, But the Lord weighs the heart\".\nKindness, understanding and just plain decency seem to be lost at times. As never before, the admonition given to us in the Bible found in Romans 12:18 seems to be worth our consideration.\n\"If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.\"\nWe don't have to agree on every position, but that doesn't make us enemies. We don't have to have the same world view, but that doesn't have to also create division between us. Let's agree that we are a diverse community with different views but linked together with a common thread, and let brotherly love continue. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gedman St. Luke’s Global Methodist Church | Section: Columns \n \n 312\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n While the world and its ways are always subject to change at the whims of those in control, God and the Bible are not subject to change.In a world of seemingly endless lies, we must remember that truth is not subject to new whims or reimagining. It is not up for negotiation. The truth does not change. It is objective, not subjective.\nWhen reading the Bible, the truth is often disclosed by the definite article \"the.\" It is stated definitively and singularly. One does not have to connect bits and pieces of a verse here and a verse there to find the truth, it is discernibly clear.\nFor example, Jesus said, \"I am the way and the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father except by me.\" Notice that there are four statements of absolute truth in that sentence all highlighted by the definite article.\nJesus did not say, \"I am a way.\" There are not many ways to God. Also, rather importantly, the definite article is set before \"Father\" as well. This highlights the fact that there is only one God the Father, not many gods.\nTruth is not a series of ideas pulled, redacted, edited and restated from manifold sources. One will not discover the truth of God through the study of comparative religions or philosophies. It is found only in the Bible. There is but one way of salvation; Jesus the Christ. (Note my inclusion of the definite article for Jesus is the one and only Messiah).\nUltimately, the Bible is the perfect standard of truth. It defines truth as being absolutely reliable and enduring. The reason is quite simple: Authentic, biblical truth is inextricably linked to the dependable, unchanging character of God.\nYou can trust everything He says; He never lies; He always keeps His Word; He's faithful to all His promises. Thanks be to God we have the Bible. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It's not a season everyone likes or voted for but the season is changing. For some it's better, for some it's worse. For some it's good news, for some it's bad news.Your perspective colors your season. For example, if you love autumn then you have enjoyed the current season in much of America. You haven't enjoyed it if you've been in the path of a hurricane, but you've enjoyed it if you live in most any other place in America. We've had a dry fall season, but it has been beautiful. Many dread the winter months, while some welcome cool weather over the long months of dry hot weather. If you live in Southern Arizona, you are ready for some cooler weather.\nPolitical seasons are hard on our nation. We've been immersed in political advertisements for months. The presidential campaign has gone on forever. We are so ready to move forward. For many in America this doesn't feel good while others think it's great.\nSeasons come and seasons go. No season lasts forever. There is always a new season around the corner. It's best for all of us if we can make the best of whatever the season of life is at the time. Winter or summer, make the most of the season. Youth or old age, they pass by so enjoy your season. Small children or adult children, love them and roll with the seasons. Young parents or old parents, roll with the seasons. Making great money or making less money, roll with the seasons.\nTry to make the best of your current season in life. It's not always easy. We don't like the seasons of life when we are sick or even dying. Some seasons are difficult and even harsh and cruel, but they come to us all if we live long enough. So, enjoy the good seasons, tread water or make the best of what seems to be a bad season because in time in some way the season will change. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

HINES Eternal Life Ministries | Section: Columns \n \n 436\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As I sit here recovering from a lung infection, I am reminded that I still have a reason to be thankful to God for all He has done for me and all that He is to me. I am led to reflect upon Psalm 138:1-8.This is a psalm of David, and it was sung by him as a declaration of high praise unto Almighty, God our heavenly Father, for His excellent greatness. It is a bold statement made by the psalmist because it expresses the human soul's deep need to worship the creator and articulates the heartfelt sentiment that God alone is worthy of all our praise.\nDavid says, \"I will praise the Lord with my whole heart, that means with a heart that is fully committed to pouring out the oil of gratitude as a sacrifice of thanksgiving upon the altar of God. I will praise my God with all that I have in me, and I will do it in the presence of everything and everybody that this world has exalted, to show forth my estimation that there is no God like Yahweh.\"\nDavid further declares that he will always turn toward the God of his salvation to worship Him because of His lovingkindness and for His truth.\nAnd we can bear witness to that, for we know that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son so that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. In a world of lies and deceit, this is the one truth that can cut through every falsehood that Satan has deceived us with concerning ourselves and bring us into the marvelous light of the Gospel.\nDavid said of God, \"in the day that I cried out to you, you answered me and gave me strength deep down in my soul.\" How many of you know what it's like to cry out to God during your time of troubles and God answered your prayers and gave you strength to run on to see what the end was going to be? That should make you feel grateful that God, Almighty took the time to incline His ear to hear your cries and deliver you from your distress.\nIn the light of all the wonderful things that God has bestowed upon us and considering the magnitude of all that He alone is, David just could not help but to give our God all praise.\nAnd when you and I look at our lives after all that the Lord has done for us, we too should not be able to withhold our praise from Him and shout Hallelujah. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Always plenty to be thankful for in Maryland\n\n November 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editorials \n \n 740\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It should be easy for most of us to be thankful in Maryland. Thanksgiving has just about arrived, that special day for reflection, for sharing our gratitude and for enjoying a splendidly large meal with those we love.We've mostly been spared the political rancor that marked much of the election season nationwide. The local campaigning leading up to filling out our ballots earlier this fall was mostly crisp and clean.\nSo as we prepare ourselves for the Thanksgiving holiday, let's hope that peace and civility will prevail, at least for a day. Let's hope that when extended families convene for the old familiar feast, debate won't rage between red and blue, but about whether dark meat is more delicious than white meat as the turkey is carved.\nThanksgiving is a legacy of early colonial America, when European settlers thanked God for the harvest that allowed people to survive under difficult conditions. These days, of course, only a dwindling portion of our population here still has lives so closely tied to the harvest. Most of us take comfortable shelter and an adequate food supply for granted every day.\nDid you know that we have a president, a secretary of state and the author of \"Mary Had A Little Lamb\" to thank for Thanksgiving becoming a fully recognized holiday in the United States?\nEditor and writer Sarah Josepha Hale launched her campaign in 1827 to see the annual Thanksgiving tradition dating back a couple hundred years become an official holiday. She started with President John Quincy Adams — son of Founding Father John Adams — and finally found success many years later with President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. Secretary of State William Seward penned Lincoln's proclamation, which came in \"the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity.\"\n\"I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a Day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens,\" Lincoln's proclamation reads.\nWell, 2024 has certainly been a year, but we still have so much to be thankful for, each and everyone of us.\nIn a way, we're all accidents of birth, and ongoing accidents of geography. We could be anywhere else in the world — and plenty of those places have more than enough misery to go around. Gratitude for our peace, safety and security here at home would be in order.\nWe should also be thankful for the people in our community who will be required to postpone their feasts to help others in need. We can take comfort in knowing that police and hospital staff will be on the job, and volunteer firefighters and other first responders could be pressed into service at any time if there's an emergency.\nThen there are those thoughtful souls who make sure that anyone who wants to come out can enjoy an absolutely free hot Thanksgiving family-style meal and fellowship. Food banks, soup kitchens and churches around the region help make sure that happens.\nFor sure, this holiday season that officially kicks off next week and runs all the way through New Year's Day can stretch time, money and sometimes patience particularly thin. But let's face it, most of us have plenty for which to be thankful. And we should have little reason not to feel blessed and grateful on Thanksgiving and every day.\nOur community is strong. And through the works large and small of all our friends and neighbors, we will only continue to get stronger. And for that, too, we offer our thanks.\nEven in our nation's darkest times, Lincoln and Seward found much to be celebrated: \"The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and even soften the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God.\"\nWe can all take their words to heart as we head into the holiday season. We can look to the good. We can focus on the positive. We can find our way forward with thankfulness and love in our hearts.\nWe wish you all a happy Thanksgiving. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A Mission Impossible Thanksgiving accomplished in Easton\n\n December 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 643\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Six days before Thanksgiving, Sandra Adams and Amanda Dow took it upon themselves to organize and execute a dinner for those in need. With help from local organizations and dozens of volunteers, they were able to accomplish something beyond their expectations.In the course of less than a week, Adams and Dow organized a full Thanksgiving dinner serving over 70 meals to families from the Eastern Shore and gave out essential goods such as winter coats and hygiene products.\nFor Adams, helping those in need is not a new experience. She began the nonprofit Friends Helping Friends Network based on her experiences of being a single mom and her struggles of trying to make ends meet for her family.\n\"No matter how hard I worked, I never made enough money, and I was always told that I made too much money, even though I knew I didn't and I've ended up homeless several times myself, and just different experiences of struggling,\" Adams said.\nDow said she would help Adams during previous events hosted by Friends Helping Friends Network and said Adams is the kind of person who always finds a way to assist the people around her, whether it be helping someone find temporary housing or assisting in resume reviews for those who need work.\nFor Dow, working with Adams on this dinner reminded her of the work she did growing up, when her parents had a nonprofit. When Adams started talking about a potential Thanksgiving event for the community, Dow was more than eager to help make it happen.\n\"We had decided that no matter what, we were going to do something, we just weren't quite sure what that would look like,\" Dow said. \"And the owners of the Spaghetti House were gracious enough to come back and say, 'You know what, it can't hurt to help. So you guys, do your thing, make sure you're safe.'\"\nAccording to Dow, by the time Spaghetti House approved the use of their venue, Dow and Adams had only six days to make the dinner happen. They asked business owners in the community to donate as much as they could but had low expectations for turnout due to the short timeline.\nWhat none of them expected was the rush of community support they received to make the event happen.\nFood donations began to come in from Teddy Bear Fresh, Legal Assets, Blu Miles Seafood and Grill, Hot Off The Coals and Darnell's Grill and Catering, who donated several cooked turkeys.\nThe amount of food donated allowed them to go beyond their plans of a simple meal. Adams and Dow were able to give attendees a feast.\nAdditionally, Tahlia Pabon, owner of Tahlia's Virtual Solutions, LLC and co-host of the event, offered attendees with free resume services.\nAdams said through donations they were also able to provide coats, scarves and other necessities.\nWhen Thursday evening finally came, Adams said the venue was packed with over 40 volunteers and dozens of families, each enjoying their meals while the room filled with music provided by DJ Jason Young.\nDow said attendees came with expectations of a meal and left with filled stomachs, bags of donated food, coats and other necessities for long-term care.\nBeyond the event, she plans to continue care for those who need it and encourages anyone who would like to volunteer to contact her on Facebook and to come with an open mind and heart.\n\"We never know what everyone is going through. And I just ask that people look in other people's eyes and see their heart and know that even if people are stuck or homeless, they need a hand up,\" Adams said. \"(Friends Helping Friends Network's) motto is 'taking those around us to help those around us,' because it's not just about me helping them, it's about all of us jumping on board to lift up that hand and that's what we plan on doing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Don't let challenges overcome your Christmas season\n\n December 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: GLENN MOLLETTE | Section: Columns \n \n 525\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Christmas is a joyful season but always has some challenges.The place of Christmas is often a question. Mary and Joseph ended up in Bethlehem when Jesus was born. They had gone there to pay taxes. Paying taxes is never fun but something we have to do. The place they ended up when Jesus was born was probably not their desired location to bear their first child, but they made the most of the location.\nLocation trips a lot of people up on Christmas. Many have no choice. They will spend Christmas in the nursing home or jail. Many have no options. They may be too elderly or sick to travel. They may not have any place to go. If you have options then be thankful. If you have a place to spend Christmas then this is one of your best gifts of all. Don't fight about the place where you will spend Christmas. Make the best of wherever you end up and celebrate with whoever is around.\nThe presents of Christmas are often stressful. Presents are expensive and often we don't know what to buy and how much to spend. You may have a lot of gifts to buy or maybe you don't have a single person for whom you will buy a gift. If you can afford to buy gifts and want to then enjoy the opportunity. If finances are meager this year, then be honest with yourself and others and say our list and budget is very limited this year. Don't put yourself in financial jeopardy by spending money you don't have. The greatest gift is the baby Jesus. Focusing on Him will bring more peace than a house filled with gifts.\nThe pageantry of Christmas often becomes work. How many lights can you string on your roof or around your shrubbery? I enjoy putting up lights on a warm day but despise taking them down in January. Just remember what goes up must come down, eventually. Try to find a mild weather day, and you won't feel like the grinch.\nThe pressure of Christmas gets to a lot of people. People die in December. Loneliness takes over. Stress becomes paramount. People get depressed. Christmas should never be a time of loneliness, stress or pressure, but it was a difficult time for Mary and Joseph. They were poor people. Bringing a child into the world in a stable would not be considered an option for most of us. Traveling was a hassle and very difficult back then. While they were overjoyed with the baby Jesus, life's circumstances were not easy. Later, they would flee to Egypt for the safety of their family which had to add to their pressure.\nThe person of Christmas must be our focus in order to truly celebrate this season. Let's not lose sight of the main character in the Christmas story. If we do, then we will focus on the place, presents, pageantry and pressures of Christmas. Thus, we will miss out on the real joy that the heavenly host proclaimed to those shepherds watching their sheep.\n\"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\" (Luke 2:14). \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now it continues through his son Ed Nabb Jr.\nAs part of the Carlisle Mission Team, Michael Marra collected funds for construction materials for island home repair, including ramps and deck rails for many of the older or disabled residents.\nEvery summer for the past 10 years, missionaries go to the island for vacation Bible school, outreach and more, according to Marra.\nSince the 1600s, generations of families have lived on the island that faces environmental distress, and it is enormously important to try and keep that culture going, he said.\n\"To let them know they are not forgotten,\" he said. \"We're there to uplift their spirits as well as their houses.\"\nThrough a match in donations, over $15,000 was raised with all funds donated by Holly Run participants supporting the work.\nA newer member of Chesapeake Sport Pilot, this was pilot Lenora Kandiner's first time participating in the Holly Run. Kandiner last flew to Tangier Island in the 1980s from New Jersey. \"You can't be here without hearing about the Holly Run,\" she said.\n\"Pilots always want to fly somewhere, so here's a good cause,\" breakfast elf volunteer Sandy Dewey said.\nMore information about the Holly Run can be found at tangierhollyrun.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Polarization in our community and beyond\n\n December 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 772\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For almost 250 years the Merriam-Webster Dictionary has been a widely used resource to define, interpret and properly use the written and spoken words in our society.In 1996, Merriam-Webster introduced Merriam-Webster Online, a subscription-based website with unlimited access to the complete text of Webster's Third New International Dictionary.\nThis online dictionary has 470,000 words and regularly logs 100 million pageviews monthly.\nIn doing so, it has become especially useful for those who follow American's thinking and voting behavior.\nPeter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor-at-large, has noted, \"We've had dictionaries of English for 420 years, and it's only been in the last 20 years or so that we've actually known which words people look up.\"\nIn other words, now we can track, analyze and prioritize the words of greatest interest to Americans and the words of their greatest concern.\nSince 2020, the Merriam Webster website word tracking has shown the most frequently researched words in recent years were authentic, gaslighting, vaccine and pandemic.\nAs 2024 winds down, the No. 1 word for this year is … polarization.\nAs Merriam-Webster editor Sokolowski observes, polarization always means division, but it is an extremely specific kind of division. It can and does extend beyond politics. For example, polarization can occur with opinions about music styles, tech trends, food and sports teams.\nI agree that polarization occurs in countless areas of life beyond politics, but the impact on our society in those other areas are trivial when compared to polarization in the political arena.\nWell before the 2024 presidential election was held, American voters had strongly held opinions that each of the candidates from both major political parties were flawed and even an existential threat to democracy.\nAn Associated Press Vote Cast survey of more than 120,000 voters showed that about 80% of Kamala Harris supporters were very or somewhat concerned that Donald Trump's positions on current and emerging public policy issues were too extreme.\nThe survey results also showed that about 70% of Donald Trump voters were very or somewhat concerned that Kamala Harris' positions on current and emerging public policy issues were too extreme.\nSo far, the election results have done little to change those strongly held opinions.\nI suggest the election results have generated even more political polarization.\nWith that in mind, and consistent with their mission, Chesapeake Forum, an Easton-based, not- for- profit academy for lifelong learning recently hosted a program to provide attendees more information about this timely and important topic.\nAttendees learned about and discussed research done by Harvard professor Robert Putnam. That research led to Putnam's essay — \"Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital\" followed by his book \"Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community.\"\nAs a program attendee, I found this program to be most enlightening but also somewhat depressing.\nThe good news is we also learned about a more positive book by Putnam — \"Better Together.\"\n\"Better Together\" has been and continues to be a catalyst for the launch of initiatives in large and small communities across America. All share a common goal of developing and executing programs to help restore social capital, increase civil discourse and reduce political polarization in our society.\nOne reviewer of both books on Amazon's website wrote — \"Bowling Alone made people think, Better Together will make them act.\"\nChesapeake Forum has done both by continuing the synergy of their fall program with regular get togethers. The goals are to encourage more people in our community to think about the negative impact polarization has on our community as well as finding ways to help increase activities that rebuild social capital, increase civil discourse and reduce political polarization.\nThere is no shortage of ideas that have worked well elsewhere. That said, the Eastern Shore has a unique history and culture. Accordingly, some ideas from other places may work well here, some may not work at all here and some will work well here but only with changes.\nThe most important key to success going forward is involvement by a wide range of community leaders and citizens to collaborate on the evaluation of the most viable strategies to rebuild social capital, increase civil discourse and political polarization reduction strategies in our area.\nThe adage is true that people will be most likely to support change efforts if they have an opportunity to be involved in the development and implementation of those strategies.\nMore details on such opportunities will be available beginning early next year.\nStarting right now, you can be involved in this endeavor by going to Chesapeake Forum's website — chesapeakeforum.org, clicking on the contact us tab at the top of the page and then complete leaving a message with your contact information so they can keep you informed.\nAll questions, comments and suggestions are also welcomed and appreciated. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The club was able to help somewhat when three members traveled to Greenville, Tennessee, in early November to donate over 50 blankets, 20 child-sized throws and 15 tents that could hold eight people each.The people who would have received these supplies are in our thoughts today. It is good to know that those supplies might be bringing warmth and comfort to folks at this special time of year.\nAs we gather around our home fires, enjoying the holidays feeling comfortable and secure, we are hopeful that we have been able to ease their hardship in this small way.\nThe Christmas message has always been peace, love and joy. That never changes, in good times and bad.

It's my prayer that they have left us with kind and loving memories to encourage and keep us moving forward.\nAt Thanksgiving, we surrounded the table with family, friends and good food — what a blessing. At Christmas, we surrounded the tree with the gifts as we shared them with love from me to you — what a blessing.\nThe smiles, the joy, the laughter that we are so blessed to share at those times is not so easily afforded by many right around us.\nWe have been blessed to see a new year that was not promised. In the midst of all that we have faced as a people, families and a nation, we can all say that we have been kept by the hand and mercies of God Almighty.\nThe day-to-day challenges of having a roof over one's head, enough food to eat, proper medical care and medication is a struggle so real that sadly it's almost viewed as normal. The concern of a safe work place, safe schools and safe Houses of Worship are becoming high alert status.\nA fresh start is appealing to many — a new administration to lead the nation forward for a better and brighter future, to have a cost of living thats bearable and not a burden or for the Golden Rule to come alive in our hearts (to do unto others as we would have them do unto you).\nWe've celebrated Christmas, the birth of Jesus, the perfect gift given to mankind. Our fresh start born in a manger, crucified on the cross, buried in a borrowed tomb. Our fresh start rose on the third day. He's coming again in Glory to take unto himself his own.\nWhat ever state we may find ourselves in physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, socially, just know that Jesus is in our story.\nFor a true fresh start, come to Jesus.\nJohn 3:16… For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son the whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Doing this today will secure your greatest tomorrow.\nHappy fresh start. Happy New Year. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The date changes. Some of us will mess up writing a check a time or two because we'll write 2024 until it finally sinks in that we are in a new year.The new year means change. It always has, and this year will not be any different. We will see a changing of the guard in our presidency. President Biden is exiting after an unbelievable 50 or so years in national politics. President Trump is coming back, and he has done what no other human has done before. I'm not simply referring to being elected a second time after sitting out a term because that has happened.\nWhat I mean is no one has been vilified and harassed as he has been and even survived let alone ascend to the highest office in the world. January will bring immediate change upon his inauguration. However, it remains to be seen what will change and what won't.\nLife is always transitioning, but we sometimes have difficulty making the transition. Some men never get over their high school sports career. They live in the past of the time when they were star athletes, but that may have been 20 to 40 years ago. We often have great difficulty overcoming a failed relationship or marriage.\nIt happened 10 years ago, but the impact of it still troubles us. We often still grieve over the loss of a loved one who died 20 years ago. We still miss them and the joy they brought into our lives. We often cannot transition from our jobs or careers. We remember those 20 to 40 years that we worked a certain job or business. We look back to those days often as great days that we would like to go back to.\nIt's not easy to transition. The college freshman often misses their senior year of high school. Even as adults we remember those wonderful wasted days of childhood. The 35-year-old misses their teen years, the 80-year-old would like to be 50 again.\nOften, we dread birthdays. The actual birthdate brings a new number. The 15-year-old loves that 16 number because it means freedom to drive. The 64-year-old anticipates 65 and Medicare and the Social Security check soon to come.\nOur hope must be to transition as well as we can because transition is coming for us all.\nAn old preacher friend said, \"At every level there is a new devil.\" At every stage and age of life there are joys and obstacles. There are new struggles and also new opportunities.\nLet's make 2025 the best year we've ever had. That may not be easy, but it's worth a try and even if it's not our best year, keep in mind, it's the only year we have at this time.\nThe life we have today is the only life we have. We don't have yesterday or even tomorrow. Let's give 2025 our best effort and do our best to be here at this same time and place next year. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A couple of months later, while we were visiting and chatting about nothing, he asked me what my dinner plans were, and I told him wifey wanted me homemade chili and cornbread, but I didn't feel like stopping at the store.\nWe chatted a few more minutes when he quietly said, \"make the chili.\"\nIt took me a few minutes to realize we were no longer talking about dinner. It was about going out of your way to do something for someone you love because at any moment, they could unexpectedly be taken away from you.\nSo today I'm sharing with you that wisdom handed to me by my dear friend, that I've pondered many times since that day.\nThe next time someone you love, (especially our children) wants you to go for a walk or watch a football game or play a board game or just put your phone down and give them your undivided attention, just do it. \"Make the chili.\"\nMake the chili is a friendly reminder that life is short and as scripture tells us, no one knows the day nor the hour. None of us born of a woman knows when our time here on earth will be up. You will either have a heart full of regrets or a grateful heart full of memories.\nToday, and only today is our chance to choose.

These people are unseen by most of our readers, but without their dedicated work, the newspaper could not be produced.\nOne of those people is Dale Massey, who makes the plates that go on our printing press.\nFriday was Dale's last day at the newspaper. He retired after a career that spanned nearly 50 years, a career that has seen quantum leaps in the technology used to produce newspapers.\nDale joined the Seaford Leader the day after he graduated from high school in June 1976. The Leader then was part of Chesapeake Publishing, the precursor to Adams Publishing Group that now owns the Star Democrat.\nDale's first job was running the darkroom, but he also took photos for advertising copy. At one time, he found a side gig doing wedding photography.\nIn those days, long before computers eased the process of producing newspapers, type was set in lead. Now reporters and editors type on a computer and the words are digitally sent to production.\nDale worked with then Leader sports editor Ron MacArthur. He learned on the job how to be a sports photographer. In 1983, Dale became the sports editor in Seaford. He eventually went back to darkroom work and shooting advertising photos.\nIn the mid 1990s, the Seaford Leader was named best of show for the overall newspaper in all of Delaware, Maryland and the District of Columbia, one of the proud moments of Dale's career.\nIn 1996, the company moved its printing operations to Easton, and Dale began commuting from Seaford, something that continued until his retirement on Friday.\nWhile he continued doing photography and sports, he added other duties, including making and working with the negatives that were used to create plates for the press. A single color page in the newspaper requires four plates, one each for black, magenta, cyan and yellow inks. Those four plates, with screens of different intensities, create all of the different colors on a newspaper page.\nA giant camera, the size of a room, was used to make the negatives to create those plates.\nIn 2003, that giant camera and the negatives went away, and the newspaper began sending pages directly to plate.\n\"I've seen a lot of technology,\" Dale said. \"It's evolved; it's the evolution of doing things.\"\nThat technology, that evolution has meant there are fewer people doing the job than there were when Dale started nearly 50 years ago. The pre-press department that makes the plates for the press once had 10 people. Now there are two.\nMuch of the work is automated. Dale now sits at a computer and sends pages to a plate-making machine.\nThe plates roll out, about one every 30 seconds. In the old days, each plate would take almost 15 minutes to produce.\nThe job has evolved over the years, but one thing has stayed consistent, Dale's love for newspapers.\n\"It's like you have ink in your blood,\" he said.\nDale is just one of nearly 100 employees at the Star Democrat, many of whom say the same thing, they have ink in their blood. There's something about working at a newspaper. It's not just a job. Our employees help tell the stories of our communities. In a way, their jobs are part of preserving democracy in this country.\nIt's not just a job. It's a calling.\nYou might not know all of their names, but each one is an essential part of producing the Star Democrat and getting that newspaper to you.\nDale is not sure what all he will be doing in retirement, but he knows he'll be spending much more time with his 9-year-old grandson.\nOn Friday, colleagues stopped by to wish Dale luck as he moves on to the next phase of his life.\n\"I'll miss this place,\" Dale told one.\nWe'll miss Dale. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Hot chili on a cold day\n\n January 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1070\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The weather outside is freezing, wind blowing leftover snow across the driveway.After shoveling the snow or struggling to get home from work safely, open the kitchen door to the smells of hot chili steaming and freshly baked cornbread. This combination puts a smile on everyone's face — almost makes you want to go shovel snow and salt the ice again.\nI remember as a child getting to stay home from school was great, but a farm kid did not exactly get to sleep in until noon. The fun began after the chores were done.\nOur dad would hook the corn shuck sled, like a large wooden sled, up to the tractor and pull us across the fields. What a rough ride, and what fun.\nBack to the kitchen for that delicious bowl of chili and warm slice of cornbread. When it comes to chili, I like a dryer cornbread that helps to soak up the chili flavor.\nCOUNTRY DRY CORN BREAD1 tbsp bacon drippings or cooking grease, 2 cups cornmeal or 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp sugar (optional), 1 large egg, 1 1/4 cups buttermilk, 6 tbsps unsalted butter (melted). Put the bacon drippings or grease in a 9 or 10-inch well seasoned cast iron skillet and put the skillet into the oven. Then preheat the oven to 400 degrees with the skillet inside. If you don't have an iron skillet, you can use an uncovered Dutch oven, or a metal cake pan. Whisk together all the dry ingredients (cornmeal, baking soda, salt, sugar if using) in a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the egg and buttermilk until combined, then mix that into the bowl of dry ingredients. Stir in the melted butter. When the oven is hot, take out the skillet (carefully). Add the cornbread batter and make sure it is evenly distributed in the skillet. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the edges are beginning to brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean. Let the bread rest for 10 to 30 minutes in the skillet before cutting it into wedges and serving.\nVENISON CHILI1 lb boneless cubed venison steak, 1 lb pork sausage, 1 chopped onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, c beans (drained and rinsed), 6-oz can tomato paste, hot pepper sauce, salt and pepper, 15-oz can cannelini beans (drained), 10-oz can diced tomatoes with chilies.\nPlace venison and pound pork sausage in a large skillet and cook, breaking with a wooden spoon as necessary, over medium heat until no longer pink. Drain grease and mix in onion, garlic and c beans and cook for about 3 minutes. Drain and mix in tomato paste and season with hot pepper sauce, salt and black pepper to taste. Pour in cannellini beans, and diced tomatoes with chilies. Pour all of this into a slow cooker, adding the venison-sausage mixture in with the tomato-bean mixture. Cook 8 to 10 hours on low or 5 hours on high. Serve with shredded Cheddar cheese.\nWENDY'S CHILI\nIn a large skillet brown 2 pounds of fresh ground beef. Drain off fat and put the beef in a 6 quart pot with 1 quart of tomato juice, one 15 ounce can of tomato puree, one 15 ounce can of drained red kidney beans, one 15 ounce can drained pinto beans, one large chopped onion, 1/2 cup diced celery, 1/4 cup diced green pepper, 1/4 cup chili powder, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 1/2 tsps garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. Cover and simmer for one hour, stirring often.\nINSTANT POT VEGGIE CHILI\n1 tbsp olive oil, 1 medium white or yellow onion (diced), 1 medium red bell pepper (diced), 4 cloves garlic (minced), 3–4 cups vegetable stock, 1 (15-oz) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, 1 (15-oz) can beans of your choice (rinsed and drained), 1 cup uncooked green or brown lentils (picked over and rinsed), 1 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp ground cumin, salt and freshly-cracked black pepper. Some extras that go great with this are diced avocado, chopped fresh cilantro, diced green or red onions, shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and/or crumbled corn tortilla chips.\nPress the \"Sauté\" button on the Instant Pot. Add oil, followed by the onion and red pepper. Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion has softened. Add garlic and sauté for 1 more minute, stirring occasionally. Press the \"Cancel\" button. Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl of the Instant Pot. Place the lid on and set to \"Sealing.\" Using the \"Manual\" button, cook the chili on high pressure for 12 minutes, followed by a quick release. Taste and season with salt and pepper (or any other additional seasonings) as needed. Serve immediately, piled high with all of your favorite toppings. Or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.\nIf you prefer to use a slow cooker, add all ingredients to the bowl of a slow cooker and stir briefly to combine. Cover and cook on high for 3-4 hours or on low for 6-8 hours, until the lentils are tender. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve immediately, piled high with all of your favorite toppings. Or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.\nOLD FASHIONED CHILI\n2 pounds 85% lean ground beef, 1 tbsp canola oil, 2 sweet onions (diced), 4 cloves garlic (sliced), 1 red pepper (diced), 1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes, 2 15-ounce cans dark red kidney beans (drained), 2 15-ounce cans pinto beans (drained), 2 tbsps dark chili powder, 1 tbsp cumin, 1 tsp ground chipotle pepper, ½ cup chicken stock, 2 tbsps smoked paprika, 1 11-ounce can tomato juice such as V8, salt and freshly ground black pepper, shredded cheese, sour cream, green onions.\nIn a large soup pot over medium-high heat, add the canola oil and ground beef. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Sear for about 10 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and red pepper, and sauté about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, beans, chili powder, cumin, chipotle powder, paprika, chicken stock and tomato juice; simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, green onion, tortilla chips or crackers. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Country Cooking: Just need a bowl of homemade soup\n\n January 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1098\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Schools were closed for three weeks — two weeks for holidays and one for snow.Just when schools are open once again and the normal schedules begin to be in place, the temperatures dive to freezing again and life slows down.\nOne thing is for sure, appetites have not slowed down, and cooks are scrambling for suggestions to make life easier and keep tummies full.\nWell let's go back to farm life. When the temperatures dropped, and the ice and snow fell, Mom always knew what to cook. After spending the day out in the cold freezing weather, we would arrive home to the kitchen windows steamed up, the warm heat of the kitchen falling on our cold faces and the smell of soup bubbling on the stove and bread baking in the oven.\nNot only were the warm biscuits good, but there would always be a plate of assorted crackers with sliced sharp cheese to enjoy.\nLet's get the soup pot or Dutch oven out.\nGREEN LIMA BEAN SOUP WITH DUMPLINGS\nSOUP: 1 piece salt pork or ham bone, 1 can whole tomatoes, 6 cups water, 3 cups green lima beans, 1 cup corn, 3 small potatoes (peeled and cubed), 1 tbsp sugar, 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. DUMPLINGS: 2 cups flour, 1 tsp salt, 2 tsps oil, 2 tsps baking powder, water.\nIn the pot combine salt pork or ham bone with tomatoes, water, lima beans, corn, potatoes, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook slowly for about an hour and in the meantime mix your dumplings to add later. DUMPLINGS: mix flour with salt, oil, baking powder and enough water to moisten. Mix flour mixture well just adding enough water to make a stiff dough. Roll out on a floured surface and cut into two-inch pieces. When lima beans and potatoes are tender, add the dumplings to the soup, tasting the seasonings just before adding the dumplings. Cook until dumplings are tender and serve hot. NOTE: cook your seasoning meat before you start adding any beans, etc. unless you have leftover cooked ham or pork. I always just pre-cook my seasoning meat for a fresher taste.\nCHICKEN NOODLE SOUP\n2-1/2 pounds bone-in chicken thighs, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tbsp canola oil, 1 large onion (chopped), 1 garlic clove (minced), 10 cups chicken broth, 4 celery ribs (chopped), 4 medium carrots (chopped), 2 bay leaves, 1 tsp minced fresh thyme or 1/4 tsp dried thyme, 3 cups egg noodles (about 8 ounces), 1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley, 1 tbsp lemon juice, salt and pepper.\nPat chicken dry with paper towels; sprinkle with salt and pepper. In a six-quart stockpot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken in batches, skin side down; cook until dark golden brown, 3-4 minutes. Remove chicken from pan; remove and discard skin. Discard all but 2 tbsps of drippings. Add onion to drippings; cook and stir over medium-high heat until tender, 4-5 minutes. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Add broth, stirring to loosen browned bits from the pan. Bring to a boil. Return chicken to pan. Add celery, carrots, bay leaves and thyme. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, until chicken is tender, 25-30 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate. Remove soup from heat. Add noodles; let stand, covered, until noodles are tender, 20-22 minutes. Meanwhile, when chicken is cool enough to handle, remove meat from bones; discard bones. Shred meat into bite-sized pieces. Return meat to the stockpot. Stir in parsley and lemon juice. If desired, adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper. Discard bay leaves. Once they reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees, set the chicken on a plate, let cool and shred.\nEASY BEEF SOUP\n1/2 pound ground beef, 2 cups water, 1 can (14-1/2 oz) stewed tomatoes, 1 package (10 oz) frozen mixed vegetables, 1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce, 1 envelope onion soup mix, 1/2 tsp sugar.\nIn a saucepan over medium heat, cook beef until no longer pink, 3-5 minutes, breaking into crumbles; drain. Add the remaining ingredients; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until vegetables are tender about 10-15 minutes.\nCHEDDAR POTATO SOUP\n2 cups water, 2 cups diced unpeeled red potatoes, 1 cup diced carrot, 1/2 cup diced celery, 1/4 cup chopped onion, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, 2 cups 2% milk, 2 cups shredded reduced-fat cheddar cheese, 1 cup cubed fully cooked ham.\nIn a Dutch oven, combine the first seven ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 10-12 minutes or until tender. Place flour in a large saucepan; gradually whisk in milk. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat. Add cheese; stir until melted. Stir the ham and the cheese sauce into undrained vegetables; stir until combined.\nTURKEY AND WILD RICE SOUP\n1/2 cup uncooked wild rice, 4 cups water, 1/2 cup butter (cubed), 8 oz chopped red potatoes (about 2 medium), 1 medium onion chopped, 1 celery rib chopped, 1 medium carrot chopped, 2 garlic cloves minced, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 3 cups chicken broth, 2 cups half-and-half cream, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp dried rosemary (crushed), 2 cups cubed cooked turkey or chicken.\nIn a saucepan, combine rice and water; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat; simmer covered, 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven, heat butter over medium heat. Add potatoes, onion, celery and carrot; cook and stir for 6-8 minutes or until almost tender. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Stir in flour until blended; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Gradually stir in broth and undrained rice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; cook and stir 1-2 minutes or until slightly thickened. Add cream, salt and rosemary; return to a boil. Simmer, uncovered, 15-20 minutes or until rice is tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in turkey; heat through.\nSTUFFED PEPPER SOUP\n2 pounds ground beef, 6 cups water, 1 can (28 oz) tomato sauce, 1 can (28 oz) diced tomatoes (undrained), 2 cups chopped green peppers, 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, 2 tsps salt, 2 tsps beef bouillon granules, 1 tsp pepper, 2 cups cooked long grain rice, chopped fresh parsley.\nIn a Dutch oven over medium heat, cook and stir beef until no longer pink, breaking it into crumbles; drain. Stir in the next eight ingredients; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, until peppers are tender, about 30 minutes. Add cooked rice; simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes longer. If desired, sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley. The skin of bell peppers is thin and easily digestible; peeling them is very rarely required. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But what is love?Is it merely an emotion, a feeling, a hormonal reaction, or does it include a choice? Sure, there is chemistry involved in the initial attraction that brings two people together. But is that all there is to love or is there more?\nThe Bible explains that there is more to love than emotional or physical attraction. Love, true love, is a commitment, a choice, a willingness to put the interest of another above our own. According to 1 Corinthians 13:\n\"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.\" (1 Corinthians 13:4-8)\nWhy not take a few moments this February to evaluate the health of your love? Put your name in the place of the word \"love\" in this passage and ask yourself, \"am I patient? am I kind?\"\nCan you say with a straight face that you are not selfish, or rude or easily angered, and that you keep no record of wrongs?\nAnd then, based on your self-evaluation, commit to improving your love life in 2025. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This shift is called having the mind of Christ . . .\nWho, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross! (Philippians 2:5-8).\nAs we shift from celebrating the birth of Christ to commemorating the example of His life, death and resurrection, let us also shift our self-centered tendencies towards others by prioritizing their needs and well-being.\nWe can do this by lending a helping hand, offering a listening ear, including someone who feels left out, volunteering time or donating resources to a worthy cause, and by essentially putting others first in our decision-making and actions.\nWhat a different world this would be if in our relationships with one another we had the mind of Christ by doing \"nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. But rather, in humility valuing others above ourselves, not looking to our own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.\" (Philippians 2:3-4) \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is very interesting to consider what people seem most passionate about.Everyone seems to be passionate about something.\nAs Christians, we are passionate about many things — God, family, rights, the list can go on and on. But how many of us Christians (followers of Christ) are passionate about Jesus' last words before ascending to Heaven?\nMark 16:15 — And He said to them, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.\"\nThere are so many Christians today passionate about politics, conspiracies, health, theology, but not many are passionate about Christ's last words.\nWe need to on guard so that we do not become better at winning arguments, than at winning souls. God have mercy on us and forgive us of this great neglect. Give us ears to hear and hearts to receive and obey your word to us.\n2 Timothy 4:2. — Preach the Gospel in season, and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine.

In the same way, sitting in church doesn't make you a Christian.A Christian isn't someone who goes to church. This church is a place for us to gather; to praise and worship God; to learn about Jesus, His teachings and how we can apply these to our own lives. With that in mind, a Christian is someone who walks and talks the way of Jesus not just in church, but anywhere and everywhere.\nIn Matthew 25, verses 34-40, Jesus teaches us how we should treat the hungry, the thirsty, the destitute, the sick and the imprisoned, saying \"What you do for the least of these, you do for Me.\"\nHe didn't specify that this should be done for fellow Hebrews, or just His followers. My friends, whatever we do for the poor, the downtrodden, the helpless, the homeless, the oppressed, the imprisoned, the stranger, we do for Jesus. He also made it clear that what we don't do for those in need, we don't do for Him.\nI believe all of us will do whatever we can to help those in need. When they come to us, we are ready to assist in any way we can. Better yet, let's make the effort to seek them out. Jesus did that, too.\nJohn Wesley made it easy to remember, saying, \"Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, for as long as you can.\"\nAfter all, we're doing it to Jesus. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Today I would like to mention some of the things that happen.First, if a person is in Christ, he or she does not enjoy sin any more. If we love Him, we will remember that our sin is crucifying Him afresh, and then we just simply can't enjoy that sin. Yes when our Lord and Savior comes into our hearts we lose our pleasure in sin.\nSecondly when a person is truly saved (born again — John 3:3) he loves the gospel of Jesus Christ. One lady stated, \"I never do get tired of hearing you proclaim Jesus as Savior.\" It ought to be that way with every Christian.\nThirdly, if a person is in Christ, he loves to see others saved. A genuine Christian remembers that once he was lost, and he remembers the joy that came to him when he was saved. Now he wants others to have the same joy. The born-again person feels a burden for lost souls. He rejoices when others are saved.\nFourth, if a person is in Christ, he has a different attitude toward all others. A proof of a genuine follower of Christ is that a Christian must love all people. This is proof of his salvation. \"By this shall men know that ye are my disciple, because ye have love one for another.\"\nAnother piece of evidence of a person who is truly born-again — he truly lives for two worlds. The person who is truly saved sees that the things of this world do not count. His life becomes one of giving living, always wanting to do for others in the name of Christ. Every bit of service rendered, every dollar contributed means that you are laying up treasure in heaven.\nJesus changed my life over 50 years ago. Yes, when He comes into one's life all things become new. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Country Cooking: Time-saving recipes for Daylight Savings Time\n\n March 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1277\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Daylight savings time begins Sunday, March 9. Set those clocks forward one hour before going to bed on Saturday evening.Daylight Savings first started in Germany in 1916 to save energy during World War I. The United States started this change in 1918, but this was repealed after only one year. Then the United States reinstated this practice in 1942 and called it \"War Time.\"\nThe point behind Daylight Savings Time was to move an hour of sunlight from the early morning to the evening so people could make more use of daylight\nNo matter if you like the change or not — it is here. Personally, I like and dislike it. Having more time after dinner (supper) to be outside doing chores and yard work with the family is great, but getting small children in bed with daylight is difficult.\nWhat about dinner? It takes a lot of planning ahead with the dinner/supper hour. When the family hits the door, you hear \"what to eat?\" Everyone is starving, and Mom must be prepared.\nToday we will share some quick but filling meals, some pop in the oven casseroles, soups and sandwiches. Please share some of your favorites by emailing me at mmsavage21145@gmail.com so I can share some favorites from other households.\nBROCCOLI CHEESE CASSEROLE\nLarge bunch broccoli, 2 cups chopped sharp cheddar cheese, 2 eggs (lightly beated), 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 cup chopped onions, 4 tbsps softened butter, 1 1/2 cups herbed seasoned stuffing mix.\nRinse and steam broccoli until slightly tender. Grease a 11-by-7-inch casserole dish and arrange broccoli in the dish. Sprinkle cheddar cheese on top and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a bowl combine eggs with cream of mushroom soup, mayonnaise and chopped onions. Mix well and spread over cheese. Combine softened butter with herbed seasoned stuffing mix and place on top of broccoli mixture in a casserole. Bake for 30 minutes.\nBISHOPVILLE SQUASH CASSEROLE\n2 eggs, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese (divided), 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1-pound yellow summer squash (cut into 1/4-inch slices), 1/4 cup plain breadcrumbs.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish with cooking spray; set aside. In a large bowl, with a fork, beat eggs and sugar until frothy. Add 1 cup cheese, mayonnaise, salt and pepper; mix well. Stir in squash and pour mixture into prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs and bake for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, top with remaining cheese, and bake for 10 to 15 additional minutes, until heated through and the cheese is golden.\nCOUNTRY BEAN SUPPER\nThis is a very hearty combination of different types of beans combined with your choice of hamburger such as turkey or bison or the healthy 90/10 beef. This recipe is easy to make, very filling and simply add a roll to complete the meal. Perfect for a busy day dinner, Saturday lunch or hungry teens.\n1 lb beef, 1 cup diced onion, 1/4 cup fried bacon, 45-oz can pork and beans, 15-oz can kidney beans (drained), 15-oz can butter beans (drained), 15-oz can cannellini beans (undrained), 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 tbsp vinegar, 2 tbsps water, 1 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tbsp liquid smoke.\nBrown beef with diced onion until well-cooked then drain. In a crockpot place the beef and onion mixture with fried bacon, drained and broken into pieces, pork and beans, one 15 kidney beans, butter beans, cannellini beans, salt, pepper, vinegar, water, ketchup, brown sugar and liquid smoke. Mix slightly, place lid on crock pot, turn on low heat and cook for 4 to 6 hours. Serve with rolls.\nPOTATO SOUP\n4 cups peeled and cubed potatoes, 1 cup diced celery, 1 cup coarsely chopped onion, 2 to 2 1/2 cups water, 2 tsps salt, 3 tbsps butter or margarine, 1 tbsp dried parsley flakes, black pepper, 1 cup milk, 1 cup whipping cream.\nCook potatoes in a soup pot with celery, chopped onion, water, salt, butter or margarine, dried parsley flakes and black pepper to taste. Cook until potatoes, celery and onions are tender then mix in milk and whipping cream, stirring constantly until soup is thickened. Serve immediately.\nCROCK POT BEEF ROAST\n2-to-3-pound beef roast with fat on the bottom, 1 qt beef flavored stock, salt, black pepper, peeled potatoes (quartered), carrots (unpeeled), several onions (quartered)\nSpray the bottom of a crockpot and turn on high to heat the oil. In the meantime, rinse the roast with cool water, drain, and place in the crock with a fat side on the bottom. Pour beef flavored stock juice from a quart container — any brand — reserving the rest. Sprinkle the top of the roast with light salt and black pepper. Place the lid on top and continue cooking. Peel several potatoes, cut them in quarters and place in a bowl of cool water. Add several unpeeled carrots to the water, chopping them into quarters, unless you use the small carrots. Peel several onions, chop them into quarters. Drain water from veggies, place them in a crockpot around the roast. Add more liquid only if needed. Do not cover roast with liquid. Reserve the remaining beef stock. Place lid on, turn to medium heat and cook until beef and veggies are tender. You may need to add additional seasonings — after about 70 — 80 minutes cooking I drop a couple of brown gravy seasoning liquid drops in the stock for further seasoning, continue to cook until tender. Before adding any additional seasoning, taste test to see if it is necessary. When beef and veggies are tender, remove from the juice, in a casserole dish place veggies around the beef, adding a small amount of juice, about 1/2 inch. Cover tightly, save remaining juice to add some dumplings or a thickened brown gravy.\nHow about breakfast for dinner? Here are a few for just the occasion.\nSLOW COOKER CINNAMON ROLL CASSEROLE\nCooking spray, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 2 (16.3-oz.) cans refrigerated southern homestyle biscuits (such as Pillsbury Grands! Southern Homestyle) separated and cut into fourths, 1/2 cup plus salted butter (melted), 2 tbsps salted butter (softened), 4 large eggs, 1/4 tsp kosher salt, 2/3 cup plus 2 to 3 tbsps half-and-half (divided), 2 tsps vanilla extract (divided), 1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans,1 (3-oz.) package of cream cheese (softened), 2 1/4 cups (about 9 oz.) powdered sugar (divided).\nLine bottom and sides of a six-quart slow cooker with aluminum foil; lightly coat foil with cooking spray. Stir together granulated sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Toss together biscuit pieces and 1/2 cup melted butter in a large bowl until biscuits are coated. Working in batches, add biscuits to granulated sugar mixture, and toss to coat; transfer biscuits to prepared slow cooker. Sprinkle any remaining sugar mixture over biscuits in a slow cooker.\nPANCAKE CASSEROLE\nCooking spray, Pancakes, 6 large eggs, 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, 1 cup whole milk, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 tsp vanilla bean paste, 1/4 tsp kosher salt, unsalted butter, maple syrup.\nLightly coat a 13-by-9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Arrange pancakes in a baking dish in three rows, overlapping slightly, starting at one long end. Whisk together eggs, cream, milk, sugar, vanilla and salt in a bowl. Slowly pour mixture over pancakes. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake the casserole, covered, in a preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until the center is set, about 25 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes. Dot with pats of butter. Drizzle with syrup. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

GEDMAN St. Luke’s GMC | Section: News \n \n 332\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Lenten season begins today, a day called Ash Wednesday.Ashes are a sign of mortality and repentance. The uses of ashes dates back to ancient Jewish tradition and often were associated with sacrifices, mourning and fasting. A person would properly express grief, humiliation and repentance sitting in ashes or placing them on the head.\nAt one time, during the early centuries of the church, public penitents at Rome were ceremonially admitted on this day to begin their penance.\nThis ceremony fell into disuse between the eighth and 10th centuries as general penance of the entire congregation began to take place. This penance was symbolized through the imposition of ashes.\nAnother use for ashes in the early church (second century) included a regular ceremony of public confession and penance. This use had acquired so much significance that Tertullian (a prolific early Christian author from Carthage in the Roman province of Africa) spoke of \"the substitution of sackcloth and ashes for a man's usual habit.\"\nToday, ashes symbolize the same meanings though the ceremonial customs have vanished. The one exception to this is Ash Wednesday.\nThe word \"Lent\" derives from the anglo-saxon term lencten, meaning \"spring.\" During this time we earnestly recount all that God accomplished through the work of Jesus Christ.\nWe experience this period every year in the life of the church, but often, we forget, or sometimes we never knew what this time of year is about. Lent as a forty-day period of focus on penitence and preparation for the Resurrection Event of Easter. Today, we tend to observe Lent as a time of penance, by abstaining from festivals, by almsgiving, and by devoting more than the usual time to exercises of the faith. In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on these aspects than the physical fasting that marked this season in the early church.\nI pray that this Lenten season would be a holy and sacred time of preparation for the celebration of the greatest day in human history; the resurrection of Jesus Christ. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Nichols Denton Church of the Seventh-day Adventists | Section: News \n \n 238\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Wherever we live, work or interact with others within or across communities, all of us benefit and are affected to one extent or another in sharing and collectively seeking solutions.We need each other to be engaged in building, improving, expanding, making our communities, making centers that are safe, friendly, economically stable, prosperous, spiritually uplifting, culturally welcoming, diverse and nurturing because this is indeed, our community our village.\nThe Bible supports the idea of the ancient African proverb, \"It takes a village to raise a child.\" The future of our community, as well as the future generations of communities, will only be as strong as the community we create by working together. I want to encourage you to find ways to get involved in your community (village). You will grow and the village will be blessed.\nToday, we are often influenced by external suggestions and realities.\nSocial media, personal devices, broadcastings from numerous sources., and from others promoting and soliciting our support are bombarding our isolation, our values, our \"joining\" or \"acceptance\" endlessly.\nJust remember, Jeremiah 10:23, informs and cautions us that it is not in us as humans in isolation nor under the influence of others to \"direct\" our ways. We can always turn to God's Word and enhance our abilities to participate within and across our communities in responsible, just ways that will position our contributions to work together with others to the benefit of all and meet God's approval. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It brings with it a new birth and freshness we all seem to need after this winter's cold and snow.The days get longer, the temperature rises, the tulips break through the earth, singing a song of praise, the soil is being prepared for the planting of fresh crops. New life is unfolding before us each day. There seems to be joy and a sigh of relief that says moving forward.\nThis is also the Lenten season, where we as Christians remember and observe the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert before his ministry began. He was challenged and tempted by Satan but endured it all so he could be Our Lord, Our God of all.\nThis is a special and hollowed time leading to Resurrection Sunday. We prepare our hearts through prayer and fasting to celebrate the victory given to all mankind at the blood-stained cross of Calvary.\nKing David prayed in Psalm 51 that the Lord would purge and wash him, to blot out his sin and renew a right spirit within him. This should be the daily prayer and cry from all mankind, especially during the Lenten season.\nLord make me, make us pure, clean and Holy in your sight. We are all children of God created in his wonderful image, called to sing and show forth his praises and glory.\nWe occupy a world that is torn and broken by the hands and minds of man. Because of this our families, communities and even our churches are experiencing brokenness and collapse. Fear not, I can assure you today that we serve a God who is over it all and will get the Glory. Praise God.\nAs we seek his face, seek his wisdom, repent and turn from every weight and besetting sin, we will see his hand and power during this Lenten season. Just make it all about Jesus, the one who can fix it, the one who is faithful and true. This only comes through prayer and fasting.\nAll our need, the Lord will supply. Help us, Lord Jesus, during this Lenten season to acknowledge you and receive you afresh and anew. God's blessings upon you all. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Easton parade welcomes home Vietnam vets 50 years after end of war\n\n March 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 640\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Kenley Timms struggled to hold back tears after Sunday's Welcome Home parade for Vietnam veterans.Timms, commander of Easton VFW Post 5118 and a Vietnam veteran, had high hopes for the parade, stocked full of veterans, families and local service organizations.\n\"But our concerns were there was not going to be anybody,\" said an emotional Timms in front of more than 100 people at the post-parade ceremony held at the VFW post.\n\"I didn't know we were going to have people from the town show up, and it was quite obvious they did. Thank you.\"\nPeople lined the streets of Easton Sunday as the parade made its way down Washington Street and Glebe Road. Vietnam veterans from Easton, Talbot County and the entire Mid-Shore were honored for their service 50 years after the war's end.\nThose young, old and in between waved American flags and saluted veterans of the Vietnam War and families of those who gave their lives serving the nation in the conflict.\nIt was a welcome home that many never received.\nFollowing the end of the war in 1975, many soldiers weren't welcomed back with open arms, but with hostility. The war and its brutal nature divided the country and became increasingly unpopular as it went on.\n\"Time has a way of softening the edges and revealing truths,\" said Joe Cicchillo, commander of the Maryland VFW. \"The nation has come to see what you've always known. That you are — the veterans of Vietnam — our heroes. You served not because it was easy, because it was your duty.\"\nMike Detmer, a Dorchester County Councilman and Marine Corps veteran, said when he returned from his time in Iraq, Vietnam veterans gave his unit the welcome back they were never afforded.\n\"The warmest reception that I got was oftentimes from men and women that had those Vietnam campaign ribbon colors on their hats,\" Detmer said. \"And more than one of them told me that they wanted to ensure that we got welcomed back in the way that was appropriate.\"\n\"You're our treasure,\" Detmer said of Vietnam-era veterans. \"You're a treasure to this country.\"\nDuring the ceremony inside VFW Post 5118, Vietnam veterans and their families were honored, as were those who never returned home.\nTalbot County First Class Deputy John Coleman led the crowd in singing the national anthem and \"God Bless America.\"\nNgung Van Le, a former Vietnamese commando who worked for the CIA and a special United States intelligence operation during the war, was honored during the ceremony, receiving a standing ovation from the entire crowd.\nThe post held a solemn roundtable ceremony, with five veterans surrounding a table that symbolized those who were killed in action or became prisoners of war.\nCicchillo lauded the Vietnam veterans in attendance for their service during the war and their strength afterward.\n\"Vietnam was not just a war that was fought overseas,\" he said. \"It was a war that followed you back. When you returned, you didn't always get the welcome you deserved. Some of you faced silence, some of you faced scorn. And yet through it all, you held your head high.\n\"You knew all along of what you've done. You knew the sacrifices you made. You knew that freedom is not free, and it is paid for in sweat, blood and quiet moments of resilience that no one sees.\"\nTimms said the mission moving forward is to ensure the country's treatment of Vietnam vets upon their return after the war never repeats itself.\n\"We have members in this post that were spit on,\" Timms said. \"They were told when they hit the United States before they got off of that plane, make sure you do not go out in your uniform. That's disgraceful.\n\"We hope we'll never, ever see that again. As Vietnam veterans, we're going to support every unit, every army, navy, every veteran we can to make sure that never, ever happens again.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As a member of the United States Naval Academy Class of 1968, the ceremony was particularly significant for him in losing classmates to the war.\nTo this day, remains from those missing in action continue to be identified and brought home, he said, and for some, the war never truly ended as some families are kept waiting. Sikes said he himself never heard a thank you for his service until well into the 1980s and seeks to connect the community, especially the younger generation to remember the battles fought and the sacrifices made in duty in Vietnam.\nAlongside music performed by the Centreville Middle School Symphonic Band, a pin ceremony honored all members who served in active duty anywhere in the world from 1955 to 1975.\nMarch 29 was established as National Vietnam Veterans Day in 2017 and local ceremonies are crucial in continually providing recognition to noble service members, according to Farley.\nNavy veteran in Vietnam and organizer Dave Peterson led recognition of the five Queen Anne's County residents who died in the Vietnam operating theater and their Gold Star families.\nThe ceremony's Presentation of Colors was performed by the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps Maryland Division. The National Anthem was presented by the Quee Anne's County High School Chorus.\nTaps was performed by Stephanie Shields.\nPrayer was led by Rev. Reginald Ryans.\nParticipants and sponsors also included Centreville Veterans Information Center (CVIC), Veteran and Military Support Alliance (VAMSA), American Legion Jeff Davis Post 18 and Compass Regional Hospice. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Strawberry patches, fields, recipes and memories\n\n May 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1424\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When I was standing at my kitchen sink this afternoon washing, capping and slicing several small baskets of freshly picked strawberries, I had flashback memories of Mom doing this chore many years ago.The only difference was Mom had a large strawberry patch at one side of our garden, and my berries came from the local market.\nEarly in their farm life, my parents had a large strawberry field with workers who picked and drove the berries to a small packing house in town. Immediately, the berries got shipped to the large city markets. A lot of work was involved — from the day the plants were put in the ground, to the care and watering to the actual picking days.\nIn the meantime, let's go back to the kitchen, where our berries were being prepared for canning, freezing and the recipes the family loved. That large bowl of fresh \"sugared down\" strawberries that appeared at the dinner table was soon eaten.\nOnce again, the canning jars were carefully washed and waiting for that strawberry jelly and jam. The freezer was rearranged to make room for the frozen berries to eventually be used for pies, cakes and much more.\nTwo of my favorite strawberry memories are the old-fashioned homemade strawberry ice cream and strawberry shortcake.\nEnjoy today's recipes.\nSTRAWBERRY JAM\n5 cups crushed fresh strawberries (you'll need approximately 8 cups fresh strawberries or approximately 4 16-oz. containers), 7 cups granulated sugar, 1 packet original Sure-Jell premium fruit pectin powder, 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 tsp butter.\nWash jars, lids and bands in hot soapy water, dry completely, and set bands aside. Simmer lids in warm water in a saucepan until ready to place them on jars. Keep jars warm by simmering in hot water until ready to use. Do not boil. Fill a 20 quart stock pot or water bath canner with hot water, and place on the stove over medium-high heat (you'll need enough water to later cover your jars with at least 1 inch of water). Crush strawberries in a large mixing bowl or shallow glass baking dish using hand masher until nice, smooth consistency (small chunks are okay). Transfer crushed strawberries to 8 quart stock pot. Add pectin, lemon juice and butter to the pot, and stir constantly with a wooden spoon over high heat, while bringing to a rolling boil. Once boiling, add sugar, return to rolling boil, then boil for 1 minute while stirring constantly. After 1 minute, remove foam from top of jam by skimming it off with a metal spoon.one by one, remove a jar from hot water, transfer to a cookie sheet (this will catch any spills), place regular mouth canning funnel on jar, and ladle in strawberry jam mixture leaving 1/4 inch empty head space at top of the jar. Then wipe off the rim of the lid and threads of the jar with damp cloth.\nContinue until all jars have been filled. Remove warm lids from the saucepan, a magnetic lid lifter works like a charm, and place one lid on each jar. Then screw one band on each jar just until snug but not overly tight. Place filled jars on a rack in a 20 quart stock pot or water bath canner, then lower down into hot water. Make sure there is enough water in the pot that there is at least 1 inch of water above the jars. If necessary, add more hot water. Place the lid on your pot, and bring to a gentle boil. Once water is boiling, set your timer for processing and boil for 10 minutes, once jars have finished boiling, turn off heat, remove the lid from the pot and let jars sit for 5 minutes before removing. After 5 minutes, lift up the rack to an elevated resting position, then carefully remove jars one by one using a jar lifter, and transfer to a folded towel to cool. The lids on the jars will begin to 'pop' into the sealed position, signifying the jam has been preserved. If any lids do not pop within the first 12 — 24 hours, transfer those to the refrigerator and use those up first. It may take up to 24-48 hours to finish setting.\nJars can be stored in your pantry, or a cool, dry cupboard for up to 1 year. Label the top of each lid with the type of jam and the date it was made. Remove bands when storing and be sure to never stack jars on top of each other. Always inspect lids to ensure the seals are good before using. When ready to use, transfer a jar to your refrigerator, and use within 1 month.\nSTRAWBERRY PIE\n1 1/2 cups water, 1 cup granulated sugar, 3 tbsps cornstarch, 1 3-oz package strawberry Jell-O, 1 1/2 pints fresh capped strawberries, 8-inch pre-baked pie shell.\nMix together water, granulated sugar and cornstarch. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until thick. Remove from heat and Jell-O; mix in well and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes; then fold strawberries. Pour into pie shell. Refrigerate until firm. Serve with a cool whip on the top. You may also use a graham cracker crust.\nSTRAWBERRY RHUBARB PIE\n1 cup + 2 tbsps granulated sugar, 6 tbsps cornstarch, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 pound fresh rhubarb, 1 pound strawberries (stemmed and quartered), 1 tbsp orange juice, 2 tsps orange zest, 2 tsps vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, 1 large egg, 2 tbsps turbinado sugar.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet on the center rack of the oven to preheat. Roll out one piece of dough on a floured surface into a 12-inch round, starting at the center and working your way out (sprinkle flour over the top of the dough if it's a bit too moist). Carefully lift the dough and place in a 9-inch pie pan (not deep dish); gently press against the sides of the pan. Trim excess overhanging dough at the edge of the pie plate. Stir together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a large bowl until evenly combined. Add the rhubarb, strawberries, orange juice, orange zest, and vanilla. Toss until evenly coated. Pour the fruit mixture into the pie crust. Roll out the other piece of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface. Cut into eight 1 1/2-inch-wide strips. Arrange 4 strips of dough in parallel rows on top of the filling. Working with one strip at a time, arrange the remaining 4 strips perpendicular to the first ones, weaving the strips over and under to form a lattice. Trim the ends of the strips and press them against the bottom crust. Press with a fork all around the edge of the pie crust to crimp. In a small bowl, whisk the egg and 1 tbsp of water with a fork. Brush the dough lightly with the egg wash and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Bake the pie until the filling is bubbly and thickened in the middle of the pie, 1 hour 20 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. (Cover the pie with foil if the crust is getting too dark after 45 minutes.) Allow the pie to cool to room temperature before slicing, about 4 hours.\nSTRAWBERRY BREAD\n2 quarts fresh strawberries, 4 beaten eggs, 3 cups all purpose flour, 2 cups sugar, 3 tsps cinnamon, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 1/4 cup cooking oil, 1 cup chopped nuts.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour two 9 inch loaf pans and set aside. Wash and cap and slice berries. Drain well and place in a medium bowl. Stir in eggs, flour, sugar, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, oil and nuts. Mix well, pour into prepared pans and bake one hour or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.\nSTRAWBERRY LEMONADE\n1 pound strawberries plus more to garnish, 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, 2 cups fresh lemon juice (strained and divided), ice, lemon slices to garnish.\nHull and quarter the strawberries. Place the strawberries in a large bowl, stir in the sugar and ¼ cup lemon juice. Allow to sit, covered for 30 minutes. In a countertop blender, blend the strawberry mixture until pureed. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve to get the seeds out. In a large bowl, combine the strawberry puree with the remaining 1 ¾ cups of lemon juice and 4 cups of water. Add up to 1 additional cup of water to taste if the mixture is too sweet or strong. To serve, stir the lemonade and pour it over ice. Garnish with sliced lemon and strawberries. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Jesus tried to show them that all people matter, even those who are lost and far from God.\nIn fact, God takes the initiative and does an all-out search, rescue and restoration mission for those who are lost. \"For the Son of Man came to seek and save those who are lost.\" (Lk 19:10; NLT)\nIt would not be strange for a sheep to be lost while out on the hillside. And it really would not be strange for a good shepherd to seek out the lost sheep. Jesus basically said, \"Wouldn't you all do the same thing?\"\nWhat would be strange would be for the shepherd or the woman who lost a valuable coin or a father to do nothing to seek and save that which was lost.\nAnd not only to seek and rescue but to restore that which was lost. The sheep's injuries were tended to and cared for. The coin was placed back into safe-keeping. The son was restored back to his position as son in the family.\nGod is on a mission to bring restoration back to people's lives. He wants to restore joy and peace and relationships. He wants to restore dignity. He wants to restore our significance and purpose. May all who are lost be found. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Are we waiting for a big, wooden one like Jesus carried?\nAs Christians, one of our goals is service to the church and to the community. It's easy to pick up something we're capable of. Maybe we have the skills, time and desire. We know we'll take joy in doing them. Yet, despite the time, money or sweat we put into it, this is not our cross.\nIf it's easy, and if we take joy in it, this is not our cross. Do you think Jesus took pleasure in carrying the cross He did? Was it easy?\nThe cross we are being asked to pick up and carry in His name will have the same weight as the one He carried. It will be just as cumbersome. So pick up your cross.\nOur cross will not be shaped like the cross that Jesus carried. It might be big or it might be small, but it will be heavy.\nThis is how we follow Jesus. We must step out of our comfort zones and go above and beyond what we think we're capable of. Doing the will of God becomes our cross to bear. So pick up your cross.\nJesus didn't want to carry His cross, but He did.

    "content": "Sheeba returns home: Easton community comes together to locate lost pit bull\n\n July 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 797\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — When Paul Traynor woke up last Thursday, he noticed a small beige dot on his back deck camera. It took a few moments, but he soon realized it wasn't just a speck. Sheeba was home.It had been eight days since Traynor's tan-and-white pit bull went missing, escaping out the front door on June 18. Traynor was on vacation in Ireland for his 60th birthday at the time — the \"last place\" he wanted to be when a pet sitter informed him Sheeba was nowhere to be found.\nOver the next week, neighbors, residents across Easton and locals with dog-searching expertise endeavored to track Sheeba and bring her back home. It was an overwhelming week for Traynor and his granddaughter, Jocilyn, as they spread the word on social media, kept tabs with family and volunteers, and arranged a flight back to the United States.\nLast Thursday morning, Traynor reunited with Sheeba. She found her way back home after an eight-day trek that, in many ways, brought together an entire community.\nOn Saturday, Traynor sat on his back deck sporting a new faded green baseball cap labeled \"Dog Dad.\" He and his granddaughter recounted the whirlwind of a week while the pit bull walked by intermittently for some love and affection. In some ways, it's still an unbelievably happy ending that his beloved Sheeba returned home.\n\"I was floored, and still am, that she was out here,\" Traynor said.\nTRACKING SHEEBA\nShy but approachable, Sheeba is around 7 years old and has been with Traynor for four years. He fostered her as an abuse rescue from Talbot Humane after she was found in St. Michaels. He decided to keep her for good.\nAs word spread on social media that Sheeba went missing, volunteers with experience in tracking lost pets tried to hone in on effective search methods. Local drone photographers chipped in, too, such as Bart Ferguson of Chesapeake Aerial Solutions.\nThe community's efforts spanned from Facebook posts with hundreds of engagements to posters being placed in the nearby area. When Traynor returned from Ireland, he said it seemed like every other person he encountered knew of Sheeba.\n\"Half of Easton was looking for this dog,\" Traynor said.\nInge Peters leads a nonprofit cat rescue shelter in Stevensville and also helps out with lost pet searches in Maryland and surrounding states.\n\"A lost pet being lost can go wrong so fast,\" Peters said.\nPeters and local searcher Sam Happekotte spent hours tracking Sheeba sightings from residents and the potential paths the dog took, most commonly roads or clearings. Peters advises that owners of lost dogs remain calm if they can locate their furry friend. Yelling their name or chasing them only increases the risk they turn around or dangerously run into a nearby road, she said.\n\"Talk to them the way you do inside, the way you do every single day,\" Peters said.\nThe first sighting of Sheeba came on a Thursday, the day after she went missing from Traynor's home in a neighborhood east of Route 50. Sheeba likely traveled east down Dover Road and was spotted near Dover and Chilcutt Roads.\nBut it wasn't until the following Sunday that a second sighting was reported — news that Jocilyn Traynor says was energizing after a \"really tough\" quiet spell.\nSheeba strayed further from home toward North Dover Road, and one resident even noted they potentially heard her barking. Paul Traynor says Sheeba has rarely, if ever, barked in the four years he's had her.\n\"That just shows that in that mode, in that survival mode, they're different,\" Peters said of lost dogs.\nSheeba then traveled north to Matthewstown Road, according to multiple sightings, before turning around, potentially crossing Dover Road and making her way home.\nTraynor said between the tireless work, heat-sensor drones and other strategies implemented to track Sheeba's whereabouts, he was in shock about how much effort went into bringing her home safely.\nTraynor shared many thanks for those who searched far and wide for Sheeba, from the drone photographers, to the everyday residents to his adult daughters, Kellie and Brooke. \"You people are amazing,\" he said.\nA video of Sheeba walking up to the back deck, approaching the Blink surveillance camera and then standing at the back door has gained over 400,000 views on Traynor's TikTok. In a way, Traynor said, she's become a local celebrity, bringing together a community in times of division.\nBy Saturday, Sheeba was healthy and spry, walking inside at times to avoid the midday heat. Despite spending eight days in extreme temperatures, she didn't have too many overwhelming health concerns or weight loss when the vet checked on her, Traynor said — an indication that she found shade, water and food to sustain herself.\n\"She might be timid, but she's not weak,\" he said. \"She's a tough little girl.\"\nThis story has been updated to clarify the date Sheeba returned home. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

GEDMAN St. Luke’s GMC, Denton | Section: Columns \n \n 340\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n What does God want from me?Without question, our belief in Jesus as the Christ is the prerequisite to everything else. Nevertheless, what does Christ want after our salvation?\nCertainly, He does not need anything from the physical world. After all, God is the provider of all things. But there is one thing we can offer: Time.\nTime is definable and measurable. It controls our lives, it marches on no matter what we do, and our days are limited. We sell it, give it away and waste it. The best we can do is to utilize our time efficiently and effectively. In our culture, time is precious commodity. God wants our time. Interestingly, time is the one thing may people claim not to have.\n\"They are too busy,\" they'll say. Well, as someone noted, the acronym BUSY means \"buried under Satan's yoke.\" Yep, too many times our being \"busy\" causes us to not spend time with God.\nJesus taught that we should \"seek first his kingdom.\" This requires time. Just as we prioritize bills and purchases, our time is prioritized, and God is not always at the top of the list. While this seems to be a part of our human condition, there is one solution I can offer, whereby you can begin to commit more of your time to God: weekly worship.\nPaul admonished us to \"not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing.\" Consider for a moment that we have 168 hours per week. An average worship service is one hour. By dividing 1 into 168, we see that Sunday worship consumes six-10ths of 1 percent (.6%) of our time.\nEven netting our time by a 40-hour work week, 56 hours for sleep and one hour preparation and travel time to church, only amounts to 1.4% of our time.\nIs God worth 1.4% of our time? Commit yourself to attending corporate worship once a week. God will bless your commitment, and you'll find that you want to spend more time with God in prayer and reading His Word, the Bible. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Less then two days after the tragic news was broken, business owners and residents rallied together to create meal trains and events in support of the Puckett family.\nThe community event Sunday was started by Victor Reynolds, head of communications for CASA of Caroline and Owner of Bayside Hotdogs.\n\"The event went amazing,\" Reynolds said. \"The amount of people that showed up was well more than I expected.\"\nWhile some vendors backed out of the event just hours before, Reynolds and over a dozen other businesses pulled together and held a community event filled with fun for kids and adults.\nReynolds said attendance exceeded hundreds. They received donations from neighboring states.\nAll proceeds, which were estimated at over $5,000, went to the Puckett Family. The family attended the event all day and brought tables to help set up early.\n\"To every vendor, volunteer, friend, family member, and supporter who came out for the Bentley and Mason Memorial, we are truly overwhelmed with gratitude,\" Father, Michael Puckett said in a Facebook post following the event.\nPuckett also thanked Reynolds for his help setting up the event.\n\"Just to let you know it was still a great turn out thanks to Victor,\" Puckett said in the Facebook post. \"That man is a God sent and he deserves everything for this. I can't thank Victor Reynolds enough.\n\"Your presence, your love, your donations, your time, and your kindness meant the world to us during such a heartbreaking time,\" the post continued. \"Seeing so many people come together in honor of Bentley and Mason was powerful beyond words. You helped turn a day of pain into a moment of remembrance, love, and unity!\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Our country has enjoyed not uncontested, but world-wide recognition for its leadership in governance by and for the people that other nations envy and aspire to practice.\nWe developed a system of laws over time that projected and protected a belief in God without heavy-handed government interference. Prescriptions for the rights of people to enjoy the practice of individual religious values and beliefs, as dictated by their conscience, was a founding attraction and driving force for braving the hazards of cross-continental search and relocation of peoples of oppression and discrimination.\nA driving force in the development of early colonial, regional and states rights for economic opportunities and welcome to diverse groups of people greatly benefited our growing national wealth and character. Equality and opportunity were precious cornerstones.\nRespect for developing a government where power was not to be centered in an individual or faction, but in a three-branch form of government whose functions were to serve as a check on the powers of each other branch was and has been a hallmark of the USA. Government was developed to be a help to its citizenry and immigrants and not a terror.\nAs Christians in the USA and in other parts of the world, we must ever remember and never forget to lift our hands in recognition to God, our Creator and King. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.\"\nIn a world filled with uncertainty, Jesus offers a life-changing perspective: focus on God's kingdom first, and stop worrying about tomorrow.\nTo \"seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness\" means placing God's priorities ahead of our own. It is a daily choice to pursue His will, His ways, and His purposes. When we do this, Jesus promises that \"all these things\" — our basic needs of life — will be provided.\nJesus also addresses one of life's greatest challenges: worry about the future. He reminds us that tomorrow has its own problems and should not rob us of today's peace. Worry adds stress but accomplishes nothing. Faith, however, produces calm and confidence because it trusts God with what lies ahead.\nThree Practical Steps:\nStart with God each day — Begin mornings with prayer and Scripture, keeping your focus on His kingdom.Release tomorrow's concerns — Choose trust over anxiety; handle today's responsibilities, and let tomorrow rest with God.Rest in His care — Believe that as you prioritize Him, He will supply what you truly need.\nThe heart of Jesus' teaching is simple but powerful: when God is first, worry loses its grip. Today, choose to trust Him fully, live faithfully, and embrace His peace for today while leaving tomorrow in His hands. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Nowhere is that more true than in the Psalms.When I began the habit of daily praying through the Psalms, I quickly discovered that these ancient prayers put language to the full range of human experience.\nSome mornings I read words of joy and praise, \"Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous\" (Psalm 97), and I find my heart lifted in thanksgiving. Other mornings I encounter the raw honesty of lament, \"Awake! Why are you sleeping, O Lord?\" (Psalm 44), and I realize I am allowed to bring my questions and frustrations to God. Still other times I pray with the psalmist who feels abandoned, yet clings to hope by remembering God's mighty deeds (Psalm 77).\nWhat I appreciate most is that the Psalms refuse to settle for shallow faith. They teach us that real prayer is not polished or polite but honest and wholehearted. Whether we are rejoicing or grieving, praising or questioning, the Psalms remind us that God invites us to come as we are.\nAnd for Christians, praying the Psalms takes us one step further. These prayers ultimately point us to Jesus, the one who prayed them before us and for us. On the cross He took up the words of Psalm 22, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" so that we might learn to trust that God hears us in every season.\nDaily, the Psalms give us the words we need, and the God we need. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: What does God want from me?\n\n August 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: THE REV. DANIEL T. GEDMAN St. Luke’s GMC, Denton | Section: Columns \n \n 342\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n What does God want from me? Without question, our belief in Jesus as the Christ is the prerequisite to everything else. Nevertheless, what does Christ want after our salvation?Certainly, He does not need anything from the physical world. After all, God is the provider of all things. But there is one thing we can offer: time.\nTime is definable and measurable. It controls our lives, it marches on no matter what we do, and our days are limited. We sell it, give it away and waste it.\nThe best we can do is to utilize our time efficiently and effectively. In our culture, time is a precious commodity.\nGod wants our time. Interestingly, time is the one thing many people claim not to have. \"They are too busy,\" they'll say. Well, as someone noted, the acronym b.u.s.y. means \"buried under Satan's yoke.\" Yep, too many times our being \"busy\" causes us to not spend time with God.\nJesus taught that we should \"seek first his kingdom.\" This requires time.\nJust as we prioritize bills and purchases, our time is prioritized and God is not always at the top of the list. While this seems to be a part of our human condition, there is one solution I can offer, whereby you can begin to commit more of your time to God: weekly worship.\nPaul admonished us to \"not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing.\" Consider for a moment that we have 168 hours per week. An average worship service is one hour. By dividing 1 into 168, we see that Sunday worship consumes six tenths of one percent (.6%) of our time. Even netting our time by a forty-hour work week, 56 hours for sleep and one hour preparation and travel time to church, only amounts to 1.4% of our time. Is God worth 1.4% of our time?\nCommit yourself to attending corporate worship once a week. God will bless your commitment and you'll find that you want to spend more time with God in prayer and reading His Word, the Bible. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Enjoying the fall vegetables\n\n September 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1814\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It's that time of the year when summer is slowly slipping away and fall is approaching. All the signs are appearing — from the school bus to the pumpkins at the roadside stands.Growing up in the country, this time of year was usually when the potato baskets came out of storage. This meant that \"digging day\" was coming up. Mom would remind my sister and I that it would soon be storing food time. We had to scrub down the kitchen and the canning equipment after the summer harvest was processed and stored in the canning closet or the freezer.\nIt had been a long and busy summer both on the farm, in town, just about everywhere there is a kitchen and a family to feed. Even farmers, who made money selling crops, had to keep enough on hand to feed their families.\nNowadays, with the economy struggling, prices are going up on everything related to feeding the family. Families from all walks of life are preparing the food supply for winter months ahead. Makes you think of those families that survived times like the Great Depression.\nThis time of year in my family, most money went to school clothes or yards of fabric for clothes to be made at home. As always, we found joy in cooking or at mealtime. We never knew we were poor because so much thought and love was put into every piece of hand-stitched clothing or every plate of food on the table.\nLet's clean out those freezers and make room for the fall veggies. Besides stocking up on, and maybe freezing, the last of your summer produce, get ready for fall by picking up some fresh apples, basil, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, grapes, kale and potatoes.\nFall has always been my favorite season.\nBROCCOLI CHEDDAR CASSEROLE\n2 pounds broccoli (stems removed and crowns cut into florets), 2 strips thick-cut bacon cut crosswise into 1/4-inch strips, 5 large eggs (beaten), 1/3 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 cup whole milk, 2 to 3 tsps freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 2 tsps Dijon mustard, 8 oz cheddar cheese (grated).\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 tbsp salt for 2 quarts of water). Add the broccoli florets and boil for 3 to 5 minutes or until just tender enough so that a fork can easily pierce the floret. Strain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. While the water in step one is coming to a boil, cook the bacon pieces on medium heat in a frying pan until lightly browned, but not crisp. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess fat. Set aside. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Butter a 2.5-quart casserole dish or a foil pan. In a bowl, whisk the eggs into the flour, then whisk in the cream and milk. Add the black pepper (more or less to taste), salt, and mustard. Mix in about a third of the cheese. Place the blanched broccoli florets in the casserole dish, sprinkling about a third of the cheese over the broccoli florets as you lay them down. Sprinkle the bacon pieces over the broccoli. Pour the egg, cream, milk, cheese mixture over the broccoli, moving the broccoli pieces a bit so that the mixture gets into all the nooks and crannies. Sprinkle the casserole with the remaining cheese. Bake until the casserole is set, 25 to 40 minutes depending on the depth of the casserole dish. Once the top has browned, you may want to tent with aluminum foil to keep from burning.\nSHREDDED BRUSSELS SPROUTS AND KALE SALAD WITH APPLE, GORGONZOLA AND CANDIED PECANS\nFor the dressing: 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice, 1 garlic clove (minced), 1 tsp sugar, 1/8 tsp salt, fresh ground pepper to taste. For the salad: 1 pound Brussels sprouts (thinly shredded),1 bunch of kale (stems removed, and leaves finely chopped), 2 medium apples (cored and thinly sliced), 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/3 cup candied pecans (chopped), 1/4 cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese, 4 slices cooked chopped turkey bacon (optional).\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, sugar and salt. In a separate large bowl, toss together shredded brussels sprouts and kale mixture with your hands. Slowly pour in dressing and use your hands to massage the kale and brussels sprouts for about 5 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour or up to overnight to allow for dressing to soak into the kale and Brussels. Once ready to serve, toss in apple slices, dried cranberries and chopped candied pecans. If you'd like you can add in chopped bacon at this point and toss salad again. Finally, garnish with crumbled gorgonzola. Serve immediately. Season with freshly ground black pepper.\nEND OF SUMMER GRILLED VEGETABLES\n1 bell pepper cut into half-inch thick strips, 1 red onion cut into half-inch rounds or quarters, 1 zucchini cut into half-inch rounds, 1 yellow squash cut into half-inch rounds, 1/2 pound fingerling potatoes, 1/2 pound Brussels sprouts cut in half, 1/2 pound baby bella mushrooms, 2 ears corn (shucked and cleaned), 2 tbsps olive oil, freshly ground salt and pepper, 2 tsps garlic powder.\nPreheat your grill to medium or medium-high heat, which is about 375 to 400 degrees on a gas grill. Scrape off any leftover bits from the last time you grilled. Marinate your veggies or season them with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. For large veggies like corn, bell pepper, thicker sliced zucchini, eggplant and onion, and portobello mushrooms, I recommend slicing, seasoning and putting them directly on the grill so that they get those lovely grill marks. Place your oiled and seasoned vegetables on the grill in a single layer, starting with the ones that take the longest to cook in the back where your grill is likely the hottest and finishing with the quick cooking vegetables in the front. Close the lid and let the veggies cook for about 5 minutes. Flip your veggies, starting with the closer ones. Then replace the lid and let them cook a few minutes more or until done to your liking. This goes great with any main dish.\nROASTED VEGGIES WITH PARMESAN AND OLIVE OIL\n1 large butternut squash (seeded and cut into cubes), 1 pound Brussels sprouts (halved), 3 large carrots (peeled and sliced), 2 large parsnips (peeled sliced), 1 large red onion (coarsely chopped), 12 garlic cloves (peeled), 2 tbsps olive oil, 1 tbsp dried oregano, 1 tbsp dried rosemary, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, 1/2 tsp salt, freshly ground black pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Add veggies to a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, oregano, rosemary and garlic. Pour over veggies and toss to evenly distribute. Add in parmesan topping, salt and pepper and toss again until well coated. Pour on a baking sheet and spread out evenly. Roast in the oven for 35-45 minutes, stirring every 15-20 minutes, until squash is fork tender and sprouts are slightly crispy and caramelized.\nCOUNTRY STYLE BAKED SWEET POTATO CASSEROLE\n4 pounds baked sweet potatoes, ½ cup butter, ¼ cup light brown sugar, 2 ½ tsps salt, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla extract, ¾ cup chopped pecans, 3 cups mini marshmallows.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place the sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and bake for 1 hour, or until very fork tender. This can be done up to 3 days ahead. Refrigerate the baked sweet potatoes if making ahead. Change the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Set out a large mixing bowl. Peel the loose skins off the hot baked sweet potatoes. Place them in the bowl. Add the butter, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Use an electric mixer to beat the sweet potatoes into a smooth mash. Set out a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Scoop the sweet potato mash into the dish and spread it out in an even layer. Sprinkle the chopped pecans on top. Then sprinkle the mini marshmallows over the pecans in a single layer. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the marshmallows are golden and puffy. Serve warm.\nCABBAGE ROLLS\n1 head green cabbage, 1 cup uncooked rice, 1 pound ground pork, ½ pound ground beef, 2 small onions (diced), 3 cloves garlic (minced), ½ tsp dill, 3 tbsps fresh parsley (chopped), salt and pepper to taste, 1 can diced tomatoes (14 oz), 1 egg, 1 ½ cups plus ⅓ cup tomato sauce (divided), 1 can tomato soup (10.5 oz).\nBoil cabbage leaves for about 2 minutes or until soft. Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cook rice according to package directions but reduce cooking time by 5 minutes. Set aside. Cook pork, beef, onions, garlic and seasonings in a pan until no pink remains. Drain any fat. Add in rice, diced tomatoes and ⅓ cup of tomato sauce. Stir in egg. Mix remaining tomato sauce and tomato soup in a bowl. Spread a very thin layer of the tomato sauce mixture in a 9-by-13-inch pan. Remove thick stem on cabbage leaves. Lay the cabbage leaf flat and add ¼ to 1/3 cup filling to the center of the leaf. Fold in the sides and roll the cabbage up. Place seam side down in the pan. Repeat with remaining cabbage. Pour sauce over the cabbage and cover tightly with foil. Bake for 75-90 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes before serving.\nSUMMER VEGETABLE SOUP\n1 tbsp olive oil, 1 medium yellow onion (finely diced), 3 sprigs fresh rosemary, 3-4 cloves garlic (minced), 1/2 pound zucchini (sliced into half-moons), 1/2 pound summer squash (sliced into half-moons), 2 ears sweet corn (kernels removed), 1/2 pound green beans, 1/2 pound fresh tomatoes (diced), 1 pound red potatoes (cut into 1-inch cubes), 12 oz frozen lima beans, 15-oz can white beans (drained and rinsed), 7 cups vegetable broth, ¼ cup fresh chopped parsley plus more for topping, 1/2 tsp salt, ¼ tsp black pepper, 2 tbsps lemon juice.\nIn a large soup pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the diced onion and fresh rosemary sprigs. Sauté for 6-8 minutes, or until onion is translucent, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and sauté a minute more. Carefully remove rosemary sprigs. Add all vegetables: zucchini, squash, sweet corn kernels, green beans, tomatoes, frozen lima beans, red potatoes and white beans. Cover in vegetable broth. Stir in salt, pepper and fresh parsley. If extra liquid is needed to fully cover the vegetables, add ½ cup water at a time until vegetables are fully submerged. Cover with a lid. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, uncover and reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered until potato is softened, about 12-15 minutes. When the potatoes and vegetables are tender, stir in fresh lemon juice. Taste for salt and pepper. Serve topped with fresh parmesan and additional fresh chopped parsley. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Amen.Brothers and sisters in Christ, let not your hearts be troubled. Seems like difficult words to follow as we consider the events across our nation over the past several weeks.\nI mean, whose heart wouldn't be troubled by the news of the loss of life as a result of two school shootings, a stabbing on a train, and the assassination of a man for speaking with a voice of truth. Throw in the mix a bitter divorce, a cancer diagnosis, loss of employment, depression, and the list goes on and on.\nYet, in all these things, our Lord tells us to let not our hearts be troubled. But how can he do that?\nGod can do it because He is the God of justice, peace, grace, mercy and forgiveness. He takes upon Himself all the things that trouble our hearts and He carries them to the cross and there He dies for them, for you, for me. In His death, our troubled hearts are healed as His grace, in blood and water, flows from the cross and covers us. Jesus came as Immanuel, that is God with us, and became one of us. He too experienced what it meant to have a troubled heart. In doing so, He leads us where our troubled hearts are to be no more. That is to the cross, to His salvation for all of us. And to heaven, where troubled hearts exist no more.\nFriends, God loves you. He is with you even in times of troubled hearts. The devil, sin, and death do not get the last word or the final say. Jesus triumphs over all and from the cross, His cry of \"It is finished\" is the healing voice and balm for our troubled hearts. Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. Now and forever. Amen. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I've engaged in them all, and I value each for the lessons they teach. Losing, when it happens, can even make you stronger.In debate or sport, you must prepare. You must know your opponent's strengths and weaknesses, and you must have a strategy. And win or lose, you are judged not only by the outcome but by how you carry yourself. I learned long ago: You lose with honor, but you win with grace.\nSo I ask — where has grace gone? Where has decorum gone? Today it seems acceptable to shout down opponents, to sneer and label, to point fingers instead of making points. These are tactics we would scold in children, yet they are now common currency in our politics.\nI always valued the end of a contest, when you could shake hands, smile and respect the person across from you — even if you didn't like them. The best opponent was never the one I agreed with, but the one I could respect.\nThe true test of character, in debate or in life, is simple: Would I welcome this person as my next-door neighbor? Increasingly, I fear too many of today's loudest voices would fail that test.\nDAN McKEW\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Instead, they focus instead on fund raising, collecting dues, marketing services, lobbying and sending periodic news updates to their members.\nPutnam also drew a distinction between two different but equally important types of social capital.\nOne type is \"bonding\" which occurs within a homogenous demographic group.\nThe other type is \"bridging\" which unites people from different groups.\nPutnam concluded a lack of social capital undermines the active civic engagement that a strong democracy requires from its citizens.\nI now know my friend's visit was more than a get-together to talk over old times, catch up on current times and ponder on the future.\nIn all our discussions, including those with civil discourse on politics, we built social capital.\nIt was unexpected opportunity to think about and evaluate what I can be and should be doing to help address the lack of civil discourse and to help increase social capital in our society.\nThe answer is clear.\nGoing forward, I must consistently strive to:\nRespectively consider all points of view.Listen with more than waiting for my turn to talk.Say regularly \"you may be right.\"Limit discussions as debates.Disagree without being disagreeable.Always look for opportunities to build social capital. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton VFW delivers plaques to vets in nursing homes, living facilities\n\n October 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 670\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Easton VFW Post 5118 is embarking on an effort to honor local veterans in nursing homes and assisted living facilities ahead of Veterans Day.Wayne Dyott is commander of the post's chapter of the Military Order of the Cootie, an auxiliary of the national VFW that focuses on hospitalized veterans. He's spearheaded the project by placing plaques outside the doors of veterans in facilities like Bayleigh Chase on Dutchmans Lane in Easton.\nTed Cumings, a Green Beret who served 25 years in the U.S. Army including two stints in Vietnam, was one of more than 40 veterans to receive the first batch of plaques. Cumings moved into Bayleigh Chase in February.\nHe thanked Dyott for presenting the plaque to him, pointing out how much the act contrasts the harsh welcome home he received when he returned from war.\nVietnam veterans were greeted coldly by the American public, which had grown frustrated with the war. Some veterans experienced physical violence. Others were told to change out of their uniforms immediately upon landing on U.S. soil.\nDyott said the plaques were part of an effort to acknowledge and thank these veterans for their service.\n\"It means a lot,\" Cumings said. \"I always compare it to the greeting I got in 1968 coming home from my first Vietnam tour.\"\nDyott delivered plaques across the entire Bayleigh Chase retirement community this week, presenting them to veterans and placing them outside their doors. He hopes to spread the effort to other nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Easton.\nThe plaques read: \"An American patriot lives here\" and \"I proudly served our country!\"\nVFW Post 5118's Military Order of the Cootie chapter, called Pup Tent 6, includes around 30 members, Dyott said. They sport unique clothing, such as red socks and quirky caps, and the commander is typically referred to as the \"Seam Squirrel.\"\nThe group raises funds for veterans' hospitals and the VFW National Home in Michigan, a national nonprofit which provides housing and case management to veterans and their families. And locally, small actions to acknowledge the veterans living in hospitals or living facilities have a big impact, Dyott added.\n\"They can't always get out to the veterans' services and ceremonies,\" he said. \" … It's just a small way of recognizing them.\"\nDyott kicked off the project at Bayleigh Chase with the assistance of the Rev. Bill Ferris, chaplain at the facility. Ferris served as an Army chaplain in Iraq and an enlisted soldier during Hurricane Katrina.\nWhen Dyott came to him with the idea of honoring the veterans living in Bayleigh Chase, Ferris was ecstatic.\n\"I loved the idea,\" Ferris said. \"As a veteran myself, I'm wanting to support and honor our vets here.\"\nThe Bayleigh Chase facility has a tradition of honoring its veteran residents, such as during its annual Veterans Day ceremony. Ferris said last year more than 100 people total participated in the event.\n\"For this community, that was huge,\" he said. \"Because you can get some big crowds, 40 or 50, and that's normally what we might have for Christmas Eve or a memorial.\"\nCumings may be one of the new attendees to this year's Veterans Day events at Bayleigh Chase. The Michigan-born father of three served from 1960 to 1985, including the latter portion of his career as an advisor to Caspar Weinberger, the secretary of defense under President Ronald Reagan.\nAfter working as a defense contractor for 11 years, he moved to Rock Hall and enjoyed life on the Eastern Shore. In 2017, Cumings was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He has arthritis and peripheral neuropathy and lingering spinal injuries stemming back to his time in Vietnam.\nBut the Bayleigh Chase living facility has been the perfect landing spot, he said. Not only is it honoring him as a veteran, but staff have treated him and other residents with the utmost care, the former Army colonel said.\n\"I'm very glad I'm here,\" Cumings said. \"This place is absolutely outstanding. Staff who really, really care, who go the extra mile for us. Who smile for us. Who keep the place livable, clean, great food.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It was large in meaning.The plaques, prepared by Easton VFW Post 5118, were posted outside doors of veterans in the Bayleigh Chase retirement community this week. Wayne Dyott, commander of the post's chapter specializing in fundraising for hospitalized veterans, is leading an effort to honor local vets in nursing homes or living facilities.\nDyott explained to Cumings that he felt the plaques were a way to recognize veterans who may not always be able to attend public-facing veterans ceremonies or services. Cumings, a former U.S. Army colonel and 25-year veteran who served two stints in Vietnam, agreed.\n\"It means a lot,\" Cumings said of the plaque. \"I always compare it to the greeting I got in 1968 coming home from my first Vietnam tour.\"\nCumings went on to detail his time in the Army, year-by-year, during which he served in 24 countries. Cumings was part of the 196th Light Infantry during the Vietnam War and acted as an advisor to former U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger.\nAfter nearly a half-hour of reflection, the well-respected veteran stood up and thanked Dyott and Bayleigh Chase Chaplain the Rev. Bill Ferris for recognizing him. As Cumings walked out of the room, he left behind a trail of stories and memories, all of them depicting the life-long sacrifices he made for his country.\n\"That is why we want to honor our vets,\" Ferris said.\nTo learn more about the project, check out our story below.

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: Getting back to the Gospel\n\n October 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Craig Gaunt | Section: Columns \n \n 279\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In times as divisive as ours, the church has the message and the practice to bring together and heal: The Gospel.God created all humankind in His image, and that means we all reflect that image one way or another in our common humanity. That image in each of us is the basis of our worth.\nSadly, each of us are also broken by sin, that image having been marred in us all. We cannot point a finger in condemnation at those different from us because we are all guilty of selfishness, wanting our own way rather than selflessly living for others. The line between good and evil is not between categories in which we try to separate ourselves from others; it runs down each individual human heart.\nWe know this because, if we are honest, each of us are capable of acts of great kindness or great wickedness. None of us are guiltless.\nYet, the good news, the Gospel says that God in His love has given each of us a chance to experience that love and to have that image restored in us. When we accept what God in Jesus Christ has done for us, turn from living as we once did, and believe in Him, then His restoration process begins. He makes us into a brand new person, with the desire to do the good that our world needs.\nWe are given the chance to be human the way God intended by enjoying a personal relationship with Him and showing His love to everyone.\nThe good news that can bring healing and peace to everyone is that everyone is equally a sinner and, at the same time, everyone is equally loved. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
