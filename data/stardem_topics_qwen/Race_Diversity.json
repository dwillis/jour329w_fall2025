It's about antisemitism.\" \"It's not just about the Israelis,\" Hyman said.\"There are innocent people on both sides who suffer the consequences of all this stuff. It's painful, and it's hurtful.\" \"You know, my relationship with the local leaders of the Muslim community, I'm proud of,\" Hyman said. \"I like them a lot.They're good guys. We share experiences in many ways, historical and religious.\" Hanging on the wall in Hyman's office is a Muslim prayer rug featuring the 99 names of God. \"It's so beautiful, and I've always taken great pride in having that for a lot of reasons.\" Hyman also has long been involved with Boy Scouts organizations internationally, developing friendships across the Middle East.Hyman said Israel has \"a right to defend itself, as it should, and again, this goes beyond politics.This goes directly to antisemitism.It's heartbreaking.\" \"You're dealing with an organization that doesn't particularly have any sensitivity for life,\" he said. The organization, \"Hamas, definitely, have an agenda, but it's more than a political agenda.\" Saturday was an unsettling reminder of Hyman's stay in Israel 50 years before when, as a rabbinical student in 1973, he experienced the Yom Kippur War firsthand in Jerusalem.The morning after witnessing Israeli fighter jets fly low over the city, he and fellow students attended services.\"We go outside, and we're sitting on the steps to the Hebrew Union College which is right on King David Street,\" he said.\"And we notice that all the cars that are speeding by are filled with men and some women in army uniforms. And we're looking at each other going, 'Well that's interesting,'\" he said. \"The air raid sirens in Jerusalem went off, and when the sirens go off in Israel, it's not a test - it meant Israel's airspace was breached. That started the war, and the rest is history.\" The U.S. State Department defines antisemitism as \"a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\" According to a Sept. 11 Associated Press story, \"A network of Jewish security experts and religious leaders hosted several webinars to help prepare\" for the High Holidays, encompassing Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur \"as antisemitism surges.\" \"The High Holidays are about renewal - about trying to build a better world,\" said Rabbi Noah Farkas, president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.\"But we can't do that without a security regimen that makes people comfortable to go to synagogue,\" the AP story stated.Hyman believes the attack was timed to coincide with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, and the holiest day in Judaism.Hyman's friend, the Rev. James Nash is pastor of Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic Church, located across Easton Parkway from the synagogue.\"I just spoke to Father Nash,\" Hyman said. \"He just came back from a trip to Israel. He had another one planned for the springtime. And I was planning a trip to Israel in the spring as well.(The war) is going to impact that sort of thing.\" Nash said he was surprised to hear about the attack.\"When we were there, we felt safe. I'm not seeing everything, but people seemed to be getting along,\" Nash said. \"We would be in these restaurants, and there were Muslims there and Jewish people there. But that's just a tourist's view. Maybe we don't know the whole thing, but I was floored when I heard (about the attack.\" \"This has just got to be something that is just so, so difficult for Rabbi,\" Nash said. \"The rabbi is, first of all, a brilliant man.But second, he's worked so hard in the community. Whenever there's been some type of tragedy, he works hard to bring people together. He certainly is a man of peace.\" The Christian community needs to pray for their Jewish neighbors and the people of Israel, Nash said, but \"prayer has got to be followed by action.\" \"Whenever we hear antisemitic remarks, we need to respond to them immediately - not in a mean or hateful way, but calling people to task. As Rabbi was saying, there certainly seems to be a lot more antisemitism, and maybe it was always there. But now we hear it,\" Nash said.\"We need to make sure that we don't allow that kind of conversation to occur, where we're making antisemitic remarks and thinking that's all OK, just like any kind of derogatory remark about anybody is inappropriate,\" he said.\"Antisemitism is still upsetting and perplexing and I don't know how to fix it,\" Hyman said.\"When does it stop? That's the question: When does it stop?\" he said.As if to offer a solution, he told \"a great rabbinic story.\" \"This young rabbi is ordained, and he figures he's going to go out and change the world. So he tries and he realizes that the world is too big a place. So he says, 'I'll try to change the country in which I live,' and then he discovers that the country is too big, and he can't change the country. And he says, \"'I'll try and change my community,' but that turned out to be too big. And now that he's on his deathbed, he realizes if he had tried to change himself, he might have changed the world. That's always been a guiding story for me,\" Hyman said. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT/\n \nHaving just returned from Israel in November 2018, the Rev. James Nash of Sts.

    "content": "Black survivors nearly invisible in Catholic clergy sexual abuse crisis\n\n December 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 17 | Section: News \n \n 776\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BALTIMORE - As Charles Richardson gradually lost his eyesight to complications from diabetes, certain childhood memories haunted him even more.The Catholic priest appeared vividly in his mind's eye - the one who promised him a spot on a travel basketball team, took him out for burgers and helped him with homework.The one, Richardson alleges, who sexually assaulted him for more than a year.\"I've been seeing him a lot lately,\" Richardson said during a recent interview, dabbing tears from behind dark glasses.As a Black middle schooler from northwest Baltimore, Richardson started spending time with the Rev. Henry Zerhusen, a charismatic white cleric.Lauded as a \"super-priest\" when he died in 2003, Zerhusen welcomed his church's racial integration and implemented robust social service programs for struggling families, including Richardson's.For most of his life, Richardson kept the abuse a secret, a common experience for survivors of sexual abuse. But cases of clergy abuse among African Americans are especially underreported, according to experts, who argue the lack of attention adds to the trauma of an already vulnerable population.The U.S. Catholic Church generally does not publicly track the race or ethnicity of clergy abuse victims.Without that data, the full scope of clergy sex abuse and its effects on communities of color is unknown.\"Persons of color have suffered a long legacy of neglect and marginalization in the Catholic Church,\" said the Rev. Bryan Massingale, a Black Catholic priest and Fordham University professor whose research has focused on the issue. \"We need to correct the idea that all or most of the victims of this abuse have been white and male.\"Earlier this year, the Maryland Attorney General's Office released a scathing report on child sex abuse within the Archdiocese of Baltimore dating back several decades. The report documents more than 600 abuse cases but leaves out any context about race.There are clues, however, in the names of priests and churches listed.Out of 27 parishes in the archdiocese that have significant Black populations, at least 19 - 70% - previously had priests on staff who have been accused of sexual abuse, according to an Associated Press analysis.For parishes that experienced demographic shifts over time, these abusers were in residence in the years after Black membership increased and white membership declined.Not long after release of the attorney general's report, Maryland lawmakers voted to repeal the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse victims to sue. At age 58, Richardson retained a lawyer and decided to go public.Ray Kelly, a lifelong Catholic and chair of the pastoral council at St. Peter Claver, a Black parish in west Baltimore, said the archdiocese has repeatedly failed to address racial disparities, a trend that extends far beyond the clergy abuse crisis.In response to the 2020 racial justice protests, Kelly helped lead a working group convened by the Baltimore archbishop that focused on combating racism, but he said the archdiocese took little action after receiving the group's recommendations.He pointed to the Catholic Church's long history of treating African Americans like second-class citizens - beginning in Baltimore with the founding of the Oblate Sisters of Providence in 1829, when four Black women started their own religious order after being rejected by an existing sisterhood.The aftermath of the Civil War brought another new religious order to Baltimore: The Josephites were founded to minister to recently freed slaves. But despite their mission, for decades they largely did not admit Black men into the priesthood. The archdiocese now lists at least five Josephite priests as credibly accused of abuse.\"The Americanized Catholic Church still sees the Black population as a perpetual charity case, so to speak,\" Kelly said. \"And the predators are going to go where the prey is - Black communities relying on the church for support.\"Christian Kendzierski, the archdiocese spokesperson, said its leaders have taken significant steps to address the church's legacy of racism.He said the archdiocese's Office of Black Catholic Ministry works to \"lift up our Catholic social teaching related to the dignity of the human person and ensure worship is inclusive of the scope of the Catholic culture.\"Abuse also came from within the Black community.Among the alleged perpetrators were some of the archdiocese's few Black Catholic leaders.Survivors coming forward now, including Richardson, will likely receive smaller settlements since the archdiocese recently declared bankruptcy, allowing it to protect its assets more and shift the litigation to bankruptcy court, a less transparent forum.\"I feel like they are escaping responsibility,\" Richardson said.But for his part, Richardson recently found solace in telling his daughter about the abuse: \"A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.\" \n \n Caption: Charles Richardson, of Baltimore, wipes his eye while discussing his alleged abuse decades ago by a Catholic priest. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "King's granddaughter carrying forward his legacy\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JESSICA A. JOHNSON | Section: Columns \n \n 673\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I happened to catch the recent \"CBS Mornings\" news interview of Yolanda Renee King, the only grandchild of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. While promoting her new children's book honoring her grandparents titled \"We Dream a World,\" Yolanda gave a profound answer when asked what she would say to them if they were alive today. \"I think I would first start off with an apology,\" she said, which was surprising to CBS host Nate Burleson, who immediately asked the young activist what she meant by her response. Yolanda continued, \"An apology to where we are right now, as a nation and really as a world.\"Yolanda is only 15 years old, and it is evident that she has a deep understanding of what her grandparents fought for as leaders of the civil rights movement. In August of last year, during the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, Yolanda boldly declared that her generation would \"be defined by action, not apathy.\"\nAs Yolanda is growing up before our eyes, she has the youthful exuberance of her grandfather's resolve and displays the dignified grace of her grandmother. Yolanda saying she would apologize to her grandparents for our nation not yet reaching the potential they believed in should make us thoughtfully reflect on how Dr. King also warned about becoming apathetic.\nApathy is a brutal paralyzer of life. It can cause us to be ensnared in a dangerous mode of stagnation emotionally, spiritually, and sometimes physically. Apathy also triggers entitled disinterest in our society. In 2021, Tom Nichols, an instructor at Harvard Extension School and the U.S. Naval War College, asserted in an interview with The Harvard Gazette that \"narcissism and nihilism\" are the primary threats to our country's democracy and societal relationships. Elaborating on the latter, Nichols said that many people ask why our society is \"so mean and heartless and awful,\" but many of them do not contribute anything to make their communities better, or they will vote against policies that affect their well-being due to \"narcissistic beefs.\"\n\"We have become surly villagers,\" Nichols maintained, \"me, my family, my little plot of land, and everybody else can go to hell.\" This type of sullen attitude is what Yolanda is urging our country to overcome as she is an emerging voice on critical issues such as gun violence and homelessness.\nAs Yolanda continues to attentively study the Godly principles that enabled her grandfather to be that drum major for justice who changed the course of our nation, I am reminded of two of his sermons where he encouraged his followers to live with purpose and passion and to shower others with Christian love.\nThe first sermon is titled \"But If Not,\" a 1967 message that King delivered at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church. King expresses that the \"ultimate test\" of our faith is when we get to a \"but if not\" moment in life, a moment where we have to travel along an arduous journey with no other option but to lean on God's promises.\nThis passage stands out to avoid being gripped by apathy during a spiritual test: \"... somewhere along the way [in life] you should discover something that's so dear, so precious to you, that is so eternally worthful, that you will never give it up.\" The second sermon is \"Levels of Love,\" an Ebenezer address King gave in 1962. He implored the congregation to \"rise to agape, to Christian love\" because \"[t]he greatness of it is that you love every man, not for your sake but for his sake. And you love every man because God loves him.\"\nIt is remarkable that Yolanda exemplifies the love and compassion her grandparents demonstrated as she diligently works to uplift others. She is blazing her own path, and it is truly inspiring to watch it unfold. She probably has not had a \"but if not\" moment yet in her young life thus far, but I have no doubt she is developing the character and strength to face the challenges she knows are coming. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Within her first two years in the country, she moved to Easton.\n\"It's very exciting for me as well, because it's a way to represent the Eastern Shore (and) the Hispanic community, which is our main goal, mission and focus in this center,\" she said. \"So hopefully we can keep expanding this representation and working for the community.\"\nFor now, Gomez Lozano's focus on the commission is representation for the rural region and learning as she goes.\nBut in the future, she hopes to move forward policies to benefit Hispanic communities, which represent a fast-growing demographic in the state.\nGrowth in the Eastern Shore's Hispanic population is something Gomez Lozano and her colleagues at ChesMRC have seen in the 10 years since the nonprofit launched.\nThe organization served about 3,500 people last year, according to Matthew Peters, the center's executive director.\nLocally, Gomez Lozano wants to promote awareness of the expanding Hispanic community's existence and the services ChesMRC provides for residents.\nShe has served as the center's Hispanic outreach coordinator for over six years — a job that's had her acting in multiple capacities as an interpreter, a notary and a certified application counselor for health insurance, among others. She is also a resource for first-generation college students and works with ChesMRC's development committee.\n\"If everybody's aware (of us), then we can always offer a more welcoming environment,\" Gomez Lozano said. \"Because sometimes, even just visiting one agency can make a whole difference, just the way you receive and treat people.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast and Banquet at Washington College for Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday.The event was put on by the MLK Joint Committee, which is made up of Minary's Dream Alliance, Chester Valley Ministers Association, Washington College Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience, the Kent County NAACP and Kent County Parks and Recreation.\nDoncella Wilson, co-executive director of Minary's Dream Alliance, said a variety of community members — from elected officials to students — come out for this event every year.\n\"So it's a good representation of what the community truly looks like,\" she said.\nThe celebration kicked off with a breakfast at Hodson Hall Dining Hall. After that, attendees walked over to the Decker Theatre at the Gibson Center for the Arts on campus to hear speeches and watch performances.\nThe program opened with a reenactment of the Greensboro Four, a group of college students in North Carolina protesting segregation laws through staging a sit-in at the Woolworth's lunch counter.\nSinging resounded through the theater at various times throughout the program, including a performance of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" often referred to as the Black National Anthem, by Amiya Potts and a performance by singer, songwriter and author Ty Bolden, singing her song \"Free Woman.\"\nJamie \"Mixx\" Barrett was awarded the Commissioner William W. Pickrum Service Award.\nBarrett, a graduate of Kent County High School and Maryland Barber School, owns Big Mixx's Beautiful Beginnings Unisex Salon. A member of the Kent County Local Management Board, mentor and licensed foster parent, Barrett serves his community in more ways than one.\nPaul Tue III, co-executive director of Minary's Dream Alliance, said young people were infused throughout the program.\n\"And that's on purpose,\" he said.\nTue hosted a \"barbershop conversation\" during the program, with four Kent County High School students involved with Young Men Standing on Business. Tue asked the students questions about their takes on King's legacy.\nPat Nugent, the Miller Director of Civic Engagement at the Starr Center, said getting younger people involved helps to pass on the legacy.\n\"And that's really what the day is about,\" he said. \"To infuse younger generations with a sense of civic duty and obligation, as well as to connect them to generations of folks who have been doing that in Kent County for decades.\"\nThe keynote speaker of the program, Jermichael Mitchell, a writer, philanthropist and community activist who ran for mayor of Salisbury this past year, talked about purpose.\n\"No matter what your age may be, young or old, every last one of us is born with a purpose,\" he said. \"Every last one of us is born to do something in this world. And in order for us to live our dreams, we have to actually know that purpose and embody that purpose and move forward.\"\nMitchell talked about King \"walking in his purpose\" every day, no matter what he faced.\nShaila Parker, who attended the event said its important that King is recognized every year because he did so much to help unify people.\n\"(He) helped make sure everyone has access to different things, has rights, is respected, has dignity,\" she said.\nLisa Moody, who has been attending the event since 2017, said one thing special about Kent County is that when there is an event, the county comes out for it.\n\"So it's a great place to meet people or reunite with people,\" she said. \"And of course with today being the MLK holiday, it's a good reason for us to all come together for a specific purpose.\"\nSaturday, Jan. 20, at 3:30 p.m., the public is invited to back to Decker Theatre to watch the premiere of \"Get on The Bus,\" a documentary that follows local students and community members take a journey from Chestertown to The Legacy Museum in Montgomery, Alabama to deliver historic materials. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore to be on the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture. His term is from 2023 to 2027.According to MCAAH website, the purpose of the \"the commission is to identify and preserve buildings, communities and sites of historical and cultural importance to the African American experience in Maryland. This competitive program, offered once per year, is supported through an annual appropriation from the Maryland General Assembly and is administered as a joint partnership of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture and The Maryland Historical Trust.\"\nThey give away $5 million a year, and Moaney works with his commission to find suitable candidates who are either architecturally or culturally preserving Black history and identity.\n\"It is the first ever ethnic commission in the United States. It is something that our colleagues across the country look to as an example. I feel humble to join the group as the youngest. The commission, in general, documents, collects African American heritage across the state,\" said Moaney.\nHe covers Delmarva for the commission and currently lives in Cambridge with his wife. Moaney is a product of Talbot County Public Schools, where he played football. He went to Williams College in Massachusetts.\nMoaney said he hopes to energize the commission.\n\"I am trying to expand notions of Blackness that center on joy, that center freedom, agency and maybe push and highlight elements of our culture here on the Shore that often get overlooked. I think we have to reinforce accurate portrayals of Black life as well as ones that normalize our culture,\" he said.\nHe takes a long historical look at how Black people have suffered in America.\n\"Our country is really trying to reconcile with wounds that haven't fully healed or even the past few weeks, some that are opening up scars that are deeper than we could imagine. Like the people of Haiti, who have a large population in Salisbury now, or the people who were elected in Federalsburg for the first time in centuries — have the space to give it justice,\" he said.\nMoaney will bring the commission to Chestertown for a public meeting in April. That meeting will be in the Bethel AME Church, where the Freedom Riders came and stayed in 1962.\n\"We have regular commission meetings that will happen all over the state. It is a beauty to be at the sites we are trying to preserve. Some are trying to be restored, some have been restored, some are receiving grants,\" Moaney said.\n\"I was assigned two committees. One was African American Heritage Preservation Program. The funding for that just got raised by the assembly from $1 million to $5 million. Close to 50% of the awardees were on the Eastern Shore. It is a collaboration with the Maryland Historical Trust which is in the Department of Planning,\" he said.\nAmong the grants awarded by the commission through the Historical Preservation Program for fiscal year 2024 are:\n$250,000 for the American Legion Mannie Scott Post 193 Building in Denton.\n$138,000 to Alpha Genesis Community Development Corporation in Cambridge.\n$200,000 to Kent County Public Library.\n$250,000 to Bryan's United Methodist Church in Grasonville.\n$250,000 to the Mid-Shore Community Foundation in Royal Oak.\nThe grants will offer assistance to organizations and private citizens in their sponsorship of projects involving the acquisition, construction, or improvement of sites related to African American heritage, according to a press release from the governor's office.\nMoaney's other appointment is to the Inaugural Statewide Book Drive. \"The best part are the oral histories. There are so many discoveries. It's a privilege to be there,\" he said.\nOutside of his work on the commission, Moaney is the founder of literacy group called the Needle's Eye Academy.\n\"If you are familiar with Gil Scott-Heron. He was arguably the soundtrack to the Black power movement as a poet and a musician and an oralist. The song 'Needles Eye' is where the Academy's name emanates from. From the 1972 album 'Pieces of the Man,'\" he said.\n\"They have been asking, 'Are there any college age students who will speak to high schoolers and maybe even start a book club. We donated our old book sales into Berkshire County Public Schools (Massachusetts). In August of 2020 we started online in Talbot County Public Schools with three wonderful students.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Woodson founded what is now the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. The following year, he began publishing what is now The Journal of African American History, a publication of history, research and book reviews.\nIn 1926, Woodson founded \"Negro History Week\" to honor the history, culture and contributions of African Americans. He chose February to coincide with the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln. In 1976, President Gerald Ford extended the observation to a month, now known as Black History Month.\nWoodson believed that history was \"made by the people, not simply or primarily by great men.\"\nLocal writer, Niambi Davis had the opportunity to contribute to the Black History display at Bethel AME. The subjects, Davis said, \"are important and more than just the usual Douglass and Tubman stories; they're the unknown local, national and international folks.\"\nThe display is open to the congregation and anyone wishing to attend services. Service begins at 11 a.m. Sunday mornings. The church is located on Washington Road in Centreville. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Despite efforts to remove them, Confederates, segregationists live on in Capitol statues\n\n February 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BRENNAN STEWART Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 874\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n February is Black History Month, an observance meant to honor and celebrate the achievements made by African Americans throughout the history of the United States.But reminders of the oppression that African Americans suffered are still on display in the United States Capitol, taking the form of 12 statues of figures affiliated with the Confederate States of America and post-Civil War segregation.\nIndeed, visitors to the Capitol might be startled to see civil rights icon Rosa Parks just across the room from Confederate President Jefferson Davis. And the continued presence of Confederates and segregationists in statuary in a symbol of democracy amazes scholars as well.\n\"While the effects of having Confederate statues in Washington — much less in the nation's capital — should be quite clear, what still surprises me years after statues started being removed is that something like this is still a possibility,\" Lester Spence, professor of political science and Africana studies at Johns Hopkins University, told Capital News Service.\nMany of the offending figures stand in the National Statuary Hall, located just steps from the Capitol's iconic Rotunda. Once the meeting place of the U.S. House of Representatives, the massive semicircular room was transformed into a statue gallery in 1864. Under federal law, each state is allowed to provide no more than two statues to the collection.\nBy 1933, the hall became overcrowded with 65 statues making up three circular rows along the circumference. Not only did the room start to look visually unappealing but concerns also were raised about the chamber's structural integrity.\nAs a result, Congress passed a law saying that one statue from each state could remain in Statuary Hall while the others would be relocated to other areas of the Capitol.\nToday, five statues with Confederate ties remain in Statuary Hall, including Davis and his vice president, Alexander Stephens. Four others are located in the Capitol Visitor Center, two are in the crypt under the rotunda, and one more is in the Hall of Columns underneath the House chamber.\nArkansas, Georgia, Mississippi and North Carolina currently have both of their two permitted statues linked to the Confederacy or segregation, while Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina and West Virginia each have one.\nHowever, three of the 12 statues are facing replacement.\nThen-Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) signed legislation in 2019 to replace his state's statues of Uriah Rose, a Confederate sympathizer, and James Paul Clarke, a former U.S. senator and white supremacist. They are set to be replaced with statues of civil rights activist Daisy Bates and musician Johnny Cash.\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) signed a formal request in 2018 for the removal of the statue depicting former Gov. Charles Aycock (D), who served in office from 1901 to 1905 and was a supporter of segregation. Aycock is going to be replaced by evangelist Rev. Billy Graham, but there have been several delays in getting the statue to Washington.\n\"When we first started the process in 2018, we were shooting for 2021 but the global pandemic and a couple of other things threw us off,\" said Garrett Dimond, attorney for the North Carolina General Assembly. \"We would like to do [the unveiling] in the spring, but that's up to Congress to schedule the ceremony.\"\nFor a new statue to be displayed in the Capitol, it must first go through several stages of approval at both the state and federal levels, Dimond explained. The process starts with the governor, who submits the bill for a new statue to the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress.\n\"The next step is actually going through the artist selection process, putting together a full-sized clay model and then doing the complete stack — so there's a lot of approvals that happen with that,\" Dimond said.\nThe Confederate Monument Removal Act was introduced to Congress in 2017 by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), in the wake of the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville. Under her bill, all statues depicting individuals who willingly served in the Confederate States Army would be removed from the Statuary Hall collection within 120 days.\nIn February of last year, Lee reintroduced the bill with Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).\nThere has been no action so far on that legislation.\nRep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) is another member of Congress who has pressed for the removal of the offending statues. Hoyer successfully passed bills twice in the House in 2020 and 2021 that would replace a bust of Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, who ruled in the 1857 Dred Scott decision that a Black man was not a citizen, with a bust of Supreme Court Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black justice appointed to the high court.\nThe bill would also have removed the statues of Aycock, Clarke and Vice President John C. Calhoun, a supporter of slavery. But neither measure passed the Senate.\n\"We can't change history, but we can certainly make it clear who we honor,\" Hoyer said in a statement last week. \"I'm proud to have led efforts to remove statues and symbols honoring Confederate and white supremacist leaders, and I lament that this is not a priority for today's Republican House majority.\"\n\"I remain committed to working with members from either party who are committed to ensuring these symbols of hate have no place in Congress,\" Hoyer added. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lawmakers propose task force to probe long-term inequities facing Black women\n\n February 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TORRENCE BANKS Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 817\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — The persistence of economic, educational and legal disparities in the lives of Black women and girls would be the target of a federal task force recently proposed by a group of House members.\"Simply acknowledging our country's history of targeted discrimination, harassment and violence against Black women and girls will not correct years of systemic racism and sexism,\" Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Illinois) said in a statement after the legislation creating the task force was introduced earlier this month.\n\"We must leverage the full weight of the federal government to seek justice for Black women and girls who deserve an equal opportunity for a full, happy, healthy life,\" Kelly said.\nKelly is co-chair of the Caucus on Black Women and Girls, along with Reps. Yvette Clarke of New York and Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, who also sponsored the measure. Reps. Jennifer McClellan (D-Virginia), Valerie Foushee (D-North Carolina) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pennsylvania) also have signed on to the bill, called the \"Protect Black Women and Girls Act.\"\nThe bill would establish a task force to examine several aspects of the lives of Black women and girls, including education, healthcare, economic development, housing and civil rights. The task force would look at the effectiveness of programs and policies at the state, federal and local levels and make recommendations for changes.\nKelly said that the bill would help governments be more proactive in ensuring that Black women receive equal opportunities.\nThe task force would be led by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice. Both would then share information with the United States Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR).\nThe civil rights commission also would conduct a study and collect data about the social justice, economic and health effects of discrimination and inequities on Black women and girls. The bill was originally introduced in 2021 with 15 co-sponsors. However, Congress took no action on it.\nMaryland Del. Jheanelle Wilkins, a Democrat, said the legislation would allow the state's government to look at the results from the research and craft more equitable policies.\n\"We know that signs point to black women being disproportionately impacted by many things whether it's maternal health — and in Maryland, Black women are four times as likely to die as a result of childbirth,\" said Wilkins, who also serves as the chair of the state's Legislative Black Caucus.\nIn 2021, the maternal mortality rate of non-Hispanic Black women was 69.9 births per 100,000 live births, according to the Centers for Disease Control. That was more than two times the rate for non-Hispanic white women.\n\"We are the caregivers for our community, we're the matriarchs of our home, but also of the Black community,\" said Kelli Richardson Lawson, founder of the mental health nonprofit organization The SonRise Project, based in Bethesda, Maryland. \"So we've always had to take care of everybody else before we take care of ourselves.\"\nLawson said that the passage of the legislation is crucial because of the socioeconomic challenges that Black women have faced.\nThirty-nine percent of white women earn a bachelor's or associate degree by the age of 29, compared to 21% of Black women, according to the American Association of University Women.\n\"Based on what I've seen, this bill would help mitigate some of the issues that we see involving Black women and girls in a variety of areas,\" said Lawson, whose non-profit serves as a safe space for Black parents to discuss issues involving teen mental health.\nBlack girls also face disadvantages in education. A 2020-2021 school discipline report from the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights found that \"Black girls were nearly two times more likely to receive one or more in-school suspensions, one or more out-of-school suspensions, and expulsions than White girls.\"\nIn addition, Black school-aged girls are four times more likely to be arrested in school than white girls, according to research discussed on Kelly's web page.\nJohn Berkley, coordinator for the National Pan-Hellenic Council in Maryland, Virginia and several other states, said that Maryland has many organizations working to help Black women. Knowing that Congress is backing them up with legislation would be a huge boost, he said.\n\"Now they could say that It's not only a community effort but also a national policy that we now have some teeth behind,\" Berkley said. \"And maybe with that, that will bring more awareness to what's going on with Black females in our various raised communities.\"\nBerkley said that he plans to travel with his fraternity to Annapolis in a couple of weeks to talk to his legislators to see what they're doing to help Congress move the bill along.\nLawson said the task force could lead to the creation of more programs and organizations like hers, where Black women are free to focus on themselves and have vulnerable conversations.\n\"Changing the narrative, so that we can take off that cape, we can take a deep breath and exhale, and we can start to focus on ourselves,\" Lawson said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The location where James Taylor, a 23-year-old Black man, was lynched in 1892.That soil would find its way more than 800 miles south in a powerful message to remember a bleak chapter in history.\nThat journey was followed in the documentary film \"Get on the Bus.\"\nForty-two Kent County youths and adults made the trek, traveling to Civil Rights era landmarks in Alabama and Georgia, including the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; the King Center in Atlanta, Edmund Pettus Bridge and the National Voting Rights Museum in Selma and the Equal Justice Initiative's Community Remembrance Project in Montgomery.\nDirected by Justinian Dispenza of Andover Media, the film debuted on Valentine's Day at the Decker Theatre in Washington College with almost 200 people in attendance. it was also shown the at Ocean City Film Festival earlier this month.\nAfter its debut, the powerful emotions it invoked resulted in people interested in screening it.\nFor Dispenza, it's uplifting to see his work yielding these results.\n\"That's what we're all aiming to do as filmmakers. To make a change in people's lives. It was an incredible experience,\" he said.\nAs people left the theatre, Dispenza reflected on the process of creating \"Get on the Bus\" in slight awe.\nBecause it did not start out as being a film.\nThe idea initially came from Program Director of Minary's Dream Alliance Paul Tue III and Co-Chair of the James Taylor Justice Coalition Philip Dutton, to take a trip, educating people about the past, to the roots of the Civil Rights Movement, Alabama.\nWhat started as a field trip where Dispenza was brought on to take pictures became something else.\nDispenza, no stranger to films about social issues, was eager.\nExcept there were obstacles.\nBefore they left, he was diagnosed with Lyme's Disease. Forced to take antibiotics on the road, he was told by his doctor to avoid the sun.\n\"That's kinda tough to do, July in the Deep South,\" Dispenza said, laughing.\nIt was five days in that sweltering heat with cameras rolling 24-7, no cloud in sight.\nWhile he and Lead Editor Tanner Presswood filmed, Dispenza used long sleeves like protective gear and a floppy hat to ward off the sun.\nPerhaps if he didn't feel a strong sense of purpose, he would have thought of his discomfort more than three times in the trip. But seeing through the lens of time how racism was a way of life for many, which seemed like a different universe to him, busied him in a beneficial way.\nThey went to sites like the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, where on Sunday, September 15, 1963, at 10:22 a.m., the church became known around the world when a bomb exploded, killing four young girls attending Sunday School.\nEastern Shore girls the age of those victims read that and marveled.\n\"How can someone hate someone so much that they could hurt them and have no consideration in their heart?\" Love Jackson asked.\nAs they ascended the steps to the upper part of the church they witnessed a reenactment of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.\nOvercome by the strong feelings standing where King stood, Pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Chestertown Joel Tolbert opened up.\n\"I sit in the pulpit every Sunday. But I tried to stand in that pulpit...it's a hard space,\" he acknowledged.\nThe emotions would heighten.\nJust down the road there were statues of attack dogs, replicas of what Black people faced in 1963. There was a statue of children against the wall in a firing line and statues of enslaved people in chains, heads down in despair.\nBroadcasted at the The National Memorial for Peace and Justice were some of the reasons they were lynched, horrific in their simplicity and ignorance.\nOne was lynched for not tipping his hat to the police officer.\nAnother to yield a better return in the sharecropping business.\nThere was one, where, since a man could not be found, his 2-year-old daughter was lynched in his place.\nThe group journeyed to Selma. At the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they crossed as others did in 1965, knowing that beatings, dogs and water hoses waited for them on the other side.\nFounder of Minary's Dream Alliance, Doncella Wilson, felt that weight. Crossing the same bridge that 600 Civil Rights marchers crossed, she had to stop in the middle and reflect, before walking on., head high.\nThe camera captured the moment.\nInside the Equal Justice Initiative Museum while delivering the soil as an addition to the Legacy Museum, Dispenza broke down himself.\nHe sat on the floor and cried, having taken some ownership of the atrocities committed. But through that pain and despair, the tears and sorrow, shone hope.\n\"People were not afraid to be vulnerable,\" Dispenza said. \"It led to healing.\"\nThey were receptive to the filming process too, seeing it as a tool to do good. \"It was a tough film but a beautiful film,\" Dispenza said.\nAnd the results of the film did not leave people in despair.\nOne resident leaving Decker Theatre told him the film \"had given him a peace and hope he's never had before.\"\nThroughout the film there were positive messages to the youth. Wilson told a group of children the activists they have read about and heard were no older than they were. Tue told the youths they don't know how powerful they are.\nDispenza's film echoed with its audience as well. After the debut, it has been featured at the Bill Johnson Film Festival in Indiana.\nTue, who was with them through the entire trip, was amazed at how the footage was compiled altogether.\nHe told Dispenza, \"My God, this is going places!\"\nWith eight or nine screenings already having taken place, he was certainly not wrong.\nDispenza sees this as an urgent message to spread. \"This conversation needs to be had as school districts try to suppress Critical Race Theory,\" he said.\nIt is a topic debated among educational groups. Dispenza is more than happy to pursue these challenges and encouraged those who have great story ideas to reach out to him at Andover Media.\nFor more of his projects, visit his Imdb page at imdb.com/name/nm14340956/ as well. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Under the employ of John Silcox, from Kennedyville, Taylor was accused of the rape of the former's 11-year-old daughter. When captured, he was brought to Chestertown and thrown in jail.\nRecords indicate that the Sheriff made attempts to keep Taylor away from the almost 500 people demanding him lynched.\nEventually, on May 19, \"a body of masked men carrying an assortment of weapons forced the Sheriff to open the (jail) door.\"\nThey busted in with a sledgehammer and hung Taylor's body outside of town limits. On Cross Street, they then hung Taylor on a tree.\nThere are reports that the mob met with Chestertown officials and agreed on terms of the lynching.\nIt couldn't be in the town, and they could not mutilate the body.\nTaylor proclaimed his innocence up to the hour of his death, as reported by The Sun. The people who killed him were not brought to justice.\nIt was this tragic story, Dutton, co-chair of the James Taylor Justice Coalition, wants remembered.\nHis organization is creating a marker in Taylor's honor and have been in talks with the town for several months about where to place it.\nDuring the March 4 Mayor and Council meeting, Dutton addressed town officials.\nHe wants the marker placed at Fountain Park. \"Chestertown can acknowledge the past failures and own up to the truth of the past to get healing in the future,\" he said.\nBy placing it there, the town would be sending a strong message to the public, he added.\nDutton shared support he's received for choosing this location, including that of Millington Mayor Kevin Hemstock.\nThere, it attracts more pedestrian traffic and sends a strong message about the town's diversity.\nFailure to do so sends the opposite message, Dutton believes.\nHowever, there are three proposed sites the marker could go — Fountain Park, the Kent County Courthouse or on Cross Street, beside Town Hall.\nThere are complications and arguments to be made for all locations.\nAt Cross Street, where Taylor was lynched, the council would need to seek approval from the State Highway Administration.\n\"Cross Street doesn't seem like a state road but it is,\" pointed out Mayor David Foster.\nDutton saw this location as a \"slap in the face,\" because there is already a marker there, for George Vickers, a known racist, he said.\nA member from the audience proposed Vicker's marker be removed and Taylor's put in its place.\nCouncil member Tim O' Brien said he'd study up on the issue further for future meetings.\nFor those arguing for the courthouse, there is historical precedence there too. As a resident pointed out, it's where the injustice began.\nDespite these reasons, Dutton maintained the park is the best fit.\nHowever, a member of the Chestertown Garden Club objected to this location. In her opinion, the club worked hard for years to beautify that area. She said it was once almost destined to be a parking lot and then sidewalks, lighting, trees and shrubs were put in to make a \"peaceful green place.\"\nShe said by putting it there, it might open up the floodgates.\nDutton said it was disingenuous of the Garden Club to not want a marker when they already have one.\nHe quoted Scott Ellsworth, author of the \"Groundbreaking,\" a book about the Tulsa Race Massacre in 1921, \"History is not just a chronicle of events but a mirror of where we want to be.\"\nHe made an appeal to the council.\n\"The town did a great injustice to Taylor. We have to announce those days are over. Putting a marker in Fountain Park will just be the thing to do that.\"\nFoster and the council seemingly agree the marker should be displayed, but haven't decided on the best location yet. They said the matter would be discussed further in upcoming sessions. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Settlement calls for apology, restorative measures in Federalsburg voting rights case\n\n April 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 921\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FEDERALSBURG — Plaintiffs in a historic lawsuit against Federalsburg this week reached a $260,000 settlement that includes an apology to the town's Black residents and other requirements memorializing the case.At a table in the newly opened Harlem's Kitchen restaurant in Federalsburg, two Black residents of the town, Roberta Butler and Jeff Stevenson Jr., sat down Friday to discuss shifts in their hometown.\nMuch of the change in Federalsburg is visible. On Sept. 26, the town elected its first two Black council members, a result of the lawsuit leading to the town's settlement with the Caroline County branch of the NAACP, the Caucus of African American Leaders and Federalsburg residents regarding its discriminatory election system.\n\"It's a work in progress,\" Butler said. \"But I think we will get there.\"\nThe settlement is seen by many as not only a step forward for Federalsburg, but for the nation.\nThe conversation between the two Federalsburg residents echoed those happening throughout the town. Butler said Federalsburg's historically Black community is happy about the settlement.\nFor Butler, who was a plaintiff in the lawsuit, it's about the future generations. She said her grandchildren are \"very excited\" and added that if you talked with her granddaughter, her granddaughter would say \"'My mom mom is doing this for me.\"\n\"I'm proud of all my grandkids,\" Butler said. \"I'm doing it for them.\"\nStevenson, who was not named in the lawsuit but who ran for mayor in the September election, said a lot of the town's Black residents just want to see change.\n\"We just hope that they take us (seriously),\" he said.\nThe April 1 settlement includes a sweeping array of measures aimed at providing reconciliation after Federalsburg's previous at-large election system was determined to have prevented Black residents from electing their chosen representatives.\nThe town's Black population has grown steadily over the years, with Black residents now accounting for about 43% of the roughly 2,800-resident population.\nBut until last September, the town had never had Black representatives on the Town Council in its 200-year history.\nThe settlement came just over a year after the plaintiffs filed suit in federal court in Baltimore under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Through months of charter amendments, legislation and federal court rulings, the town's previous at-large election system was changed in June to a two-district system to ensure more representation of Federalsburg's Black residents. District 1 has a 64% Black population and District 2 is predominantly white.\nTwo Black women were elected to the Town Council during Federalsburg's Sept. 26 election — Darlene Pitt Hammond and Brandy James.\nThe settlement calls for a total of $260,000 in legal fees to be paid by the town to the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland Foundation. Within 30 days of the agreement, $50,000 to be paid to the ACLU, then $35,000 every October between 2025 and 2030.\nUnder the settlement, the town will be required to:\nDeliver an official signed and written apology addressed to those who brought the lawsuit. This apology will be framed and posed permanently in Federalsburg's town hall.\nAffix a plaque \"marking the town's voting rights victory brought about through the contributions of the Plaintiffs in this case\" to the town hall building.\nCreate a photo display in conjunction with the historical society and the plaintiffs featuring Black community contributions to the town, which will be displayed at town hall.\nRename Gerardi Boulevard to Brooklyn Avenue.\nErect a historical marker in the town's Black community of Brooklyn celebrating the contributions of the neighborhood's residents and their ancestors.\nProclaim Sept. 26 as Voting Rights Day in recognition of Black voters' historic win on that date in 2023.\nCreate a town committee to focus on community engagement in future elections and matters related to the promotion, engagement and enhancement of the town's diverse community. At least one elected town official and two community members from each election district will serve on the committee.\nEstablish an annual multicultural celebration for the town.\n\"The Town of Federalsburg formally acknowledges responsibility and expresses its deep regret for actions and inactions contributing to racial discrimination and exclusion of Black residents, including its use of an election system that prevented any Black person from holding a position on the Town Council over 200 years,\" reads the town's written apology. \"As officials of the Town, we accept moral accountability for the harms these actions inflicted upon Black residents, their families, and ancestors before them.\"\nCarl Snowden, convener of the Caucus of African American Leaders, said that in his more than 30 years of involvement in voting rights cases, he has never before seen a municipality willing to admit its wrongs and apologize for it.\nHe said this \"historic landmark decision\" is bigger than Federalsburg.\n\"What Federalsburg has done is become a model to what can happen throughout Maryland and the rest of the nation,\" he said.\nSnowden said he will use Federalsburg as a model in other cases the caucus takes on.\nWillie Woods, president of the Caroline County branch of the NAACP called the settlement rewarding.\nShe said they are focusing on what has been accomplished and plan to build on that success moving forward.\n\"Build on the foundation that's been put in place,\" Woods said.\nAn event to celebrate the settlement is in the works.\n\"There's a degree of optimism when you have achieved something you worked hard for and you wondered if it would come to pass,\" Woods said. \"And to see that that has happened — Yes, that's going to be a major celebration.\"\nSince the settlement, Butler has been thinking about her parents, grandparents and other Black Federalsburg residents that are no longer alive.\n\"I just wish my ancestors could have seen this,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bridge should be named for Gloria Richardson\n\n April 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM JOHNSON jjohnson@chespub.com | Section: Columns \n \n 771\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Caucus of African American Leaders this week proposed renaming the Frederick C. Malkus Bridge across the Choptank River to the Gloria Richardson Bridge.The proposal is a good idea and should be approved by the Maryland legislature when it is introduced. Richardson is a far better representative of American values than Malkus was.\nRichardson was a leader in the Civil Rights Movement in Cambridge in the early 1960s, one of the only female leaders of the movement at the time. She was arrested for picketing against a segregated Cambridge business while the National Guard occupied Cambridge.\nHer fiery, steely, fearless personality was captured by an Associated Press photographer as Richardson pushed a bayonet-tipped National Guard rifle away as she moved through a crowd in Cambridge.\nAccording to a Washington Post obituary when Richardson died in July 2021 at age 99, she \"remained uncompromising in her demands for equal access to public accommodations such as white-owned restaurants and bowling alleys. A public-accommodations provision went to referendum in October 1963, but she persuaded followers to boycott the vote. She explained that it was grossly unfair to leave 'the constitutional rights of our people to the whim of a popular majority.'\"\n\"Throughout her life, she spoke truth to power and continued to inspire people around the world — and in her hometown,\" reads Richardson's biography written by the Maryland Commission for Women.\nIn a Star Democrat article written after Richardson's death, Dorchester County Orphans' Court Chief Judge the Rev. George Ames noted leading the movement in Cambridge was not easy.\n\"She was an inspiration because she stood up at a time when people, and women in particular, didn't stand up,\" he said. \"It had to be hard for her.\"\nAfter stepping down from her leadership role, Richardson married photographer Frank Dandridge and moved to New York, where she spent much of her life working on anti-poverty issues and programs for the aging in New York City, according to the Washington Post.\nBy contrast, Frederick C. Malkus, the bridge's current namesake, fought to maintain the second-class status of African Americans in Cambridge and Maryland.\nWhen Malkus retired from the Maryland Senate in 1994, he had spent nearly five decades as a legislator.\nIn the 1960s, while Cambridge was going through protests against racial discrimination and Freedom Riders challenged the region's deeply rooted segregation, Malkus' civil rights voting record largely reflected the segregationist views of his mostly white, rural constituency.\nThe Baltimore Sun referred to him in 1966 as a \"consistent opponent of civil rights legislation.\"\nIn 1962, then Gov. J. Millard Tawes called a special session of the Maryland General Assembly to consider a public accommodations law that would outlaw racial discrimination in inns, hotels, restaurants and other similar establishments.\nThe Eastern Shore contingent, led by Malkus, opposed the bill, and through their efforts, a provision was added to the legislation allowing counties to exempt themselves from the statute, according to Peter Levy, author of \"Civil War on Race Street: The Civil Rights Movement in Cambridge, Maryland.\"\nLevy wrote that Malkus participated in a debate on civil rights with then Alabama Gov. George Wallace at Goucher College in Towson, during which Malkus and Wallace denounced pending civil rights legislation as un-American.\nThe bridge between Talbot and Dorchester counties was not the only one proposed for renaming by the Caucus of African American Leaders this week.\nThe caucus also passed a resolution calling for state officials to rename the Francis Scott Key Memorial Bridge, which collapsed last month after being struck by a cargo ship.\n\"The Francis Scott Key Bridge was named in honor of a man who enslaved African Americans and wrote lyrics that scholars have indicated demeaned Black people,\" a press release from the Caucus of African American Leaders said.\nBoth proposals face opposition.\n\"This has been controversial from Day 1,\" said caucus organizer Carl Snowden in an interview with the Star Democrat this week. \"It's not unusual before decisions like this are made that it's a protracted, long, sometimes intense debate on whether or not to do it.\"\nI hope public officials in Dorchester and Talbot counties endorse this proposal as soon as possible before the intense debate begins.\nGloria Richardson was a leader in the fight for equal rights for African Americans in Cambridge at a time when segregation was the rule. Her words, quoted by the Maryland Commission for Women are as much a beacon today as they were in the 1960s.\n\"A first-class citizen does not beg for freedom,\" Richardson said. \"A first-class citizen does not plead to the power structure to give him something that whites have no power to give or take away. Human rights are human rights, not white rights.\"\nJim Johnson is executive editor of the Star Democrat. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bush, Starr Center for the Study of the American at Washington College Deputy Director Jaelon T. Moaney, St. Mary's College of Maryland senior Phoebe Tate and Roderick Lewis, who is Sen. Ben Cardin's Southern Maryland field representative.\n\"They are incredible leaders who are starting to move forward in this world,\" Historic Sotterley Executive Director Nancy Easterling said of the panel, \"and making a real difference, and their ideas and perspectives will be appreciated.\"\nA news release stated the Civil Rights Act was a milestone in American democracy and justice, dismantling Jim Crow laws and paving a way for racial and gender equality. But with all the progress made, equality is still something that eludes many in the nation.\n\"Sixty years might seem like a long time ago for some of us,\" Bush said. \"But as they say, 'Time and even age are relative.' To put it into perspective, in our world today there is an affinity to denigrate young voices because of their lack of experience or they need to show respect. However, we forget that many of the voices that led to the Civil Rights Movement belonged to young people, especially for them to say, 'Enough.' Young people have been leaders and voices of change, and over time were proven that they were correct.\"\nThe panel discussed how they view the progress that has been made in the previous 60 years, and the challenges that they feel we still see face today.\n\"One of the greatest achievements of the Civil Rights Movement is the ability for people of diverse backgrounds to actually come together and actually have the opportunity to interact with one another,\" Tate said. \"It also gives many voices that have been marginalized and disenfranchised for much of the history of this country to have that opportunity to join in.\"\nBush asked how the Civil Rights Act of 1964 impacted the panelists' lives and those around them.\n\"I see it as a guarantee that I am valued pretty much in the workplace,\" said Tate, who interned at Historic Sotterley last year and is working on a St. Mary's Project adapting slave narratives into a graphic novel. \"And no matter what, I cannot be discriminated against, and if this does happen I have the backings of the legality and the government that this cannot stand.\"\n\"I immediately think to what type of opportunities my grandparents, my parents would have had if it wasn't for the Civil Rights Amendment, let alone the opportunities my siblings and I would have been able to have,\" said Lewis, who is a graduate of St. Mary's College of Maryland and a member of the St. Mary's NAACP. \"It really opened up society in many ways for Black Americans to have access to spaces that they were not allowed to be in before, so it was a major achievement in the struggle to advance civil rights in this country. It's really hard to think how life would be without it.\"\nBush welcomed Moaney to the conversation, whose appearance had been delayed by computer issues.\n\"Much like the theme for tonight's conversation is 'We Prevail,' I'm grateful to have gotten over those technical difficulties,\" said Moaney, who is a descendant of founding Black families in Kent and Talbot counties, and who was appointed by Gov. Wes Moore to the Maryland Commission on African American History & Culture.\nBush asked the panelists what challenges still exist in achieving true equity for all regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation or identities.\n\"We need to be very cautious about who we're speaking on behalf and for,\" Moaney said. \"I think there are so many well-intentioned people, eager people intent on joining those on the side of equality, but it is dangerous territory to be paraphrasing and even to the extent of appropriating. We still stand to benefit from hearing so many more voices, and I don't want us to leave this call thinking that solely precluded to those being elected.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Brian Hamilton tapped his microphone, signaling the beginning of his service at Westminster Presbyterian Church in honor of the 176th anniversary of the greatest attempted escape of enslaved people in American history — which happened in Washington.\"Resistance is a mandate then and now … you and I have a ton of work to do,\" Hamilton told the Sunday crowd.\nSeventy-seven enslaved men, women, and children made the abortive attempt on April 15, 1848, to flee the slave-holding District of Columbia for freedom in the North.\nThe church has been commemorating the event for four years.\nIt was a Saturday evening when the 77 enslaved people gathered to board a two-masted vessel called The Pearl. A formerly enslaved man named Daniel Bell drew up the escape plan after he and his wife lost a case to free their six children through the court system, according to the history YouTube channel CuriousPeople.\nBell contacted abolitionist Capt. Daniel Drayton, who agreed to lead the ship's journey and rounded up as many enslaved people as he could ahead of their departure. Full families snuck away from their plantations, beating Washington's 10 p.m. curfew for all Black residents, and boarded the ship.\nDrayton intended to sail down Washington's southwest waterfront and down the Potomac River to the Chesapeake Bay and break north to freedom, according to The Pearl Initiative, a Washington community group dedicated to spreading awareness about the escape.\nBut meager winds prevented the ship from sailing away to safety. Without the cover of darkness, The Pearl was spotted the following morning by a slaveholder who noticed several of his slaves were missing and overtook the ship with a mob on his steamboat Salem, according to CuriousPeople.\nThe 77 escapees were shackled, returned to Washington, and resold by their owners to Southern plantations. Many families were separated during the tragedy. Records detail the lives of a few after their capture.\nA woman named Grace Russell was among the captured. Her family saved her at an auction in Richmond, Virginia, but could not afford to save her sister, Emily, when she was sold two years later by the same person who enslaved Grace, according to The Pearl Initiative.\n\"Oh mother, my dear mother, come see your distressed and heartbroken daughter once more,\" wrote Emily Russell to her mother from Bruin Jail in Alexandria, Virginia. Emily Russell died soon after on a coffle traveling to the South.\nWestminster Presbyterian Church was founded in 1853, five years after The Pearl incident.\n\"This is extremely important for us because Westminster is totally committed to inclusion and diversity… So the Pearl project was a natural when we realized that this whole thing happened right in our backyard,\" Hamilton said.\nThe institution of the church historically has served as a forum for social justice initiatives and community-building for African Americans. Churches have played an instrumental role in mobilizing political action, such as during the civil rights movement.\nWashington native Sonia Adams brought her son Joseph to The Pearl remembrance so he could learn African American history. She had seen a brochure about the event at a local library.\n\"Social justice wouldn't be what it is without the African American church because that was our basis,\" Adams said. \"That was the framework for social justice here in America and continues to be. … It plays a role because you have community and the community is working together to solve this problem.\"\nThe story of The Pearl helped to fuel the abolitionist movement and inspired anti-slavery publications.\nAuthor and renowned abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe began her 1852 novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" as a series of installments in a Washington newspaper.\nWhile raising money to try to free members seized aboard The Pearl, Stowe produced a follow-up novel in 1854 called \"The Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" The book told stories of enslaved people, including those on The Pearl, to dispel national skepticism of the conditions she described in her previous novel.\nHamilton and The Pearl Initiative held a procession on Monday at Washington's southwest waterfront with community members to read the names of the passengers on The Pearl and toss flowers into the Potomac as a tribute.\nDr. Christopher Williams, a resident of the neighborhood and board member of The Pearl Initiative, said that during his time at the organization, people told him that they did not know the story of the escape attempt on the ship.\nWilliams said that the story of The Pearl invites Americans to \"return to their origin story.\"\n\"We cannot be that kind of society where we fail to remember. … Given how highly consequential The Pearl escape was, it would not be in our interest to forget and not be able to contextualize these historic figures,\" Williams said. \"If we become ignorant of history, who are we really? Do we really know who we are? Do we really know ourselves?\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Malkus led the Maryland opposition to defeat Maryland's 1962 Civil Rights bill, as proposed in the federal Civil Rights bill created to outlaw racial discrimination. This was the primary legislation outlining today's law of the land. When Malkus and a few other segregationists failed, he led the group to try to exempt individual counties from state legislation. Again, that failed, but in return, Malkus then tried to exempt bars from the accommodations portion of the bill.All of his various efforts to dilute the national and state civil rights bills failed, and the landmark national bill passed with the Maryland legislature complying.He publicly decried civil rights legislation of any kind as being \"un-American.\"He proposed a bill to provide criminal penalties for anyone claiming discrimination.He proposed a bill that would make it a crime to make false statements about a community — another unconstitutional act. He continually blamed the media and \"outsiders\" for all of Cambridge's troubles, without helping to correct its real economic and racial problems.He voted against the repeal of a state law forbidding interracial marriage.On national TV, he said Martin Luther King was a \"communist troublemaker\" and Gloria Richardson was a \"media-hungry agitator.\"He publicly supported Gov. George Wallace's bid for president in 1964.At a Goucher College televised conference with Gov. Wallace, he said, \"Cambridge's Nonviolent Action Committee employed the same tactics as Hitler.\"He sent a letter to President John Kennedy complaining that his attack by three black boys in Baltimore was not given as much news coverage as the shooting of Medgar Evers. This is the only letter on record to either President Kennedy or Attorney General Robert Kennedy addressing the issue of racial problems in Cambridge with an attempt to calm the issue – an odd letter for a state senator (of the same party), who never asked for federal assistance.\nCorrection: Gov. Hughes did not veto the building of the bridge – he vetoed naming the bridge after Sen. Malkus. The governor said: \"It didn't seem right for the bridge to be named after the state's staunchest segregationist.\"\nPATRICK HORNBERGER\nTrappe \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We had a lot of older generations that had a lot of knowledge of what happened and it was never told to the kids, so the kids never knew what was going on.\"\nThe event also included exhibits featuring historical and cultural institutions, authors, quilts and poetry.\n\"They're amazing. They're just so detailed,\" St. Mary's College North Campus Area Coordinator Meghan Pushee said as she gazed at story quilts. \"I love the collage aspect and the multi-media aspect. I'm in awe of them.\"\nLater, speakers took to the stage at the Nancy R. & Norton T. Dodge Performing Arts Center on campus.\n\"Now, more than ever we must expand this history in your voice, from your memory, from your attics, from your archives,\" Southern Maryland Equity in History Coalition Hugh Davies said. \"Let us commit to doing so to bring this history forward.\"\nThe event was dedicated to longtime Calvert County NAACP officer Malcolm Funn, who died in 2022.\n\"It has been said that before we can travel forward or even truly understand why we're here today, one must understand the past,\" Piscataway Conoy Tribe Tribal Chairman Francis Gray said. \"History is our willingness to connect the past to the present. It provides us with a sense of purpose, of who we are, a sense of being … and it's here that we all have the opportunity to obtain that knowledge. The Piscataway Conoy people are excited to have this opportunity to unearth the narrative of Maryland's history.\"\nSt. Mary's College Community Affairs Liaison Kelsey R. Bush read the land acknowledgement and pledge, while Southern Maryland Equity in History Coalition Steering Committee member Janice Walthour read her poem, \"Ancestors.\"\n\"My mother used to tell my sister and me, 'Actions speak louder than words.' She would also say, 'Beauty is as beauty does,' and today is beautiful,\" said author, performer, GU272+ descendent and keynote speaker Mélisande Short-Colomb. \"More information and more stories about Native American history and African American history will be unveiled. The ancestry and history of all … will be accessible to all. Our ancestors would be proud.\"\n\"Since all stories start at the beginning, we have started by working directly with the Piscataway people to see if this was a story they would trust to be told,\" Southern Maryland National Heritage Area Executive Director Lucille Walker said. \"That's why this particular initiative is so critical. Because why are we telling any stories if we're not telling the whole story? If we're not doing it for the next generation then what are we doing?\"\nThe coalition, which is administered by \"Big Conversation: Partners in Dismantling Racism and Privilege in Southern Maryland,\" which was started at Middleham and St. Peter's Episcopal Parish in Lusby, and is supported by public school systems, libraries, museums, colleges and churches.\nSt. Mary's College President Tuajuanda Jordan said the coalition \"is a testament to the realization that we have work to do to create and sustain an inclusive community free of racism and prejudice.\"\nFor more information or to see the new website, go to www.equityinhistory.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The display featured color-coded flags representing the groups of people who were killed in the Holocaust. It was approved by the university, and similar displays have been set up in previous years.\nWitnesses saw Kandeel damaging 10 flags and spitting on them. They also heard her say \"Fn n n the Jews,\" \"Jewish people are nasty, free Palestine\" and other vulgar statements, according to court documents.\nWitnesses called police, and dispatchers were able to use security cameras to watch the incident in realtime. Police responded and stopped Kandeel as she was walking away.\nKandeel told officers that she was \"frustrated and triggered\" by the Holocaust memorial and admitted to damaging the flags out of frustration, according to court documents.\nA resident of Pennsylvania, Kandeel has been banned from campus.\nUD reportedly mentioned the arrest in an email to students but did not disclose the incident publicly, as it typically does when there is a significant crime on campus.\nThe incident was not announced publicly until five days later, when Attorney General Kathy Jennings issued a statement condemning the antisemitic vandalism on Monday.\n\"We have a proud history of protecting free speech in this country, including and especially political dissent,\" Jennings said. \"But we need to be lucid enough to recognize the daylight — miles of it, in this case — between protest and hate. The Holocaust is not ancient history. Eighty years later, the world's Jewish population still has not recovered; its survivors are still with us; and I fear that we still have not learned its lessons. Seeing this ignorance on display, particularly in an increasingly antisemitic climate, should be a wake-up call. We still have work to do.\"\nA UD spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn April, an earlier display set up by Jewish students was vandalized three times within a 24-hour period. The final time, someone picked up all the flags and threw them in a trash can.\nThat display on the UD Green was intended to mark the six-month anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, in which Hamas militants killed more than 1,000 people and kidnapped hundreds more. It featured hundreds of tiny Israeli flags, some arranged to form a Star of David, as well as signs featuring photos of the hostages and the message \"Bring them home now.\"\nUD Police said that incident was investigated as a hate crime, but no arrests were announced.\nThe incidents at UD come as campuses nationwide deal with tensions related to the Israel-Hamas war. Many campuses have seen large protests by students condemning Israel, some of which have drawn accusations of antisemitism.\nAt UD, pro-Palestinian students held a march and a small, three-day \"occupation\" outside the Biden School of Public Policy and Administration last month, but it remained calm and peaceful. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Eighteen volleys of musket fire.\nThe men fought for the Union. They fought for freedom. Their freedom.\nThe 18 were Black Union soldiers who fought in the Civil War. They are buried in the cemetery behind St. Stephens AME Church in Unionville, the town named to honor their fight for freedom.\n\"Hearing the names is the best part,\" Pamela Roberts Price said. She has relatives in the graveyard.\nAround 70 people gathered at St. Stephens on a recent Sunday. There was a contingent of Union-garbed men with rifles, flags and shiny brass buckles.\nThe sounds of \"Amazing Grace\" drifted over gravestones that are worn by thousands of rainy days. A solo violin played \"Taps.\"\nSt. Stephens Pastor Eddie Scott opened the ceremony with a prayer. \"Comfort us in knowing that these soldiers that we stand on their shoulders, that we can have life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"\nHarriette Lowery has more than 10 relatives in the cemetery.\n\"I am related to one of the soldiers, definitely,\" she said. \"Benjamin Demby is my great-great-grandfather. My grandfather's mother was Agnes Demby Green. That was Benjamin's mother.\"\nLike Price, Lowery loves hearing the names.\n\"Every time I hear the names it gives me such pride,\" she said. \"Thinking about the chaos that is happening in our community or somewhere else, thinking about what they did, what they went through really touches me.\"\nShe noted that there were no promises to these soldiers.\n\"They did it hoping they would be free,\" Lowery said. \"They hoped they would get emancipation.\"\nShe noted some of the local Black soldiers traveled as far as Texas, and some of them had to walk from Texas to get home.\n\"I want the history to be told over and over again because not only do our young people, all races of young people, need to know what they went through,\" Lowery said. \"They sacrificed for us to do better. So don't give up on education and things like that. They need to know what people sacrificed.\"\nDan Cowgill of Middletown was master of ceremonies for the event. His ancestors were Quakers who donated the land for Unionville where freed slaves settled after the Civil War.\n\"We are honoring the 18 soldiers from the U.S. colored troops during the Civil War that created the town of Unionville,\" he said. \"It is amazing I still get choked up when I read these words.\"\nThe African American history within 10 miles of St. Stephens Church is remarkable. Not all of it is known or even written about. Sandy Johnson is working to change that.\n\"I am a budding historic preservationist,\" she said. \"It is good to honor those that came before us. It gives us a direction to know where we are going in life. Without the past you really can't move forward.\"\nThere were white participants in the crowd whose roots go way back too. Some of their relatives had owned big estates. Some have tilled this land for generations. A few got together to swap stories and show old black and white photographs. You could hear them saying old names too.\nThe Green Meadows Bluegrass Band finished playing \"Amazing Grace,\" the sounds of the music falling softly on the worn gravestones marked with the names of the Union soldiers — John Blackwell, Ennels Clayton, Isaac Copper, John Copper, Benjamin Demby, Charles Demby, William Doane, William Doran, Horace Gibson, Zachary Glasgow, Joseph Gooby, Joseph H. Johnson, Peter Johnson, Edward Jones, Enolds Money, Frederick Pipes, Henry Roberts and Mathew Roberts. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This was the first in-person meeting the Caucus of African American Leaders has held in Cambridge in four years.Over 60 people and a half dozen Maryland political leaders attended the meeting at the Harriet Tubman Cultural and Educational Center, where they discussed the caucus' involvement around the state and in matters concerning the Eastern Shore.\nCarl Snowden, convener of the caucus, spoke to the power of collective action in addressing civil rights issues. He pulled examples from history. Snowden said that the 13-month bus boycotts succeeded through collective activism, and the people were able to make sacrifices together and accomplish goals together.\nSnowden spoke of the bumblebees and the hornets to drive home the point. Though the bumblebee is bigger than the hornet, the hornet is by far more feared, he said.\n\"There can be a thousand bumblebees, and you can kill each bumblebee one at a time, but not a single bumblebee will do a thing. They just wait their turn,\" Snowden said. \"But if you put your hand on a hornet, every hornet in that mess will come out. They organize their collective. They understand when you touch one of us, you touch all of us.\"\nHe continued, \"The purpose of the Caucus of African American leaders is to make it crystal clear that … wherever Black people are, when you go to injure one of us, you're going to have all of us to deal with.\"\nSnowden encouraged attendees to join the Caucus of African American Leaders and be prepared to \"be like hornets to deal with an issue.\"\nIn the crowd, Snowden pointed out Kionte Williams-Taylor, who Snowden said had been beaten and, as a result, hospitalized by police in a Somerset County community last Saturday. According to Snowden, the case is being reviewed by the ACLU and involves a video of the incident.\n\"For those of you who don't know it, we have a young man among us who was the victim of police brutality,\" Snowden said to attendees. \"... according to what he told me, the police officer told him, 'Nobody can do anything about this. Nothing will be done.' He's about to experience what happens when hornets come together.\"\nRobert Johnson, a representative for the campaign to elect Angela Alsobrooks, spoke of the importance of working together as a community and looking closely at the systems that make communities fight each other and divide against each other.\nHe urged attendees to register to vote and take the time to be politically active.\n\"The biggest enemy against us right now is complacency and individuals saying that it doesn't matter,\" Johnson said. \"Do whatever it takes to get people off of the couch. And here, if they don't want to, if they're not thinking about the top of the ballot, politics of what? Local. Start local and work your way up.\"\nStudents were honored during the meeting for their academic high achievements and leadership. Those who earned recognition were Armani Black, Willoh Ryans, Aliyah Black and Tearra Brown.\nToward the end of the meeting, Carl Snowden spoke again. He expressed the importance of working together to rename the Frederick C. Malkus Bridge, which spans the Choptank River, in honor of Gloria Richardson, a civil rights activist and leader of the Cambridge Movement.\nSnowden stressed the importance of not waiting around for an official change by the government and that the collective power of the Black community has the power to effect change regardless of official documents. Snowden said about 50 years ago, in Washington, D.C., Black people decided to honor Malcolm X, an American revolutionary and human rights activist, by renaming Meridian Park after Malcolm X.\n\"Now, the government did not officially change it,\" Snowden said. \"The government didn't pass any resolution. The government didn't approve it. But Black people said, 'We want to remember Malcolm X,' and they named Meridian Park after Malcolm X. Well, I would request those of you here, when you cross the bridge and go into the bridge, just tell people you are going into the Gloria Richardson Bridge.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This family-friendly event had live music, drag queens, belly dancers, funnel cakes and 85 vendors, which filled Market Street.The festival received a proclamation from the Town of Denton that claimed June 1 as Pride Day. It said, in part, that Caroline County is a place that strives for inclusion and welcomes everybody.\nThe motto of the festival was \"Diversity Creates Community.\"\nAngel Perez, the founder of the festival, said, \"Pride represents an opportunity to raise awareness about diversity, inclusion and respect and the importance of a society based in equity. Pride Month reminds us we need to continue to fight for our rights to be included, to feel welcome and be respected as a human being.\"\nAfter marking the significance of the 1969 Stonewall Riots, which many see as the beginning of LGBTQ+ movement, he continued.\n\"We need to continue to educate our community, because a community where there are no labels, where each person respects their neighbors regardless of sexual orientation, will be a strong, united and thriving community. Together we can achieve it,\" Perez said.\nHe guessed that 500 people were milling around the vendors and the stage area. He expected around 1,000 visitors for the whole day.\nPerez wanted to emphasize the events's growth over the past few years.\n\"Our first year, we had 40 vendors. This year we have more than 85 vendors. The festival also serves to raise awareness and educate our community,\" Perez said.\nDavina Reign Escade, the reigning 2024 Miss Trans Maryland, took the stage and introduced Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller.\n\"We are going to build a state where no one gets left behind. What that means is that we want to make sure that every individual in the state of Maryland can live their authentic lives. They can love who they want to love, because love is love, right?\" Miller said.\nBefore taking the stage, Escade got a chance to talk with Miller for about 45 minutes.\n\"She invited me and the rest of the board of directors of Caroline Pride to take some students from the high schools and bring them over to meet the Governor and get their opinion on what they think they need in their community,\" Escade said.\nShe had a few ideas she said could improve the lives of youths in the LGBTQ+ community.\n\"I want to see more sensitivity training in our schools. And I would love to see more HIV care out there on the Eastern Shore. There is not a lot,\" Escade said. \"When I was 15, I contracted HIV. I have lived with it for almost 15 years now. It is very important that these kids know that there is someone to guide them. They are going to be ok. HIV positive is not a death sentence anymore. I am 15 years positive and I am thriving and healthy and beautiful. I am doing cartwheels at Pride.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That's what I was left with after listening to members of the Easton Town Council on June 3. What began as a purported \"budgetary issue\" quickly revealed itself to be a thinly veiled attempt to shutter our LGBTQ+ community. It was also a rather clumsy but obvious nudge toward a small-minded political agenda.If fiscal responsibility was the concern, the council would have recognized that the minor expense of printing banners for any community event is dwarfed by the significant revenue potential of nurturing a thriving diverse tourist demographic.\nWhat shortsighted local government would actively choose to send a message of exclusion to potential tourism demographics, effectively hanging a \"closed for business\" sign on our community? The actions of a few specific council members reek of political posturing, not financial prudence.\nThe Pride banners send a powerful and important message to all of our residents and visitors — that our community is willing to grow into a place of belonging, safety and inclusion for all. Period.\nDuring both council meetings this simple message was lost amid a tirade of inaccurate fear-mongering and the inappropriate insertion of personal lifestyle and medical choices into a conversation where they had no place. To foster greater understanding and inclusivity, we must be brave enough to ask and actively listen with respect for our fellow humans.\nUnderstanding our neighbors does not mean we must adopt their personal choices or even agree with them. It simply means having the human decency to listen and learn from one another and respect the differences. Only through open and honest communication can we work to grow a community of true inclusivity.\nTo our LGBTQ+ community members: Your experiences and perspectives are valued. Many of us are committed to creating a community where you feel welcomed, respected and supported.\nKudos to the community members who spoke to the issue at hand at the June 3 council meeting.

    "content": "Civil rights leader who preached nonviolent protest dies\n\n June 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 451\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n LOS ANGELES — The Rev. James Lawson Jr., an apostle of nonviolent protest who schooled activists to withstand brutal reactions from white authorities as the Civil Rights Movement gained traction, has died, his family said Monday. He was 95.His family said Lawson died on Sunday after a short illness in Los Angeles, where he spent decades working as a pastor, labor movement organizer and university professor.\nLawson was a close adviser to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who called him \"the leading theorist and strategist of nonviolence in the world.\"\nLawson met King in 1957, after spending three years in India soaking up knowledge about Mohandas K. Gandhi's independence movement. King would travel to India himself two years later, but at the time, he had only read about Gandhi in books.\nThe two Black pastors — both 28 years old — quickly bonded over their enthusiasm for the Indian leader's ideas, and King urged Lawson to put them into action in the American South.\nLawson soon led workshops in church basements in Nashville, Tennessee, that prepared John Lewis, Diane Nash, Bernard Lafayette, Marion Barry, the Freedom Riders and many others to peacefully withstand vicious responses to their challenges of racist laws and policies.\nLawson's lessons led Nashville to become the first major city in the South to desegregate its downtown, on May 10, 1960, after hundreds of well-organized students staged lunch-counter sit-ins and boycotts of discriminatory businesses.\nLawson's particular contribution was to introduce Gandhian principles to people more familiar with biblical teachings, showing how direct action could expose the immorality and fragility of racist white power structures.\nGandhi said \"that we persons have the power to resist the racism in our own lives and souls,\" Lawson told the AP. \"We have the power to make choices and to say no to that wrong. That's also Jesus.\"\nYears later, in 1968, it was Lawson who organized the sanitation workers strike that fatefully drew King to Memphis. Lawson said he was at first paralyzed and forever saddened by King's assassination.\n\"I thought I would not live beyond 40, myself,\" Lawson said. \"The imminence of death was a part of the discipline we lived with, but no one as much as King.\"\nStill, Lawson made it his life's mission to preach the power of nonviolent direct action.\n\"I'm still anxious and frustrated,\" Lawson said as he marked the 50th anniversary of King's death with a march in Memphis. \"The task is unfinished.\"\nCivil rights activist Diane Nash was a 21-year-old college student when she began attending Lawson's Nashville workshops, which she called life-changing.\n\"His passing constitutes a very great loss,\" Nash said. \"He bears, I think, more responsibility than any other single person for the civil rights movement of Blacks being nonviolent in this country.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "NAACP calls for 'swift and decisive action' after Zoombombing of council meeting\n\n June 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 892\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Newark NAACP is calling on city council to take \"swift and decisive action\" in response to an incident last month in which a council meeting was interrupted by online provocateurs yelling racial slurs.\"The Newark, Delaware, NAACP branch stands in unwavering support of Councilwoman Dwendolyn Creecy, who was subjected to racial slurs, a hate crime, during a recent public meeting,\" said the Rev. Blaine Hackett, pastor of St. John AM Church and vice president of the local NAACP chapter. \"Such abhorrent language has no place in our city discourse and only serves to divide our community.\"\nAddressing city council Monday night, he asked the city to launch a thorough investigation, prosecute the culprits to fullest extent of the law and implement stricter protocols to prevent a similar incident from occurring.\n\"We call on the city council to forcefully condemn this reprehensible behavior and take all necessary steps to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all participants in public meetings,\" Hackett said. \"The Newark branch of the NAACP also urges the entire community to reject racism and discrimination in all its forms.\"\nThe incident happened during the May 13 council meeting.\nTwo people participating virtually through the Microsoft Teams online teleconferencing platform unmuted their microphones during a presentation by a University of Delaware representative and suddenly began yelling racist remarks. The comments, which included the n-word, were audible to everyone attending the meeting in person as well as online.\nThe incident is an example of so-called Zoombombing, which became common early on in the pandemic when many meetings switched to Zoom and other similar platforms. Provocateurs find public Zoom links and then crash government meetings, college lectures and even elementary school classes to disrupt them with offensive comments and explicit images. Incidents are often coordinated through online forums and message boards.\nIn April 2020, the FBI warned that Zoombombing is far from a harmless prank and could lead to criminal charges, including disrupting a public meeting, computer intrusion, using a computer to commit a crime, hate crimes, fraud or transmitting threatening communications. However, prosecuting the perpetrators can prove difficult, as many mask their IP addresses and may not even be located in the U.S.\nDuring the May 13 meeting, Mayor Jerry Clifton quickly condemned the comments and then briefly stepped down from the dais and conferred with a police officer providing security at the meeting.\n\"I can tell you that this government and this public body absolutely finds comments like that to be absolutely abhorrent,\" Clifton said. \"No one in this government endorses or agrees with that kind of comment and language. I want to tell the people online and the people here, on behalf of the seven of us on city council and our staff, that we're sorry that happened. We're sorry you had to hear that.\"\nOn Monday, Clifton said that incident remains an ongoing investigation and the Newark Police Department is working with \"higher level\" law enforcement agencies in an attempt to track down the perpetrators.\n\"As soon as they determine whatever they're going to determine from the investigation, when it's appropriate to do so, it will be made public,\" he said.\nLt. Andrew Rubin, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department, confirmed there is still an active investigation into the incident but had no further information to share.\nThe city also changed the way it handles virtual participants in meetings.\n\"The way it was set up was everybody's microphone, when they were online, was enabled, and we were trusting them to stay muted until it was their time to talk,\" City Solicitor Paul Bilodeau said. \"After that, the big change we made is everybody that's online now, their microphone is disabled and will not be allowed to be used at all unless we physically enable it from here. That hopefully should avoid what happened on the 13th. And if somebody does make comments like that, we'll know exactly who they are when it happens.\"\nHackett asked council to go a step farther and stop allowing virtual participation, which has been a mainstay of public meetings since the pandemic.\n\"We truly believe that Zoom should be shut down until we get this matter settled,\" he said.\nCreecy, who is the first and only Black woman to be elected to municipal government in Newark, thanked the many NAACP members and other residents who packed into council chambers to show support for her Monday night.\n\"Thank you so much for coming and supporting me in this situation,\" Creecy said. \"That day was one of the loneliest days here for me.\"\nMara Gorman, a Newark resident, told Creecy and the other council members that she felt it was important for residents to speak out.\n\"I just want you to know, Councilwoman Creecy, that although you felt so lonely in that moment, you are not alone. I'm a big believer that the work of anti-racism is an unending process for white people,\" Gorman said. \"I think it is our responsibility to stand up and show the ways that we are allies.\"\n\"It's our responsibility to make sure that a person who is the victim of a situation like this, of a crime like this, does not feel alone,\" she added. \"I can't understand exactly how you felt, but I appreciate how terrible that must have been for you and I'm deeply sorry. I personally will continue to work in my community in Newark to make sure that nothing like that happens again.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It also has drop-in hours on Tuesdays and Saturdays.\n\"We have all types of activities from socials to support groups to game nights,\" O'Donnell said. \"And we just want to have positive, family-friendly activities for people to come out and meet other queer people in the community and know that there is a home for them on Delmarva.\"\nEvents for the center include arts and crafts evenings, parents and allies groups on Saturdays, tabletop games, monthly social events at different locations, movie days, weekend coffee chats, and Dungeons and Dragons nights.\nO'Donnell said the Dungeons and Dragons game nights were a great example of listening to community members. The game was a great way for people to engage in good fellowship together, to engage imagination and creativity and to think of who their ideal hero or champion would look like.\nFor members of Delmarva Pride Center like Rebecca Hutchinson, the center has given her a community of people who know what it's like to be LGBTQ+ while living in a conservative community.\n\"I can go to their events and know that I am safe, and I can be myself,\" Hutchinson said. \"I know that I have emotional support if needed.\"\nHutchinson said she grew up on the Eastern Shore and now works as a mental health clinician. She has informed her clients, who are LGBTQ+ and seeking community, about the events and support groups that Delmarva Pride has.\nThis includes a Gender Expression Movement meeting every month hosted at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship in Easton. This support group is for those who are exploring or identifying anywhere along the gender spectrum.\nO'Donnell said the Elder and Intergenerational Social has been included on their calendar, an event to gather LGBTQ+ members from all generations to share their stories, experiences and wisdom.\nAccording to O'Donnell, this event allows people to talk and learn how society has grown over time and what still needs to be resolved.\nHutchinson said that throughout her life as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, it has meant so much to her to have a center that provides the kind of support she sought as a native of the area.\n\"I grew up here, and I know what it was like to not see anyone that I thought was like me,\" Hutchinson said. \"I didn't have any person or place to help me understand what I was struggling to figure out.\"\n\"Because of the Pride centers, there is representation, visibility, fun events and support available to anyone trying to figure out who they are or wanting to be around people who understand some of their experiences,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Stitched together: Old-Fashioned Independence Day Picnic on Saturday, July 6\n\n June 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: NIAMBI DAVIS Special to the Bay Times Record Observer / Star Democrat | Section: Entertainment \n \n 618\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On July 6, the Queen Anne's County Historical Society will host an \"Old-Fashioned Independence Day Picnic\" at Wright's Chance, 119 S. Commerce Street in Centreville. The event will feature s'mores by the fire pit, music by the Chesapeake Bay Community Band, and an opportunity to learn and celebrate the success of Bryan's United Methodist Church to preserve a significant piece of Queen Anne's County history.Chris Pupke, former Queen Anne's Historical Society President, and Kay Brown, Grasonville resident and member of Bryan's United Methodist Church will share church history and good news about the grant awarded to the church by the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture and the Maryland Historical Trust's African American Heritage Preservation Program.\nFor Pupke and Brown, this work grew from their desire to share the story of local United States Colored Troops and African American history in Queen Anne's County. Pupke pored through records of the National Archives, particularly for USCT muster roles and military records. He contacted Drew University's National Methodist Archives and History Center, the Maryland State Archives, and Delaware's Barrett's Chapel. His research led to more than one dated cornerstone, to 200-year-old hand-hewn beams, and \"a tantalizing clue\" from a document that Pupke has yet to find. The historical hint dates the church back to 1800; the land was given to the congregation by the Bryan family, large landowners with holdings that stretched from the location of Bryan's Church over to the Wye River.\nFrom its beginning, Bryan's United Methodist Church has been a focal point of service and community activism. The community hall made the church a place of worship and community gathering. The church was home to a chapter of the Order of The Galilean Fisherman, a mutual aid society based in Baltimore that provided health benefits and funeral costs when insurance was unavailable to African Americans. In 1866, the congregation established a school later replaced by a Rosenwald School.\nFor Brown, the mission began after meeting Pupke. \"After I heard the history of my church and learned of the USCT soldiers, I took a walk in what is practically my backyard. And there they were. I wanted to get the word out to the larger community,\" she recalled. With no experience, she undertook the challenge with Pupke's assistance. \"I was just turning 50 and it was the first time I'd ever written a grant,\" Brown said, recalling the questions that needed answers and the forms to be filled out. \"It was a labor of love and I'm honored to have done it. I still get goosebumps when I think about it. I stand on the shoulders of very strong women — my mother, Barbara Brown who attended the March on Washington; my grandmother Geneva Brown, who was NAACP secretary, and the late Bertha Emory, my godmother and principal of Grasonville Elementary School.\"\nBut Pupke and Brown want more historical recognition for the African American citizens of Queen Anne's County. \"There is no official recognition of our history,\" Brown insists. To her point, Pupke notes that out of the County's 29 state historical markers, only one mentions African Americans in any capacity. \"It's a marker that praises the action of an enslaver who manumitted a number of the enslaved. He deserves some praise for his actions to be sure, but that should not be the only reference to African-American history in Queen Anne's County.\"\nBrown and Pupke's work is part of an ongoing effort to bring to the fore a history that should no longer be hidden or ignored. \"History can weave us together when it's done at its best,\" he believes. \"I hope we can put a stitch in the history of Queen Anne's County that will weave us together. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dirksen: A champion in advancing civil rights\n\n June 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 793\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On June 19 every year, Americans observe Juneteenth. It is a civil rights milestone in remembrance of an order issued in Texas in 1865 to enforce Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.Nearly a century later another civil rights milestone occurred in the United States Senate.\nIn the early morning hours of June 11, 1964, senators approved a cloture motion that effectively ended further debate on legislation to extend civil, political and legal rights to Black Americans. It was one of the most meaningful pieces of civil rights legislation since the 12-year Reconstruction Era immediately following the end of the American Civil War.\nToday a largely forgotten unsung hero on that issue was conservative Republican Sen. Everett McKinley Dirksen of Illinois. At the time, Dirksen was the minority floor leader.\nIn February 1964, the U.S. House approved a civil rights bill originally proposed by former President Kennedy. The bill immediately encountered fierce opposition primarily, but not exclusively, from Democratic U.S. senators from Southern states. Unable to kill the bill in the House, their strategy was simple — ensure there would not be 67 senators to vote for cloture to close off debate on the House bill and ensure there would not be a majority of senators to vote aye on passage of the House bill if that bill ever did make it to the Senate floor.\nEarly in the debate, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Kike Mansfield and Democratic Sen. Hubert Humprey (the floor leader on the bill) reached the same conclusion — Republican Sen. Dirksen would be a pivotal player in providing enough Republican votes to end the debate and pass the bill.\nMansfield said candidly and prophetically, \"The key is Dirksen.\"\nPrior to his assassination, Democratic President Kennedy concurred with that assessment. Democratic President Johnson did as well after succeeding Kennedy.\nInitially, Dirksen could only guarantee that 12 to 14 of his 33 Republicans would join with 41 Democratic senators. Even with those combined votes, proponents of the bill were still short of the votes necessary to shut down the opposition efforts led by Southern Democratic senators.\nDirksen soon rose to the occasion. He was the right man in the right place, at the right time.\nDirksen was a pragmatic politician and took the \"big view\" of his position as Senate minority Leader. He knew taking hard line partisan stances would not be good for America.\nDirksen also knew that the bill as written when it passed the House was dead on arrival in the Senate.\nUndaunted by long odds and despite serious health issues, Dirksen rewrote the bill with the help of several legal experts. Together they came up with almost 70 amendments all designed to fashion a bill that could get enough votes in the Senate to end a filibuster, get enough votes to be approved in the Senate, get enough votes in the House to concur with the Senate version of the original House bill, and be signed into law by the president.\nDirksen's revised bill was not a perfect bill. None ever are. It did honor the timeless approach for progress in the legislative arena — acknowledging that success ultimately results from focusing on the art of the possible.\nOn June 10, 1964, Dirksen's strategy was put to test. Immediately after the original House bill was brought forward for Senate debate and consideration, West Virginia's Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd launched a speech in opposition. That speech lasted over 14 hours. Following Byrd was Georgia's Democratic Sen. Richard Russell, a decades long leader of Southern states opposition to federal civil rights legislation.\nEventually Dirksen spoke on his revised bill. He put country first and political party second.\nDirksen said, \"The time has come for equality of opportunity in sharing in government, in education and in employment. It will not be stayed or denied. It is here.\" For emphasis, he included Victor Hugo's quote: \"Stronger than all the armies is an idea whose time has come.\"\nDirksen's amendment strategy, his unwavering commitment to doing the right thing and his eloquence worked.\nTwenty-three Republican senators voted to close debate. They also voted for his bill resulting in a final approval vote of 71 ayes and only 29 nays. Given that level of Senate support the House quickly agreed to Dirksen's version of their original bill.\nOn July 2, 1964, President Johnson signed the bill that banned discrimination in public facilities, provided voting rights protection and established equal opportunity as the law of the land.\nTime magazine (coincidentally published on June 19, 1964), included Dirksen's picture and the following observation on their front cover: \"The Civil Rights Bill Product of Principle and Compromise.\"\nWith all due respect to Juneteenth, I suggest June is also an appropriate time to ensure Everett Dirksen is not forgotten as a champion in advancing civil rights in America.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Rabbi Hyman delivers multicultural understanding\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: News \n \n 705\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Easton has been and is blessed with an extraordinarily number of exceptionally talented individuals engaged in a wide range of community service endeavors.One of them is Rabbi Peter Hyman DD (Doctor of Divinity) who is retiring in October after serving 18 years as the first full-time rabbi at Easton's Temple B'nai Israel.\nRabbi Hyman has a long history in walking his talk on promoting greater understanding of and respect for individuals with different religious beliefs and different faith journeys.\nThere is no more enduring symbol of Rabbi Hyman's commitment to respect for other religious beliefs than a Persian rug he bought in Israel 40 years ago. It is now on display in his office. That rug includes 99 names of God in Arabic. Rabbi Hyman views it as a metaphorical bridge connecting people of different faiths.\nHe once asked the leaders of a mosque if they could help him translate some of the Arabic words on his rug. They did so, amazed that such an inclusive rug was owned and displayed by a rabbi.\nFor Rabbi Hyman, it was simply his belief that \"building relationships not only creates friendships, but they also cement ties.\"\nA partial list of his local efforts to improve the quality of life in our community and beyond, includes serving as a member, program vice president and president of the Talbot Association of Clergy and Laity. He received an Award of Appreciation for Outstanding and Inspiring Interfaith Work in Talbot County for a Temple B'nai Israel February Lecture Series: \"Introduction to Islam.\"\nHe was a recipient of the NAACP Dorothy Webb Black Community Service Legacy Award and a recipient of a Governor William Donald Schaefer Helping People Award. He was a member of The Frederick Douglass Celebration Committee and delivered the sermon at the Community Interfaith Worship Celebration, which was a part of the \"Douglass Returns\" statue dedication.\nAn author and teacher, he served as a presenter and instructor at Chesapeake College's Institute for Adult Learning and collaborated with Bishop Joel Marcus Johnson to launch a \"Downtown Lunch and Learn\" program. He was elected to the board of directors at the YMCA of the Chesapeake and appointed chair of the board at the Easton YMCA.\nSupport for Scouting has been a huge part of Rabbi Hyman's life since he earned his Eagle Scout award, as did his two sons. That is an achievement that has been earned by only 6% of all Scouts since 1912.\nHe has served as a scoutmaster and a chaplain at Scout World Jamborees in Thailand, England, Sweden and Japan and a National Jamboree in the United States. He was the first national chair for the Messengers of Peace Program, BSA, after having served as a national chair of the Jewish Committee on Scouting and as national Jewish chaplain — Boy Scouts of America. He was the keynote speaker at a national annual meeting of the BSA \"Duty to God Breakfast\" in Washington, D.C.\nHe is a recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award for distinguished service to youth awarded by the National Council of Boy Scouts of America. He is also a recipient of the Bronze Wolf Award, which is the Scouts' highest honor. It is presented by the World Scout Committee to recognize the service, commitment and contributions of volunteers to the Scout movement. Not surprisingly Hyman received the award for his interfaith activities and his lifelong commitment to \"building bridges between people and nations.\"\nRabbi Hyman represented the BSA in Saudi Arabia at Saudi Nation Day when they received an award for the work of the BSA with the Messengers of Peace Program. This program promotes service projects through social media in effort to achieve world peace.\nHyman recalls that trip as the most amazing experience of his life because he was welcome in a Muslim country.\nWhile the news of Rabbi Hyman's impending retirement is bittersweet, there is some good news.\nHe is not planning to leave the Eastern Shore.\nWhether he stays here for the short term or long term, one thing is certain. He has made countless selfless contributions to help make Easton, Talbot County, and our world a better place.\nEach one of them has earned Rabbi Hyman a well-deserved thank you and Godspeed.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant based in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium — the prime ingredient in heroin and other opiates.\nThe Taliban seized $7 billion worth of U.S. weapons and military vehicles and systems after the American retreat. More than 2,400 American troops died during the war and occupation and there more than 221,000 deaths overall, according to Uppsala University in Sweden.\nA U.S. State Department inspector general's report last month said the U.S. may have mistakingly sent as much as $293 million in foreign aid to the Taliban after the 2021 withdrawal.\nSince regaining power, the Taliban have put in place restrictive Sharia Law based on Islamic rules aimed at women and girls, including requiring full coverings of women's faces and bodies.\n\"Taliban have issued more than eighty edicts targeting the twenty million women and girls who make up just short of 50 percent of Afghanistan's population. Women and girls face draconian restrictions in public life, namely, on education, employment, access to the justice system, and activities and travel outside the home. These include prohibitions on education beyond sixth grade, veiling and dress codes enforceable by the morality police, and bans on leaving the house without a mahram, a male relative chaperone,\" the Council on Foreign Relations in a summary of the regime's actions.\n\"Afghanistan's Taliban rulers have issued a ban on women's voices and bare faces in public under new laws approved by the supreme leader in efforts to combat vice and promote virtue.\"\nThe new bans on women's voices and bare faces in were handed down last month after they were approved by supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada. The Taliban set up a ministry for the \"propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice\" after regaining power in 2021.\nThe U.S. State Department also criticized the Taliban's actions.\n\"The Taliban's relentless, discriminatory edicts and extreme policies are unparalleled and self-defeating. We have made clear to them in the last three years that they have a forked road ahead. If they respect the rights of the Afghan people and abide by Afghanistan's normative obligations, that is the road to reintegration into the international community. But the path the Taliban are pursuing is the same approach that made them a pariah in the 1990s. Their institutionalized campaign targeting women and girls constitutes gender persecution. The world is losing patience,\" said Rina Amiri, the U.S. Special Envoy for Afghan Women, Girls, and Human Rights. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The tests discriminated against candidates while failing to \"meaningfully distinguish between applicants who can and cannot perform the position of Trooper,\" according to a Department of Justice press release.\n\"Discrimination in any form has no place within the Maryland State Police, and it will not be tolerated,\" Col. Roland Butler Jr., superintendent of MDSP, told the board Wednesday. \"We're committed to making meaningful and lasting change … [and] to develop new policies and procedures that ensure equitable treatment for all applicants.\"\nThe board — made up of Gov. Wes Moore, state Comptroller Brooke Lierman and Treasurer Dereck E. Davis — signed off on the settlement. The agreement must also be approved by a federal court before moving forward.\nIn response to the investigation, MDSP will change its current testing methods to prevent future discrimination in hiring, but the new practices will not be ready until after the next two MDSP classes start, Butler said. To adapt, he said, MDSP intends to change existing standards, including eliminating time requirements from different portions of the physical fitness tests.\nMembers of the Board of Public Works raised concerns about this interim period, with Davis questioning whether the unclear guidelines would lead to more discrimination.\n\"Now it becomes subjective, so doesn't that lend itself, potentially, to be more discriminatory?\" Davis asked. \"Now we don't know what's good or what's not as it relates to that time.\"\nButler assured Davis that strict monitoring of who passes and fails the tests would be in place, allowing MDSP to monitor areas of improvement.\n\"We won't have the other test in place at this time,\" Butler said. \"However, we're relaxing the standards that we have … We will be allowed to use those tests under the condition that we provide strict monitoring to see what the results are, to see who's passing, who's failing and we do think that we'll get a larger pool of applicants when we start to look at how we measure that test and how we evaluate it.\"\nOfficials said the new tests would emphasize fairness while maintaining safety requirements, including a test that would receive ongoing validation to guarantee it was modern, fair and relevant, as well as an aptitude test to look for integrity, self-motivation, critical thinking and judgment skills.\nThe settlement involved 48 Black and female individuals who were prevented from becoming state troopers due to the discriminatory practices, according to Butler.\nSince his appointment in 2023, Butler said, he has worked to evaluate and modernize the agency's practices.\n\"I remain steadfastly committed to cultivating a culture that will ensure inclusiveness,\" Butler said, \"one that allows the fulfillment of our mission, of values centered around integrity, fairness, and service.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We wanted to take it a step further and let (podcast host) Tony (Anthony Cohen), as a historian, interpreter, interview other people and to really dive into these issues.\"\nThe podcast's first series was released in September, and it showed three different perspectives about the Underground Railroad.\n\"The first three episodes, Tony talks with a filmmaker, a nonprofit leader and a wildlife photographer,\" Lauren Giordano, a podcast producer, said. \"So getting those perspectives on the history and how that shows up for them and their work, in their lives, I think was something that was kind of unique about that.\"\nBut the podcast is not completely divorced from the natural, geography-based perspective of the film it's based off of.

Their way to learn this history, the producers said, is through Rooted Wisdom.\n\"My background is in the history of the Underground Railroad, and as a Marylander, starting 30 years ago, I came to realize how much of that history played out on the Eastern Shore,\" Cohen said. \"Not only Tubman and Douglas, but many of the abolitionists of the 1830s and whatnot had Maryland roots, and so the history is really anchored there.\"\n\"So I was involved in the community, and of some of those efforts which led to the establishment of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway, the 123-mile route through Dorchester and Caroline counties that roughly follows her route.\"\nAlthough the Rooted Wisdom podcast is Maryland-based, the plan is to expand. The producers and host believe that the podcast can give everyone a perspective from their own personal community with the history of the Underground Railroad.\n\"I think all of the podcasts that we've done and that we're envisioning or planning are really partly focused on a sense of place,\" Cohen said. \"So I think as we travel around the state and eventually around the country doing this story, we'll be bringing, or bringing to light, a story that itself is often underground, and I think that'll be powerful for people.\"\nTo listen to the podcast, visit rootedwisdom.org/podcast. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some 855 women came from across the U.S. to process mail in the European theater of war.\nThey were a twice-segregated unit, as women served separately from men at the time, and women of color served separately from white women.\nThe film release prior to Christmas has reanimated discussion of the unit, bringing their accomplishments into public consciousness. For descendants and family members, it's a culmination of a multi-year effort to bring awareness to their family's military service.\nTaylor, a 78-year-old retired dental hygienist, points to her living room wall lined with pictures of family members in her Catonsville apartment. Several items, including pictures, a U.S. flag, a certificate and a movie poster indicate a connection to the 6888th.\n\"These women were fighting for us,\" Taylor said, \"Even if someone tells you you can't do something, you don't let it go at that. You keep on going and prove that you can.\"\nTaylor says that's how her mother raised her.\nTaylor's mother, Vivian Elzie Taylor, was one of 19 women who enlisted in Maryland and deployed with the 6888th. After serving in Europe and meeting and marrying her husband, Elyseo J. Taylor, in Paris, she settled in Salisbury, Maryland.\nShe and her husband, a tanker in the first Black tank battalion, eventually divorced. Elzie Taylor went to teach art at the all-Black Salisbury High School in Maryland's then-segregated school system.\nFrom a segregated army to a segregated school system, Elzie Taylor's mid-century career was emblematic of the challenges Black women faced in Maryland and around the country.\nShe passed a lesson on to her daughter about persevering in the face of obstacles.\n\"My mom pushed me,\" Taylor said. \"She made me.\"\nAfter her mom died, Taylor began exploring the military oral history her mother had shared with her. It wasn't just her mother who served. Taylor's aunt, Marian Elzie Wilson, enlisted in Pennsylvania and also deployed with the 6888th.\nThe more she learned, she said, the more she understood the groundbreaking territory the group charted.\nAnd she wasn't the only one.\nVashti Murphy Matthews, from Baltimore's multi-generational publishing family of AFRO American Newspaper, also served overseas with the 6888th.\nShe was a taciturn woman who — despite a drill sergeant-like leadership style — never spoke about her time in the army, according to her daughter, Betty Schuler.\n\"Had it not been for me finding some pictures, we would never have known that she served at all,\" said Schuler. \"Not one word did she speak.\"\nSchuler and her cousin first learned about the 6888th when a monument was being erected in honor of the unit. Researchers and fundraisers were reaching out to descendants and media organizations, which led them to Schuler and her cousin, Frances Murphy Draper, CEO and publisher of the family business.\nThe Buffalo Soldier Educational and Historical Committee created a monument for the 6888th in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, outside of Kansas City, in 2018.\nA few years later, Congress passed legislation awarding the unit the Congressional Gold Medal. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore even designated March 9 as a day honoring the 6888th in Maryland.\nBut it wasn't until the movie that the unit really caught people's attention. Draper compares the Six Triple Eight to other overlooked stories about people of color.\n\"I think it also speaks to the 'argument' about the need to really teach African American history,\" said Draper. \"There's a whole history of people, and the more we understand about people … the more we understand that we have more in common than we have different.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast and Observance, urged attendees to remain steadfast in their pursuit of justice. The event, originally delayed by snow, brought together community members committed to honoring King's legacy of resilience and activism.\nSponsored by Minary's Dream Alliance, the Chester Valley Minister's Association, and Washington College's Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience, the Feb. 1 event was well attended, with around 150 people gathering in solidarity against racism and injustice.\nFollowing breakfast at Hodson Dining Hall, the program featured music, poetry, and an inspiring address by Beck, owner of Beck Excellence and a diversity, equity, and inclusion facilitator. He emphasized the importance of perseverance, telling the audience, \"Pivot, don't panic.\"\nCo-Executive Directors of Minary's Dream Alliance, Doncella Wilson and Paul Tue III, highlighted the event's theme: \"Mission Possible: Protecting Freedom, Justice, and Democracy in the Spirit of Nonviolence365.\" Wilson and Tue, drawing inspiration from the King Center in Atlanta, Georgia, encouraged attendees not to lose hope even in challenging times.\nTue, a football coach, used a sports analogy to illustrate the need for action. While his role is typically on defense, he urged the audience to go on offense against policies that threaten rights and freedoms at both local and federal levels.\nBeck expanded on Tue's sentiments, acknowledging the weight of unkept promises and progress under siege. Quoting King, he reminded listeners that \"injustice anywhere is a threat everywhere.\" He urged people to resist panic and instead pivot toward collective action, reinforcing that freedom is not merely an individual right but a shared responsibility.\nThe program began with Amiya Potts of New Life Community Methodist Church leading the audience in \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" a hymn written by NAACP leader James Weldon Johnson in 1900. Washington College President Mike Sosulski welcomed attendees and paid tribute to the late Rev. Jethroe Moore II, a civil rights leader dedicated to youth advocacy. Sosulski called on the audience to reflect on the sacrifices made for freedom in 1860, 1960, and to envision what it must look like in 2060.\nLaMonte Cooke, warden of Queen Anne's County's Department of Corrections and recipient of the Maryland Association of Counties' Service Award, read a proclamation on behalf of the Kent County Commissioners, officially declaring Jan. 20, 2025, as Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\nThe Chester River Voices, led by Assistant Director Stephanie LaMotte, performed the traditional African American spiritual \"Soon-a-will Be Done,\" followed by Clare Harner's poem \"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep.\" Washington College students also showcased their talents: Zhanglin You delivered a moving piano performance, while Ayanna-Jalen Harris captivated the audience with her rendition of Rihanna's \"Lift Me Up.\"\nA highlight of the event was the presentation of the Commissioner William W. Pickrum Service Award to Tilise Brown, a dedicated advocate for Kent County youth. Brown, the school counseling secretary at Kent County High School, also serves as the coordinator for the Achieving Academic Equity and Excellence for Black Boys Initiative, a former Kent County Spartans Cheer Commissioner, and the planner of the senior awards ceremony.\nKent County High School Principal Kris Hemstetter, who presented the award, praised Brown's transformative impact over the past seven years. \"She is a powerful force for good, a mentor, guide, and relentless advocate for students,\" Hemstetter said.\nBrown, moved by the honor, expressed gratitude to her mother, grandmother, daughter, and husband for their support. She reflected on her journey, recalling how an injury derailed her dream of cheering for the Baltimore Ravens. However, she found fulfillment in mentoring and leading young people in her community, demonstrating resilience in the face of setbacks.\n\"I will be forever grateful to be in this community,\" Brown said, closing with a King quote urging leaders to prioritize justice over wealth.\nThe celebration continued with a performance by the MLK Steppers, a group of youth girls who executed intricate cheer routines, including a step-up shoulder stand set to Beyoncé's \"Crazy in Love.\"They were trained by Brown, LaToya Johnson, Nichole Blake and Taliyah Russell.\nNext, a historically Black fraternity Omega Psi Phi, specifically the Psi Nu Nu Chapter, followed with a presentation of their Achievement Week honorees.\nBefore concluding, Tue rallied the audience to remain engaged. \"Now is the time to stay in tune with local politics, galvanize, organize, strategize, and then execute,\" he said. \"Let's not cower—let's be courageous, and we will get through it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Patterson II, a Democrat, last June sought to rename Black History Month — a recognition that was passed by Congress in 1986.\n\"The reason is, looking back at all the wonderful months we have where they celebrate all different heritages, February is the only month that has \"history\" in the name,\" Patterson said at the June 25, 2024, meeting of the commissioners.\nHe sought to rename the month to \"African American Heritage Month,\" at least locally.\n\"Black History Month never got the same recognition that the other months have received,\" Patterson said at the time. \"We have Asian American, Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Native American Heritage Month, Arab American Heritage Month, so on and so forth.\"\nNow, the results of months of surveying are in, and a good number of Charles County residents were not on board with the name change.\nA majority of the respondents to surveys were in the 45 to 54 age group and the 55 to 64 age group, which each contained just over 28% of participants.\nLow engagement was received from residents ages 34 and under. Just over 2% of participants were in the 25 to 34 age group and just under 3% of participants were in the 18 to 24 age group.\nFive meetings were conducted in person about the topic, with at least one in each county district.\nIn a summary presented Tuesday by Renesha Miles, the chief equity officer for the county, several key findings were summarized.\nThe majority of participants did not support the proposed name change, concerns were raised about how and why the name change was brought up and many participants felt that \"Black History Month\" is a more inclusive term, capturing the contributions and experiences of Black people from various backgrounds, including those from the Caribbean, Latin America and other regions outside of Africa.\nConcerns echoed Commissioner Amanda Stewart's (D) comments when the topic first arose.\nStewart said last year, \"Some folks identify as Black, some folks take offense when someone calls them African American. ... I respect everyone's position. I'm not offended if someone calls me Black, I'm not offended if someone calls me African American. I've heard people say, 'I'm not from Africa, so I'm not African American.'\"\nSome participants in favor of the change referenced the importance of recognizing history, heritage and present accomplishments related to African American culture.\n\"I know at this point, I'm not willing to move forward on this,\" Patterson said.\nThe commissioners settled with a consensus that the name change was not something to move forward with; no vote was conducted. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If the person is approved after these steps, they will need to take the Oath of Allegiance at a naturalization ceremony.\nWaite said she believes the process costs about $800 to complete.\nAt the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, Waite and other volunteers help prepare those with green cards who want to obtain citizenship. She said volunteers help go over the Form N-400 application, review questions that could be on the test and practice reading and writing.\nWaite said the citizenship test includes an English portion and also asks questions about democracy, the constitution, history and geography.\nOffering some of the more difficult questions to the audience at the event, Waite said the people she works with come in for about 10 weeks to review questions and practice English.\n\"They learn a lot more than I think my nephew, who went to high school and college, could probably know,\" she said, causing people in the audience to laugh.\nClaudia White-Cooke and Joyce Dowling, who attended Waite's presentation, said after hearing some of the questions on the test, they weren't sure if they'd be able to pass it. White-Cooke said the process to become a citizen seems complicated and the people who apply are really committed.\nWhen one person at the event asked if the new presidential administration has affected the naturalization process at all, Waite — who said she is not an expert on what's happening at the national level — said she did notice a change in priority for legal entry into the U.S. from Venezuela.\n\"To a limit, a certain number of people from Venezuela were being given entry legally and now that's stopped,\" she said.\nWaite said she believes the naturalization process in the U.S. will continue, however. She said people still want to be American citizens.\n\"And I and others will do what we can to help,\" she said.\nThose who are interested in volunteering with the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center or want to learn more can call 877-772-9832 or visit chesmrc.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We further understand that this may be done in a way that flies below the radar, without input — perhaps to push a political agenda without public scrutiny.First, we must say that we are strong supporters of the underlying concept of providing, enhancing and maintaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive community. We live our lives accordingly, and hope that each of you do, as well.\nIf the council were to remove the DEI statement from the county handbook, are you saying that you, the council and by extension, Talbot County and its citizens, do not agree with providing a supportive and equitable workplace? Are you saying that not all county employees are valued, but that some are and some aren't? Which are not, and why?\nAre you saying that you reject a workplace that values respect, understanding and acceptance of all employees or just some? What could possibly have changed to make Talbot County less accepting, understanding and committed to fostering a safe and equitable workplace for all of our valuable county employees? This can only be the result of the current political climate that has demonized the concept of DEI far beyond what it actually is and the wonderful spirit with which the prior Talbot Council unanimously approved this statement.\nPlease do not let politics pollute and degrade the admirable traits contained in the statement, and let's continue to honor and respect all of our fellow citizens equally. We urge you to keep Talbot County great by keeping the diversity, equity and inclusion statement not only in the employee handbook, but in our hearts, minds and actions as a community.\nWhich of these things, specifically, are you no longer committed to, and why?\nThe county is committed to: (1) maintaining an inclusive, productive, supportive, open, innovative and equitable workplace environment in which every individual is valued for his or her unique characteristics; (2) fostering respect, understanding and acceptance of differences; and (3) enabling employees to reach their full potential, thus enhancing the relationships among ourselves and optimizing the quality of services to our residents and our fellow employees.\nPEG AND RICK HUGHES\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Fountain case sparked animosity between papers\n\n February 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JOSEPH KOPER | Section: Columns \n \n 1200\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n During the two-plus years of the contentious Isaiah Fountain case (1919-1921), Easton and Talbot County were rocked with many controversies and side stories that derived from the the original case. In April 1919, Isaiah Fountain — an African American — was accused of raping a local white girl. Fountain's case generated hundreds of news articles relating to his case resulting from: his two trials and convictions, multiple lynching attempts, two escapes and manhunts, armed infantry troops surrounding the Talbot County courthouse, questionable court decisions and his controversial execution.The general sentiment in conservative Talbot County was that Fountain was guilty of raping the white girl. Of course, during the Jim Crow era, any allegations of sexual or even suspicious social contact between a Black man and a white female were taken extremely seriously by the white population. During this period there were many locals who felt the need to to resort to the \"Lynch Law.\" Similar sentiments were echoed — or even promoted — by the Easton Star-Democrat. Contrary viewpoints were quickly and passionately disputed by the paper. As with most local editors of the era, though, the Star-Democrat's Samuel E. Shannahan was determined to present Easton and Talbot County in the best light possible.\nAccording to Norman Harrington's book, \"Easton Album,\" Shannahan was the longtime editor of the Easton Star-Democrat. Harrington described Shannahan as: \"chauvinistic, elevating the interests of Talbot County above all else.\" Shannahan was the ultimate local \"booster\" for Talbot County and didn't stand for any criticism about his home county.\nCertainly, he didn't accept the implications of Lynch Law, Jim Crow, mob violence and racism that the events of Fountain case cast over Easton and Talbot County. He was determined to uphold the honor and reputation of his hometown, regardless of what \"outside\" publications printed.\nThe Baltimore newspapers (Sun, Evening Sun, News and Afro-American) viewed the Fountain case with a somewhat more balanced journalistic eye. They generally reported evidence that suggested that Isaiah Fountain was innocent of the rape charges.\nThe reporting of the \"big city\" newspapers infuriated editor Harrington, who took issue with just about everything the the Baltimore papers printed. When the Baltimore papers reported that a 2,000-person mob attempted to lynch Isaiah Fountain, the Easton weekly minimized the lynching attempt and blamed the \"excitement,\" on people from other counties or troublemakers from Delaware.\nShannahan was furious that the Baltimore press would dare impugn the dignity of local citizens by reporting opposing accounts of events. A Star-Democrat editorial labeled the \"big city\" newsmen as \"a mob of cub reporters\" and called their reporting \"not only unfair but disgusting.\" In another article the Star-Democrat used bold type to complain: \"Of all the things to be resented, next to the crime itself, the absolute contempt for the truth, the utter barefaced lies published by the press of Baltimore city, is most to be condemned.\"\nIn short, there was very little that the Baltimore and Easton papers agreed upon regarding the Fountain case. This visceral journalistic animosity even extended beyond the matters of the Fountain case. For example — in an attempt to mend journalistic fences — the Baltimore News sent a reporter to Easton to write a sort of travelogue about the town. The News published the article on Sunday, Feb. 1, 1920, and the Star-Democrat reprinted the story a week later.\nSurprisingly, the local press expressed dissatisfaction with the article and ignored its very positive depictions of Easton. A person reading the story today, would think that it was crafted by a public relations firm hired by the Easton Chamber of Commerce. Still the article's praise for Easton didn't matter to the local weekly. The paper continued its journalistic feud with the Baltimore News by it's headline for the story it reprinted on Feb. 7, 1920: \"Says Easton is slow/Baltimore news man does not flatter Talbot's county seat in review in Sunday's issue/Says we pride ourselves on quality instead of quantity — sees us as serene and satisfied'\nThe Star-Democrat prefaced the News article with this statement: \"Some of the story is good, some untrue, and none of it as good as Easton is entitled to.\" Today, a reader of the article would probably agree that Easton was as desirable a place to visit and live then as it is now.\nThe only comments that I could discern as being even remotely negative involved the \"high cost of living\" (i.e., the \"two-bit\" bus ride from the railroad station) and this statement: \"... Easton, Talbot's lovely county seat, grows with that slowness that is akin to sureness. ...\"\nThe article is chock full of complements, calling Easton: \"Serene and satisfied\" and \"lovely.\" The article praises \"the well-paved thoroughfares,\" \"charming homes\" and \"ancient and worthy trees.\" The Baltimore News reporter wrote with awe about visiting The Old Friends Meeting House and described his visit to the nearby Wye House and its \"wonderful old garden.\" He called the Wye House \"one of the most beautiful and historical estates on the Eastern Shore.\"\nReading the Baltimore News review about Easton over a century later, I confess that I don't understand the Star-Democrat's stubborn viewpoint about the article being \"untrue\" or unkind to Easton. The apparently offending comment about Easton's \"slowness that is akin to sureness\", strikes me as a very positive comment.\nThe complaint about the \"high cost of living\" and the \"two bits\" it cost for transportation from the train station are hardly condemnations, but merely observations that many of us might make today about the economy. The Baltimore News reporter gushed with praise for Easton, describing it as: \"this attractive town\" \"Easton gives constant pleasure to the artistic eye\" and \"well-groomed, well-bred, and unobtrusive.\"\nThe writer also portrayed the town as \"lovely\", and \"the most pleasing of the larger cities of the Eastern Shore.\" The News reporter then described Easton as: \"the Queen City of the glorious Eastern Shore of Maryland\" and \"richly endowed by nature as a manufacturing center and place of residence.\" The reporter praised the \"well-paved\" streets, \"splendid sidewalks\" and the sewerage system \"of the most advanced type.\" The article even cited the town's \"efficient lighting plant,\" and its plan to purchase a modern motor fire engine.\"\nAfter reading the Star-Democrat's hyper-critical and fussy comments about the Baltimore News article, one must ask: \"What's wrong about this gushing review of Easton?\" The News article about Easton sure makes it seem like the kind of place one would like to visit or live. I think most readers would agree that the lovely town of Easton is still much the same as described in the newspaper article from over a century ago — except for the century-old vitriol shown for the \"big city papers\" and the comment about having to spend \"two bits to ride in the omnibus.\"\nWith his stanch anti-Fountain editorial viewpoint and disdain for \"big city\" newspapers, Editor Samuel Shannahan remained fiercely devoted to his hometown and the Easton Star-Democrat. Under his editorship, in 1937 the Maryland Press Association named the Easton Star-Democrat as the best weekly newspaper in Maryland. Ever the newsman, Shannahan died on December 7, 1942, while working at his editor's desk — some 22 years after he declared the Isaiah Fountain case to be \"... one of the most noted in the State's annals.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "An age in America comes to an end\n\n May 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Columns \n \n 890\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The small town of Oroville, California, drifted into the 20th century as a shadow of its former self.Back in 1848, when gold was discovered in the area, prospectors had poured into the place. But by 1900 the vein had long since petered out, and the town had become little more than an agricultural backwater.\nMeanwhile, the modern world marched on. In Los Angeles, California's first movie theater opened for business in 1902. The next year, the Wright brothers made the first heavier-than air flight at Kitty Hawk. And in 1908, Henry Ford brought the automobile within reach of everyday Americans when he introduced the reliable, relatively inexpensive Model T.\nStill, news of these wonders would have arrived in Oroville as little more than rumors of a wider, more sophisticated world.\nThen, on Aug. 29, 1911, a teenaged layabout named Floyd Hefner strode into the corral of the local slaughterhouse, intending to hitch up a team of horses, and found a nearly naked man leaning unsteadily against a fence-post. The last living member of a Native American tribe had come in from the cold.\nPerhaps not surprisingly for the time and place, guns were drawn, dogs were held at bay, and someone used the telephone in the slaughterhouse to call the law. By the time the sheriff arrived, a butcher's cloak had been thrown over the shoulders of the man, who spoke no language anyone understood. The sheriff handcuffed the man, drove him into town in a wagon (the first time in his life he'd ever ridden in a wheeled vehicle), and locked him up in the county jail.\nIt wasn't long before newspapers throughout the state were reporting the discovery of America's \"last wild Indian.\" Learning of the news, Alfred Kroeber, a renowned professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, sent a colleague, Thomas Waterman, up to Oroville.\nMeeting with the prisoner in his cell, Waterman thought he might be speaking a language related to the Yana tongue. Waterman knew a little Yana, and when he tried it out on the prisoner, the man's face lit up.\nFor the first time since the only other members of his Yahi band had died, he had heard another human being speak a word or two he understood.\nWaterman was able to ask the man his name. Using a combination of gestures and simple Yahi, the man explained that in his culture it was taboo to speak his name aloud to someone else until another member of his tribe had formally introduced him. As this was now impossible, Waterman ended up simply calling him \"Man\" in the Yahi tongue.\nAnd so it is that this Native American man comes down to us in history under the false name of \"Ishi.\" We will never know what his real name was.\nWaterman's fellow professor at Berkeley, Alfred Kroeber, was a remarkable man. He had earned his doctorate in 1901 from Columbia University, studying under Franz Boaz, the father of modern anthropology. Kroeber took Ishi in and gave him a place to live in the university's museum, where Ishi worked as a janitor. This allowed Kroeber and the other anthropologists in his department to study Ishi closely over the remaining five years of his life.\nYou might expect that much of what Kroeber and Waterman learned from Ishi would have been horrifying. This was a man who, from boyhood, watched his tribe and immediate family whittled down by ceaseless slaughter. Norman Kingsley, an eager participant in one of the last massacres, later recounted that, in the middle of his attack, he exchanged his .56 caliber Spencer rifle for a .38 caliber pistol, because the rifle \"tore them up so bad,\" especially the babies.\nBut after his introduction into modernizing California, accounts say Ishi didn't speak of the horrors he'd witnessed, nor did he give in to melancholy or despair. He adapted with grace to his new life and embraced many of the changes happening in the world around him.\nI learned of Ishi from Alfred Kroeber's wife and fellow anthropologist Theodora Kracaw Kroeber, who, in 1961, wrote \"Ishi in Two Worlds,\" now considered a classic of modern anthropology. I first read the book 40 years ago, and rereading it recently, I found myself placing Theodora Kroeber in the same league as Claude Lévi-Strauss. Without ever leaving any of her anthropological principles behind, she consistently writes clear, compelling prose.\nIt isn't easy reading the first part of Kroeber's book, watching as Ishi and the remaining members of his band are forced to withdraw further and further from the whites encroaching upon their world; until, finally, they retreat into that world's last untouched cañon, and, ultimately, its last bushy slopes.\nBut Kroeber's description of the way Ishi handles the world he is then brought into, the way he maintains his Yahi dignity in the face of that world's awesome power (while never losing his ability to see through its sometimes absurd idiosyncrasies) is somehow reassuring. It gave me hope for humanity at large.\nI reread \"Ishi in Two Worlds\" thanks to an Inter-Library Loan, but a copy of the book has now been placed in our collection at the Talbot County Free Library. You'll find it in the Easton library on the Biography shelves under the call letters ISHI. If you're in St. Michaels, you can place a reserve on the book and it will be sent down there for you. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Local veterans and residents gathered April 28 to dedicate the monument to these long-overlooked heroes.The soldiers served in the United States Colored Troops, which consisted of free and enslaved African Americans who fought for the Union during the Civil War. Queen Anne's County has identified about 435 men from across the county who served in these units, according to local historian Chris Pupke.\nMaryland contributed more than 8,000 men to the United States Colored Troops, and by the end of the war, Black soldiers represented about 10% of the Union force, he said.\nQueen Anne's County soldiers predominantly served in the 19th, 39th and 7th regiments, and participated in battles and sieges instrumental to turning the tide of the war and shaping the history of the divided nation, he said.\n\"These men, these heroes, fought, bled and died for this country and we are grateful,\" Pupke said.\nFollowing the war, these men started schools, built churches, searched for loved ones sold into slavery, and helped create the community known today, he said.\n\"Too often today their stories remain missing from our history books, from our community conversations, and from family histories,\" Pupke said.\nWhile more work is necessary to continually recognize the tremendous sacrifices made for freedom, \"today we celebrate these heroes, their bravery and sacrifices, accomplishments and contributions to our community,\" he said.\nAn initiative more than a year in the making, members of the Centreville Veterans Information Committee as well as local artists, masons, community members and county commissioners helped bring the project to fruition.\nKennard African American Cultural Heritage Center Executive Director Tara Coursey noted it was incredible to recognize the legacies of county Civil War soldiers.\nKennard stands as the repository of African American history in the county, so it is only fitting the plaque found a home there, she said.\nPerforming a dedication prayer, Deacon Frank Hessen of St. Christopher's said, \"With courage born of hope they marched from this very soil answering the call to defend the dignity of all people and forge a nation united in liberty. Their sacrifice, steadfastness, and unwavering resolve inspire us still, reminding us of the cost of freedom and the power of unity in the face of adversity.\"\nCommittee member Robert Simms teared up at the performance of taps dedicating the plaque. As a Vietnam-era veteran, Simms understood the loss of friends to war as well as a lack of recognition upon returning home.\nNoting the plaque's meaningfulness to him and others, \"It's been a pleasure to be part of this group,\" Simms said.\nThe Centreville Veterans Information Committee looks forward to the eventual installation of a 6-foot statue to further honor Queen Anne's County United States Colored Troops.\nThe committee's Veterans Coffee House welcomes veterans supporting veterans community and conversations every Monday at the American Legion Jeff Davis Post 18 at 11 a.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And thus the incredible bravery of these people,\" said Nelson. \"And again, in Harriet's case, the bravery to go back into that over and over again. And then go to South Carolina and help with the war.\"\nTwo years into the war, under the command of Union Colonel James Montgomery, Tubman became the first female to lead an armed military operation, one that many have called her most extraordinary accomplishment. During the Combahee River Raid, Tubman, Montgomery and 150 Black Union soldiers rescued more than 750 slaves.\nThe success of the raid is owed to Tubman's intelligence gathering. Tubman learned from those she helped free where the Confederacy hid torpedoes along the river and the proper routes to rescue people.\nAlongside freeing over 750 enslaved individuals, Union troops came on shore as slaves boarded the military vessels to destroy influential estates along the river. By the time Confederate forces learned what was happening, most of the damage was done.\nHonoring Tubman\nTo honor Tubman and those she fought alongside this Memorial Day, founder of the Menare Foundation Tony Cohen suggests learning more about her story.\n\"There is a new book called 'Combee,' which is one of the Pulitzer Prize Winners, and it's about her service to the Union Army in South Carolina,\" Cohen said.\nCohen is intimately familiar with Tubman's story, having followed in her footsteps in 1996.\n\"I walked from Montgomery County, Maryland to Canada along the route of the Underground Railroad. And so I walked 10 to 25 miles a day for about seven weeks. I stopped in all the towns along the way asking people what they knew about the Underground Railroad, sought out documentation and historical societies, and museums. I spoke with descendants of those folks who made the journey and those who helped them along the way. And I even stayed in people's houses every night, some of them being stops on the Underground Railroad,\" Cohen said.\nCohen is planning on commemorating the 30-year anniversary of his journey by doing it again. He wants to bring the story of the Underground Railroad to a new generation while bring attention to our National Parks on the nations 125th anniversary.\n\"She experienced some of the most harrowing aspects of the slavery system, but her legacy is about pushing through and transcending those situations to bring about change. And I think that's the legacy that folks on the Eastern Shore can be very proud of,\" said Cohen. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Five years after George Floyd’s death, race in America faces Trump-driven changes and crossroads\n\n May 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: National \n \n 1397\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in May 2020, Irving Joyner and Rob Carpenter saw some signs of change when it came to race relations in America.Police agencies were pressed for more transparency and greater ability to charge officers accused of wrongdoing. Major employers, federal agencies, universities and progressive communities launched diversity and inclusion initiatives.\nFive years after Floyd's death and ensuing protests and unrest, Joyner, a law professor at North Carolina Central University, is less optimistic.\n\"Now the opposite is occurring,\" Joyner said. \"There is a retrenchment.\"\nHe points to efforts by the Trump administration and other conservatives to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs and affirmative action hiring requirements, the directions of policies related to immigration and refugees and rollbacks of legal oversight sought by the Biden administration with the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments after the killings of Floyd and Breonna Taylor in 2020.\n\"The playbook seems to be pretty clear. There is an effort to undermine all the racial progress,\" Joyner said, contending DEI programs criticized by conservatives aim to be pathways to seeing the benefits of a pluralistic society.\n\"We see the parallels and the perils,\" Joyner said of the current landscape and America's history with race.\n'PROTECTING COMMUNiTIES' Since returning to power in January, President Donald Trump has shut down DEI programs (including in the U.S. military) and affirmative action hiring requirements for federal agencies and contractors.\nTrump argues for a \"merit-based society\" and conservatives say DEI and affirmative action policies disadvantage white people and continue to classify people along racial lines.\nThe U.S. Justice Department on May 21 said that it is dismissing federal lawsuits and proposed consent decrees with police in Minneapolis and Louisville in response to the Floyd and Taylor incidents.\n\"Overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.\nDhillon said the moves aim to end the Biden administration's \"failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments.\"\nA White House spokesperson said Trump is focused on safety and prosperity \"for all Americans\" and empowering law enforcement.\n\"President Trump is tirelessly enacting policies to ensure America's safety, prosperity, and success for all Americans. Through his Make America Safe Again agenda, the Trump Administration is committed to stopping crime, upholding justice, protecting communities, and empowering federal, state, and local law enforcement,\" said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields.\nThe White House said the president is not considering a pardon of Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer convicted of killing Floyd in May 2020.\nTrump has pressed the District of Columbia to remove Black Lives Matter street murals near the White House and wants to restore names of military bases that bore the names of Confederate generals.\nJoyner and Carpenter, an author and communications professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, feel undercurrents to Trump's rhetoric and agendas.\nThey see cultural and racial undertones to Trump's hard lines on immigration (including his efforts to end birthright citizenship), his nostalgia for a \"Golden Age\" of America and his administration's cuts to foreign aid and refugee programs for developing countries while launching a new one for white Afrikaner farmers from South Africa.\n\"Trump is perceived as turning back the clock,\" Carpenter said.\n'HUMAN NATURE'S SCRIPT'Carpenter sees societal swings after Floyd's death went viral on social media, highlighting police misconduct and America's complicated history of racial and social inequities.\n\"I do think there has been some progress,\" Carpenter said, noting some of the efforts related to policing.\nBut Carpenter said plenty of challenges remain citing research showing 75% of white people do not have friends of color and 66% of Black people don't have any white friends.\nCarpenter said African Americans still face obstacles and discrimination with jobs, noting a 2024 study that found job applicants with 'white-sounding' names were 50% more likely to get callbacks from employers than 'Black-sounding' names.\n\"It's an ongoing trauma. It's still a daily experience,\" Carpenter said of America's racial challenges.\nBut he also said the experiences of race in America and the current pushback to diversity and affirmative action programs have global and historical parallels.\n\"It's all throughout history where a majority population tends to favor themselves and dismiss the complaints of minorities,\" Carpenter said.\nHe said when minority rights are focused on, majority populations tend to feel they are being aggrieved.\n\"It's nothing new under the sun,\" Carpenter said. \"They are just following the human nature script.\"\nECHO CHAMBERSOthers on the frontlines of the social landscape see a mixed bag with the current state of race in America.\nErica Williams, executive director of A Red Circle, a St. Louis-based racial equity group, welcomed post-Floyd police changes such as body cameras and civilian review boards, but said the community distrust of law enforcement persists.\nShe said the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic \"deepened every pre-existing divide — especially in food access, education and health care.\"\nHer group has launched community food programs to help with post-pandemic inflation with U.S. prices up 25% since the pandemic.\n\"We grew more produce, hired youth interns, launched workshops and distributed thousands of pounds of fresh food to families,\" she said.\nAdanté Pointer, a California-based civil rights attorney, sees ups and downs with policing since 2020.\n\"We are seeing officers prosecuted more frequently than before,\" he said. \"However, police shootings and killings have gone up.\"\nLast year, police killings of civilians totaled 1,365 persons, the highest on record, according to Mapping Police Violence.\nThere were 1,159 police-involved deaths in 2020.\nWhite people made up 42.7% of the 2024 deaths while accounting for 59% of the total population. Black people accounted for one-quarter of fatal police incidents while making up 13% of the population.\nPointer said the dominance of social media in contemporary discourse offers an opportunity to learn more about others and their paths. But it also mirrors societal biases and beliefs and technology algorithms allow users to stay in their ideological and social lanes.\n\"It becomes an echo chamber,\" he said.\nGOODBYE DEI?Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York, sees racial pendulums throughout American history.\nHe said there has been progress in narrowing racial income, education and employment gaps but worries about Trump \"appealing to white grievance.\"\nNeiman said. \"It also assumes that Black people have used racism as a weapon to win special privileges at the expense of whites .. It is dangerous: It diverts attention from the real racial disparities in our society and from developing policies to address them.\"\nThe U.S. poverty rate stands at 11% with 18% of African-Americans, 17% of Hispanic Americans, 19% of immigrants and 8% of white Americans living in poverty, according to U.S. Census data and FederalSafetyNet.com.\nSome of the companies and organizations that embraced DEI efforts after Floyd's death have jettisoned those efforts amid pushback from Trump and conservatives.\nOthers have faulted DEI programs as patronizing and self-serving.\n\"DEI is embraced by the business community when they think it will enhance their bottom lines,\" Pointer said. \"They are more than willing to walk away when it's not popular.\"\nSeveral large U.S. businesses, brands and technology firms have sought warm relations with Trump since he returned to power, attending and bankrolling his inauguration and attending other White House events.\nMuneer Panjwani, CEO of Engage for Good (which connects businesses and nonprofits) said DEI programs have driven \"meaningful progress.\"\n\"Companies have become significantly more aware of systemic racism and structural barriers faced by marginalized communities, taking actionable steps toward equity,\" he said.\nBut Panjwani acknowledges Trump has leveraged feelings of alienation among some white people. He also said equity conversations have sometimes been framed too narrowly, overlooking class, gender and other factors.\nCarpenter said white working-class Americans, who have seen stagnant wages and high inflation, have felt unheard in contemporary discourses.\nAll that comes amid post-pandemic financial strains and concentrations of wealth.\n\"Economic inequality has reached alarming levels, with the richest 1% holding over 31% of the nation's wealth while nearly half of Americans still struggle with unexpected financial burdens,\" Panjwani said.\nWilliams said her Missouri-based stays focused on its local work, including a community farm that grows its own food and is looking to offer its own grocery store and food production kitchen.\n\"We've seen an escalation of rhetoric and policymaking that undermines inclusive education, equity initiatives and even basic access programs. In that environment, I stay focused on building what my community needs,\" she said\nCarpenter agrees that it takes popular and grassroots changes in mindsets to move the needle.\n\"Politicians never lead,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Moore unveils investment into marginalized communities during event on Pine Street\n\n June 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: News \n \n 653\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Gov. Wes Moore made a historic announcement at the historic Civil Rights meeting ground of Bethel AME Church in Cambridge on Juneteenth.Moore announced the allocation of $400 million to address discriminatory practices like redlining, mass incarceration and urban renewal in over 400 \"Just Communities.\"\nMaking the announcement at the Pine Street church on the holiday designated to commemorate the ending of slavery in the United States was no coincidence.\n\"This was the Black Wall Street operating in America,\" said the Rev. Devan Martin Thursday of Pine Street as he acknowledged the historic significance of the day, place and announcement. Martin energized the people sitting in pews, reminding them of those who have come here before.\n\"It's not an accident that we've come here on Juneteenth to not only stand on our own two feet, but to stand on the shoulders of our ancestors,\" he said. \"The Harriet Tubmans and Fredrick Douglasses who walked literally enslaved people through these grounds.\"\nCambridge's past\nDuring a time of civil unrest in Cambridge in the 1960s, Bethel AME served as a headquarters for the Civil Rights Movement, according to Dorchester County's tourism department. Many rallies and meetings were held at the church.\nIn the early 1960s, unemployment skyrocketed, exposing the Cambridge's severe racial divide. Although segregation was ruled unconstitutional in 1954, Cambridge maintained separate schools and recreational areas in the Second Ward for 10 more years.\nProtests endured for weeks in the summer of 1963 after promises of desegregation were backpedaled. Gov. J. Millard Tawes imposed martial law and deployed the Maryland National Guard to Cambridge, where it remained for 25 days. Martial law would remain in effect for a year.\nIn July of '67, H. Rap Brown, an emerging Black militant and chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, gave a speech in the town. On the corner of Pine and Ceder streets, Brown said, \"If this town don't come around, this town should be burned down.\"\nOn July 24, 1967, Pine Street went up in flames. The origin of fire remains unclear, though there has been a lot of speculation and finger pointing over the decades. Cambridge's Second Ward is still recovering from the fire, the segregation and the discrimination that followed.\nMoore's announcement\nA key theme among speakers at the Juneteenth event was that now is the time to rectify systemic and economic injustices affecting the community.\nMartin said this will not be a pull-yourselves-up-by-your-bootstraps approach. Instead, a path forward will be provided offering hope beyond self resilience, he said.\nAt Bethel AME., Moore announced over 400 \"Just Communities\" in Maryland, including Cambridge. The communities, 419 of Maryland's 1,463 census tracts, were determined by the state's Department of Housing and Community Development to be historically underserved.\nAccording to Moore, $400 million has been designated to address exclusionary policie in these communities. The \"Just Community\" designations will go into effect July 1.\n\"Today, Gov. Moore and Sec. (Jake) Day embodied how Maryland is setting a national standard for disrupting systemic inequities and ushering inclusive paths towards healing in and with communities from all zip codes,\" said Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture Vice Chair Jaelon Moaney, who is from Cambridge, in a press release Thursday.\nDuring his visit to Cambridge, Moore also announced an executive clemency order adding nearly 7,000 cases to his historic June 2024 mass pardon of 175,000 cannabis-related convictions. The 6,938 additional pardons, which are for simple cannabis possession convictions, are \"the result of continued partnership with the Maryland Judiciary to review cases since the first order was signed last June,\" Moore's office said in a press release.\n\"I also want to be very clear, we are not going to celebrate the benefits of (cannabis) legalization if we do not deal with the consequences of criminalization,\" Moore said to those gathered at Bethel AME. Thursday.\nMoore said both initiatives announced Thursday aim to address the long-term impacts of discrimination like that experienced by Cambridge's Pine Street community.\n\"Liberation is good, but we demand freedom,\" Moore said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge becomes a Just Community\n\n July 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 634\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — On Juneteenth at Bethel AME Church on Pine Street, Gov. Wes Moore announced the Just Communities designation of 419 locations across Maryland, including parts of Cambridge. Moore said it was not a coincidence this announcement was made in a city where the Civil Rights Movement took center stage.The Moore-Miller administration established the Just Communities Designation in 2024 to address policies that have disenfranchised generations of families, such as redlining and exclusionary zoning.\n\"We wanted to hold it in one of the communities that rose to the top tier of places that had experienced the most harm and from which, the least improvement has occurred,\" said Secretary of Housing and Community Development Jake Day of the Juneteenth event.\nThe initiative is the result of work by The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development Division of Just Communities. Day said he has worked closely with Division of Just Communities Assistant Secretary Cat Goughnour.\nDay said the Just Communities Act not only acknowledges past harms but returns resources to those communities. As part of the initiative, Day said Cambridge residents will see community-nominated projects for revitalization, such as facilities, housing and economic developments.\n\"We want to make sure that we understand what the community wants and not show up with development when people aren't asking for it,\" he said.\nAccording to Day, early indicators of success for the Just Communities Act would be more project activity in neighborhoods with visible scars, like the Pine Street corridor of Cambridge, formerly known as Black Wall Street.\nThis could include more home repairs for legacy homeowners, increased homeownership, new homes on vacant lots, new community buildings and more businesses. Long term outcomes include improved public health and reduced criminal justice involvement, Day said.\nCambridge Mayor Lajan Cephas said she feels this is a framework for justice. With Cambridge's history of slavery, Jim Crow, discriminatory policies and segregation among wards, Cephas is hopeful the Just Communities designation will begin to rectify past harms.\n\"It's being unwound,\" Cephas said. \"It's just great to finally address, you know, the financial instabilities and other opportunities that were held back in communities just like Cambridge.\"\nCephas said along with the investments made in the community, the Just Communities initiative pushes grant requests to the front of the line.\n\"I say, Gov. Moore, it's like you gave us platform shoes,\" she said. \"It's very difficult competing against these other municipalities. They have better grant writers, better budgets. You know, they have comprehensive plans that they've been working on for years, and we're just now getting caught up.\"\nCephas wants to make it clear that these initiatives will not solely benefit Black residents, but will benefit all residents who have been affected by discriminatory policies and live within the Just Communities designated area, which encompasses much of downtown Cambridge and surrounding neighborhoods.\nThe Just Communities Act has faced pushback from Maryland Republican lawmakers, who called the initiative an unproductive government handout and unfair to Maryland taxpayers, according to a statement issued to the Baltimore Sun.\nIn a statement to the Star Democrat Friday morning, Maryland Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) said, \"Does anyone really believe pumping hundreds of millions into handpicked areas will build generational wealth?\"\n\"This is wealth redistribution dressed up in equity language — it's socialism, plain and simple,\" the statement said.\nBut the initiative's proponents contend the Just Communities designations aim to ensure fairness among Maryland residents.\n\"It's the very picture of fairness as I was raised and taught to understand fairness,\" Day said. \"Again, take something from somebody and you return it.\"\nCephas echoed Day's sentiments, pointing to the \"unfair\" practices that have held Cambridge back.\nThe community can check on updates for the Just Communities Designation at choosecambridge.com, where residents can sign up for public alerts via text or email.\nThis report has been updated to include comments from Sen. Stephen Hershey. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

On Saturday, the Easton-based Frederick Douglass Honor Society is hosting an annual community reading. Local officials, community leaders, residents and children are reading aloud portions of the address on the lawn of the Talbot County Courthouse starting at 10 a.m.\nVickie Wilson, the society's treasurer, says this year's calendar couldn't have worked out any better, with the event falling on the same day Douglass spoke to the Rochester Ladies Anti-Slavery Society.\n\"What's really exciting for us this year is that the first time Douglass read this speech was on July 5, 1852,\" Wilson said. \"And now, it falls again on July 5.\"\nThe Frederick Douglass Honor Society has held the reading annually since 2018, though it was put on pause last year for a separate event. Wilson says this year's return is exciting due to the diversity of people — in age, race, occupation and more — participating in the reading. Fifty-nine people are expected to step up to the podium.\n\"We live in a diverse community,\" Wilson said. \"It's going to show the love that we have for this community as well.\"\nDouglass in his 1852 speech explained the significantly different perspective enslaved people had on the Fourth of July holiday.\n\"What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim,\" Douglass said.\nHe continued: \"To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy — a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.\"\nWilson says the Talbot County tradition during the week of Independence Day is a moving one. She encourages people, no matter how they celebrate the holiday the rest of the week, to attend on Saturday.\nShe said the speech is a \"lot to unpack,\" but extremely powerful. It still resonates with her today, and she believes it does for many Talbot County residents.\n\"It still matters today,\" Wilson said. \"And I often think it matters more today in the climate that we're in right now. Everything here about this speech is still relevant.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Today, Cephas family members hold key political positions in a number of Dorchester County towns and beyond.\nFor Brandy James, being part of the Cephas family means pride, resilience and honoring generations of strength, leadership and cultural identity in the Black community.\n\"The struggles of our ancestors were not in vain and have come to fruition,\" she said.\nJames, a Federalsburg council member, is the daughter of Hurlock Mayor Charles Cephas. James's cousins are Cambridge Mayor Lajan Cephas and Cambridge City Council President Sputty Cephas.\nIf one was not told before a city council meeting that Lajan used to change Sputty's diapers, you'd likely never know that they're siblings, but they're a dynamic duo in Cambridge's local government.\n\"I see it as my mission and my purpose to serve,\" Lajan said, but she didn't just mean as mayor. For the Cephases, politics can be a conduit to care for and serve the community, but it is not the main player.\n\"It doesn't have to be political to show that you care or that it's okay to help your neighbor. It's about the human aspect of it all. It's about being a good neighbor and considering your community as an extension of your family. That's how I see it,\" James said.\nThe Cephas Family History\nAround 1817, Moses Cephas and his family were slaves at a property near the Fork Neck area — situated between Cambridge and Vienna — where Charles, the self-proclaimed acting patriarch, said the family had \"deep roots.\"\nThat is until after the Civil War, when Moses and Josiah Cephas inherited a large farm near Vienna, becoming the proprietors of the largest Black-owned farm in Dorchester County. The Cephases sold produce, including corn and tomatoes, on Race Street in Cambridge and leased out part of the farm to white individuals, Charles said.\nLajan said along with farmers, there are watermen and sailors in the Cephas lineage.\nCharles said that during slavery, some Cephas family members were captured by the renowned slave hunter Patty Cannon. Slave hunters like Cannon practiced in the illegal slave trade, also known as the Reverse Underground Railroad, where they found and captured escaped and freed slaves to return them back to slavery.\nDuring this time, family members' names were changed from Cephas with an A to Cephus with a U to facilitate their transport across state lines back to the South.\nPerhaps one of the most fascinating Cephas family members — which difficult to determine considering the incredible cast of characters — is Richard \"Big Dick\" Cephas.\nA fictional version of his life where he fights in the Haitian revolution and falls in love with a young American woman is presented in Kenneth Roberts' best-selling novel \"Lydia Bailey.\" But Charles said after speaking to several historians, he knows the real truth.\n\"He ran away from slavery and he went all the way to Boston, Massachusetts, and he ended up being in the British Army,\" he said. \"He fought against America, he was captured and put in prison there, and they were able to trace it because he was such a disruptor that he caused a riot in the prison.\"\nBeing a disrupter is sometimes a necessary agent of change.\nIn 1962, Charles made history as one of the first Black people to graduate from the newly desegregated Cambridge High School. After serving on the town council for two decades, acting as president for one of those, he became the first Black mayor of the town of Hurlock in 2021 and was re-elected last year.\nIn 2023, James became the first Black lawmaker in Federalsburg's 200-year history. The following year, Lajan became the second Black female mayor of Cambridge and Sputty was re-elected onto the City Council and elected by his fellow council members as council president.\nCephas family values\nFor the Cephases, faith is at the center of all they do.\n\"You know, that's the foundation that we come from, and not only that, we take the last name of Cephas to a deeper meaning, more or less than the meaning that you see in the Bible,\" Lajan said. \"I guess anyone who is a Christian or anyone that's read the Bible, Jesus had the moment where he referred to Peter as a Cephas, and that was essentially the foundation of how Christianity was established.\"\nCharles has 14 children and 49 grandchildren — maybe a few more, maybe a few less. It's easy to lose count he said. At 75 years old, Charles said he's excited to watch the legacy he has helped build continue to prosper and grow.\nFor Lajan and Brandy, it is also important that Cephas is not synonymous with politics.\nBoth have children who pursued careers outside of politics. For both, it is important that their children carry the long-withstanding Cephas values into whatever they do.\n\"They feel the pressure to do what they're supposed to do so we can make God happy. That's their pressure,\" said Lajan about her sons. \"You know, to govern themselves accordingly.\"\nLajan said she wants the people of Dorchester County to know that while the Cephases are deeply rooted, they are a small piece of the larger puzzle and beautiful fabric of all the other names in the county.\nSome of the other names may even be Cephases.\nMany formerly enslaved individuals either had their names changed or changed their names after obtaining freedom. Because of this, Charles said there are many Cephases out there that likely don't even know they are Cephases.\nCharles said the descendants they've been able to trace can be located all over the U.S., including Alaska. Recently, they were able to trace Cephases in Japan. In the next few months, there will be a massive Cephas family reunion with descendants from all over the country and beyond. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Daniel Espinal was a foregone conclusion. To put it simply, he was targeted.ICE has been creating self-serving catches across the nation which both polish its badge and dispirit Hispanic communities. Doubtless, members of Pastor Espinal's church should be sure that ICE will be worshipping with them this Sunday, prayers in Spanish offered inside, whilst outside agents will be checking license plates, awaiting their drivers. There will be no coffee hour.\nThis has happened before in Easton.\nIn 1994, the then-INS raided an apartment complex, hauling off at least a dozen undocumented Hispanics. I represented many of their cases before the Asylum Office in Arlington, Virginia, and in the U.S. Immigration Court in Baltimore. As in those days I pastored a store front chapel in downtown Easton, I made it privately known to our Hispanics to enter by the alley door for the following Sunday's Spanish mass. Mass concluded, our strategy was to have those with green cards or who were citizens to socialize outside the front door. The INS agents, whom we expected, were baffled, even angry, to be greeted by our legals – while other worshippers squeezed into the sacristy, invisible through the chapel's front windows – all of them documented within the immigration system, yet vulnerable to agents eager only to collect vast numbers.\nTo victimize prominent members of a targeted community has been well learned by ICE. When Herman Goering established the Third Reich's Gestapo in 1933, their methods were to first target such prominent Jews as rabbis and cantors, congregation and community leaders, elected civic leaders and teachers, thus dispiriting and creating fear within the remaining Jewish families. Those secret state police, taught to sniff out their fears, sent Jews off to the Alligator Alcatraz's of their time. It's an old, old story. It has happened in every civilization in recorded history.\nTHE RT. REV.

The parishioners currently aren't meeting out of fear the same will happen to them.\n\"You know, the members of the congregation believe, and rightfully so, that if this could happen to somebody with Pastor Fuentes Espinal's stature and position within the community, then nobody's safe,\" said Len Foxwell, a close family friend of Espinal's.\nThe Rt. Rev. Joel Marcus Johnson, a bishop from Easton, said canceling services now is wise.\n\"It's wise on their part, I think because we know that ICE would be showing up,\" Johnson said.\nJohnson knows this because he lived it in 1994 when U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services — the precursor to ICE — showed up to one of his Spanish services at a storefront chapel in Easton.\nJohnson, clergy and the congregation came up with a plan where the undocumented immigrants went out the back door and those with green cards or citizenship went out the front.\n\"It really, really angered INS,\" Johnson said.\nJohnson said arresting high-ranking members of the church is a targeted approach that is not new.\n\"It's one of the tried and true methods for dispiriting or deflating the hearts of these communities,\" he said.\nMatthew Peters, executive director of the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said he is not aware of any recent ICE arrests in churches on the Mid-Shore, but due to uncertain policy changes, fear is widespread.\nCOMMUNITY RALLIESEspinal was detained by two U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement agents and taken to the Salisbury Field Office. He was quickly transferred to the Baltimore ICE detention center, where he remained for three nights. On Thursday, Espinal was transferred to an ICE detention center in Louisiana, where he will stay until his hearing, which has not been scheduled yet.\nEspinal has been in the U.S. since 2001, has no criminal record and has been attempting to secure citizenship legally for years. He has been described as a pillar of the community. A GoFundMe created by Foxwell has raised over $44,000 to cover attorney's fees and other expenses.\nICE said in a statement to the Star Democrat that Espinal was arrested for overstaying his six-month visa.\n\"Daniel Omar Fuentes Espinal is an illegal alien from Honduras who was arrested by ICE on July 21, in Easton, Maryland,\" the statement said. \"Fuentes entered the United States on a 6-month visa and never left in 24 years. It is a federal crime to overstay the authorized period of time granted under a visitors visa.\"\nCommunity members, religious leaders and politicians have rallied behind Espinal, holding protests in both Easton and Baltimore since his arrest. On Friday, over 150 people showed up to support Espinal with a rally on U.S. Route 50 in Easton.\nAccording to Foxwell, around 300 people showed up to a rally in Baltimore on Monday. He said he was nervous that people wouldn't turn out because they don't know Espinal, but that was not the case.\n\"I didn't know if we would be playing to an empty McKeldin Square, but the place was full,\" Foxwell said.\nThe rally began with a march from the square to the Fallon Courthouse, the site of the temporary ICE detention center where Espinal was held before being transferred to Louisiana.\nAnother rally for Pastor Espinal will be held in Easton Friday, Aug. 1, from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. at the intersection of Dover Street and Route 50. The rally will be hosted by the Talbot County Democratic Forum and the Talbot County Democratic Central Committee. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He fled north in 1838 and changed his name to Frederick Douglass. His brilliance, eloquence and courage, quickly brought him to the forefront of the abolitionist movement.\nHe was known for his skills as an orator, with many of his speeches remembered to this day.\n\"I would say critically important,\" James Young, the event's publicist, said said about Douglass. \"He's one of, if not the most respected and important figures in the history of the region. I think it's important for anybody to know more about his life and his work but especially for people who come from where he came from.\"\nFrederick Douglass Day kicked off with a parade led by Grand Marshal Childlene Brooks, former president of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society. The parade featured local groups including Building African American Minds, Easton High School NJROTC Color Guard, Polaris Village Academy, and the Easton and Oxford Fire Departments and many more.\nThis year, a big focus for the Frederick Douglass Honor Society was getting the younger generation involved in celebrating Douglass.\nGabriella Thompson, the mistress of ceremony, described as a \"ambitious 14-year-old entering her freshman year of high school,\" and Javion Jones, a 15-year-old minister at Union Baptist Church, were some of the youth featured throughout the day.\n\"I would say there has been some effort to get new people involved. As you know, a lot of people on the committee itself are getting up there,\" Young said. \"So it's a thing that we want to keep going for the foreseeable future, and so at some point you've got to bring in some some fresh blood.\"\nMultiple local leaders attended and participated in Frederick Douglass Day.\nJaelon Moaney, vice chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture, recited a famous speech by Douglass. The honor society believes having connections like Moaney are important for the success of the society and the annual event.\n\"Having that connection to African-American history more broadly, as well as current African-American issues, I think is very important,\" Young said. \"That's also something that we try to focus on with the keynote speaker that we bring every year. It's somebody who can bring a perspective of speaking on Douglas but also how he kind of fits into the history of African-American intellectual philosophy.\"\nIn an email following the event, Moaney emphasized his own Eastern Shore roots, similar to those of Douglass.\n\"I, too, am from and decidedly of Talbot,\" Moaney said. \"The Bailey and Moaney families remain connected today. Although two agitators separated by time, my chest began to swell with inexplicable energy while echoing the words delivered on November 25, 1878 from exactly where he stood nearly two centuries prior. As the country commemorates the semiquincentennial and Talbot reaches its 365th anniversary next year, I'm both troubled and moved by the parallels of reality that this experience has revealed.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Columbus Day honors Italian American resilience\n\n October 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CHRIS CORCHIARINO | Section: Columns \n \n 717\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Every October, the debate over Columbus Day versus Indigenous Peoples' Day resurfaces, framed as a choice between two communities. Yet Italian Americans, like Indigenous people, have endured marginalization and discrimination. These are American stories of resilience that deserve recognition. Turning their struggles into a zero-sum culture war dishonors both cultures.As the son of an Italian immigrant, I support a day for recognizing Indigenous People. I wish those pushing this narrative used the other 364 days to address Indigenous poverty, land rights and generational neglect — not just symbolic gestures. Importantly, we don't need to erase the hard-won recognition that Italian Americans fought for through Columbus Day. How it came to exist is important.\nOn March 14, 1891, New Orleans Police Chief David Hennessy was murdered. As he lay dying, he whispered \"Dagoes\" — a slur for Italians. Anti-Italian hysteria ignited. The mayor ordered police to \"arrest every Italian you come across,\" and families hid as vigilantes roamed the streets.\nWhen nine Italian immigrants were acquitted and three had mistrials, a mob stormed the jail, dragging 11 out—some shot, some hanged, their bodies mutilated as crowds cheered. It remains one of the largest single mass lynchings in U.S. history.\nThe press celebrated it as righteous justice. Theodore Roosevelt called it a \"rather good thing,\" reflecting widespread contempt for Italians as racially inferior. To ease diplomatic tensions with Italy, President Benjamin Harrison declared a one-time Columbus Day in 1892 — an acknowledgment born from violence and tragedy.\nFor Italian Americans Columbus Day isn't primarily about Christopher Columbus. It is about survival, recognition, and pride in the face of discrimination. Italian immigrants had been celebrating it informally since 1866, using the explorer as a symbol of their right to belong in America.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Italian immigrants were among America's lowest-paid workers, toiling in coal mines and laying railroad tracks under brutal conditions. Many fell victim to the padrone system, where labor bosses trapped them in debt, locked them in camps and withheld wages.\nDuring World War II, thousands of Italians were designated \"enemy aliens,\" facing curfews, travel restrictions and property seizures. Some were interned.\nThe Ku Klux Klan actively fought against Columbus Day recognition. They campaigned to strip it as a state holiday in Oregon, burned a cross at a 1924 celebration in Pennsylvania and blocked a Columbus statue installation in Virginia in 1927.\nYet Italian Americans persisted. Through decades of advocacy, Columbus Day became a federal holiday in 1968. Parades celebrated not just an explorer, but Italian Americans who contributed to society — scientists, artists, laborers, soldiers, entrepreneurs. A tradition started by blue-collar immigrants who scraped together money to erect statues and organize celebrations.\nToday, the push to replace Columbus Day often overlooks this history. For Italian Americans, it has always been about their own resilience, not defending Columbus's atrocities. Yet those who object to the name never propose renaming the holiday to preserve Italian American recognition. Instead, they seek to eliminate it entirely — erasing the history of how Italian immigrants were treated and why this day mattered.\nEven in recent history, when Columbus statues are toppled — statues funded by immigrant communities scraping together pennies — crowds cheer, but those cheers are celebrating the erasure of working-class immigrant history.\nThis erasure is troubling because bigotry toward Italian Americans hasn't disappeared. Mafia stereotypes remain acceptable punchlines. Mocking Italian accents is still considered harmless comedy. I grew up seeing this bigotry visited upon my father — but like other Italians, he persevered.\nWe shouldn't force a choice between honoring Italian American struggles and recognizing Indigenous peoples. Both histories deserve celebration.\nIf \"Columbus\" is the obstacle, the productive conversation would be about renaming the October holiday while still honoring Italian American heritage. However, when that is not the topic and the discussion ignores this history, it's difficult to pass it as anything more than anti-Italian bigotry. We shouldn't dismiss the struggles of Italian immigrants who, like my father, built lives in America fueled by the promise of the American Dream. It's a uniquely American story that should be told. Their story — the persecution, resilience and contribution to the American fabric — deserves to be remembered. Pitting groups against each other in an annual culture war is wrong and not in keeping with the promise of America.\nChris Corchiarino is a Maryland attorney and Queen Anne's County resident. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
