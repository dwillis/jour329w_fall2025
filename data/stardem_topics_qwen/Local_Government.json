    "content": "WATERMAN WAY - Working together, group chooses name for new Cambridge street\n\n August 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 742\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - It's official: Waterman Way will be the name of the new road at Cambridge Harbor.The name choice was not a solo decision. Residents gathered at Cambridge Harbor Tuesday evening to vote on the name of the new road parallel to the water that intersects Aurora Street and Dorchester Avenue.The name-choosing event gave residents the chance to hear the three options and pick their favorite. As they voted on their favorite name, attendees enjoyed a free scoop of ice cream from the Scottish Highland Creamery and even got a chance to try their luck at a raffle for free Cambridge Harbor merchandise.Matt Leonard, executive director of Cambridge Waterfront Development said the new street that is closest to the park will be the perfect street to close off and use for events once it is paved.\"We can have food trucks, we can have art shows, we can have music festivals,\" Leonard said. \"So this will blend seamlessly into this activated park that we're going to have.\" On Tuesday evening, community members were given three options for the new name: Sailwinds Plaza, Waterman Way and Harbor Way. Everyone got the opportunity to vote on their favorite name using a QR code or by simply telling BCT Design Group Principal Bob Northfield their choice. BCT Design Group has been helping Cambridge Waterfront Development with the naming process.Votes were tallied during the event so that the winning name could be shared before the event ended.Betsey Harrington, who voted for the winning name, said Waterman Way is \"traditional\" for Dorchester County.Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer also said he voted for Waterman Way. Pfeffer said it \"pays heritage\" to the county, whose seal depicts a waterman and a farmer.While neither voted for the winning name, Chesapeake College Cambridge Center Director Lorelly Solano and Chesapeake College Director of Development Amber McGinnis were excited to vote on Tuesday.\"We are neighbors and active members of the community,\" Solano said. \"So we're excited to support our partners and see the community grow.\" The three names that community members voted on are all in the theme of maritime heritage.Cambridge Waterfront Development, with the help of BCT Design Group, put out an online survey in June for community members to rank different themes that the street name would be created from.The survey, which closed July 1, gave the community four themes to rank. The three other themes were Rose Hill, roses and light/sources of light.McGinnis said she is happy that the Cambridge Waterfront group has tried to listen to and involve the community in its decision-making process.\"There are so many times that partners have come in and haven't really considered the community,\" McGinnis said. \"And I do feel like Matt and that group has really tried to integrate community needs and wants, realizing they can't make everyone happy. And so the fact they're even just getting input on the naming of the street, I think it validates that they're happy to have the community engaged.\" Leonard said Cambridge Waterfront Development is a \"community-first organization.\" \"When it comes to things that we can get direct input from the community on, like a name, we think they should be a part of it,\" he said. \"And it just gives them the real buy-in. It gives us real input as to what matters to the community. So as we focus more and more on the actual development of the buildings and the uses, we have a better understanding of what matters to the community.\" His organization's mission is to develop the harbor in partnership with the community so that it is a benefit to the community. Leonard called the relationship with the community \"a continued conversation.\" \"If we continue to put out really good accurate information, timely information, and listen to what the community says,\" Leonard said, \"the people who are commenting will be more and more positive over time and more bought in to the whole thing.\" McGinnis said that she thinks a lot of people in Dorchester County have a connection to the Cambridge Harbor area.\"I think to see this property be revitalized with some new and interesting ideas - workforce development, economic development, tourism - bringing in the old and the new identities of the county is really exciting.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nMatt Leonard, executive director of Cambridge Waterfront Development speaks to a crowd of people before giving them the opportunity to vote on what to name the new street at Cambridge Harbor Aug. 8. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

While elections used to be held from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m., they now begin at 8 a.m. and end at 8 p.m.Commissioners approved this change in election hours at an Aug. 23 meeting in 2022. The election in June of this year to fill previous Commission President Jimmy Jaramillo's seat was the first election where the increased hours were in effect.The drafted resolution would also change the start of term for election judges.Currently terms begin the first Monday in April of the year they are appointed by the commission.\"So essentially, if you're appointed in September, you're term had already started,\" Ryan said.The drafted resolution would make it so that election judges begin their term the day they are appointed. These terms would run for two years.A public hearing on the drafted resolution will be held Sept. 12 at 6 p.m. at 101 Market Street in Oxford.At Tuesday's meeting, commissioners also set a date to discuss language changes for the charter amendment that residents approved in a July 18 special election.The amendment, which goes into effect Aug. 17, changes how mid-term commission vacancies are filled. Instead of being appointed by the remaining commissioners, vacancies will be filled via special election.A work session to discuss possible adjustments to the language of this amendment will be held at 5 p.m. before the regular town meeting on Aug. 22.During a special meeting in July, Ryan discussed aspects of the amendment that might need to be changed including the length of the term of the elected commissioner, when candidates need to file a certificate of nomination and the timing from a vacancy announcement to when the election would need to be held. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Easton has six once you enter the parkway heading east.Over the years, traffic has increased dramatically on Route 50 as well as the Easton Parkway.And with the possibility of a third Bay Bridge in the region and a new traffic software package designed to regulate traffic light time on the Eastern Shore in order to minimize delays going East and West on Route 50, I would say we are in for a long summer season.As we all know, heavy traffic delays at Goldsboro, Dover and Dutchman's Lane keep getting longer and longer. Let alone, cross intersection accidents that are becoming a common occurrence.I would suggest that the State Roads Commission as well as Talbot County Roads establish a work study program to develop a bypass in Talbot County. It could be on the east side of Easton that would begin at the Route 404 and Route 50 area, or possibly at the Rabbit Hill exit and return to Route 50 East either at Trappe or Cambridge.While this would be a major project, saving lives and giving Talbot County residents the ability to get where they need to go on a timely basis is utmost to residents.It's all about the residents of Talbot County, not the tourists heading to the Beach.ROBERT J.

He has worked tirelessly to preserve all that makes Easton special during his 20 years as mayor, and I have no doubt that passion will translate into the Town Council presidency.Robert is a lifelong resident of the Town of Easton and Talbot County, where he raised his three children with his wife, Betsy. I am lucky enough to be one of his four grandchildren with whom he shared this town throughout our childhoods. Robert took everything that made Easton special and only built upon it, both in the community and the economy.Growing up, I have fond memories of coming to the Waterfowl Festival and Fourth of July fair every year, which Robert was always proud to share. His commitment to the town dates back further than just his time as mayor though, as he has also been a part of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department for over 60 years, the First Baptist Church for over 70 years, and the BPO Elks for almost 60 years.I have no doubt that the pride Robert has in this town will make him the perfect choice for the Easton Town Council president. He is passionate about continuing Easton's long history he worked so hard to build upon of being the successful, beautiful town that it is. Vote for someone who has proven his love for this town and helped it grow and evolve for as long as I can remember - vote for Robert C.

    "content": "Town Council president candidates state case\n\n August 31, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 1207\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - The four candidates vying to be the Easton Town Council's next president shared their thoughts on growth, development and health care in the town with community members at a town hall forum Tuesday evening.The candidate town hall, held at the Avalon Theatre and hosted jointly by the Talbot Spy and the Avalon Foundation, was moderated by Craig Fuller.Questions to the candidates centered on the role of the town council president, development and the community's health care needs.To former Easton Mayor Bob Willey, his decades of service to Easton, including a six-year stint as council president and experience managing a large workforce and millions of dollars in town budgets, set him apart as a candidate.\"I think there's a lot of things Easton has going for it, and I'd like to be part of keeping those things moving and getting them a little better, and (adding) a few more bells and whistles,\" he said.Experience is a key part of the campaign for former Ward 1 Councilman Al Silverstein, who said he'd learned a lot from others in his eight years on the council.\"It's a 20-month service, that's all we have left on this term, but I think it's 20 months of being able to move Easton in the right direction,\" he said in his opening statement. \"I think we've gone a long way under Mayor Willey in the past, but it's time to move forward with new ideas and new challenges, so I look forward to the opportunity.\" For Frank Gunsallus, who ran a close race for the Ward 1 seat on the town council in May, his campaign for Town Council president is a way to capitalize on momentum and support from the previous election.\"I am here to focus on smart growth, attainable housing, better health care and fair representation for all citizens of Easton,\" he said.To Kevin Bateman, continuing to serve Easton residents in a new way and improving the town are key reasons for running.\"I'm a person that believes that everyone matters, no matter who you are, where you come from, what your religion is, what your ethnicity is - we all matter, we're human beings first,\" he said. \"And keeping that in mind, that is why I've taken on this adventure: to try to make sure that every person in this town matters.\" Much of the town hall discussion focused on growth and development, issues that the public has frequently chimed in on in recent months.A Talbot County native, Willey recalled growing up in Easton in the 1940s and 1950s, when the town's population was under 6,000. But while the town's landscape has changed since then, some things have remained the same.\"I think we tend to soft pedal affordable housing; we think if we go ahead and build 100 houses, we're going to solve the problem - we aren't,\" he said.\"That problem's been around for years, it's going to be around for years to come.\" Willey said the town needs to look at including representation from all of the county's municipalities on the Talbot County Housing Commission, saying that all need to tackle the issue together. Having information on the types of homes available is key, too.\"Easton is not the one to solve the affordable housing issue; we'll do our part, but we don't do it all, and the others have got to chime in,\" he said.Also addressing development, Gunsallus spoke about ways to bring more connections to residents living on the east side of U.S. Route 50, where there isn't a place to safely cross.\"Finding ways to make bike-ability and walkability attainable for people who live across (Route) 50, who want to get downtown and not have to drive their car and worry about parking or traffic, are ways we should be looking to incorporate them into the fabric of our town,\" he said.Speaking on future development within the town, Bateman said that finding a suitable location for affordable housing for residents is the difficult part.\"It's a tough challenge to find the location that fits, that has the right space and the right mix,\" he said. \"We want to grow, we want to see responsible, common sense growth, and that's going to take a lot of thought and a lot of planning.\" To Silverstein, getting broader community input on the town's future comprehensive plan and keeping the town's growth rate at 1% are keys in addressing development.\"I think we have to plan for some growth, but we have to be smart about it,\" he said.And as for addressing the critical need for workforce housing, Silverstein said the town needs to buy land and designate it as a planned workforce housing project.The town needs to look at the financial factors impacting future home buyers to develop a strategic plan moving forward, he said.The discussion then pivoted to health care and a shortage of medical professionals in the community.Gunsallus said the need for a new hospital in Easton is \"long overdue,\" but it's only part of the problem. A shortage of primary care physicians and specialists greatly impacts many community members, and long wait times exacerbate the issue.To address the shortage in care, Gunsallus said the town could look into being designated as a health professional shortage area, which would open up state loan repayment programs for physicians to alleviate burdens for doctors trying to repay school debts.Tax incentives, along with state and federal grants and subsidies, are other things the town can look at utilizing to attract new physicians.\"Those are all things that we should be considering and trying to address in the short term, because those are also problems that a new hospital is not going to solve; that will only bring a new building here,\" he said, later adding: \"There are many people here who should not have to wait that long, and we have more pressing concerns in the short term.\" Bringing the new hospital to Easton is a top priority for Silverstein in the next 20 months if elected president of the council. To him, community leaders and members need to be making noise about building the new regional medical center.\"I think we need to be engaged with them, just like the county is engaged with them, on an ongoing basis, on a weekly basis, to ask the question: 'What's going on?'\" he said. \"We should be up in Annapolis banging on the governor's door and banging on the University of Maryland's door in Baltimore saying, 'This is not acceptable.Our community and our region deserve better service.'\" If elected, a top priority for Bateman is completing long-outstanding projects that have been postponed, ranging from the hospital to drainage issues.\"There's other communities in our town that have been they haven't been neglected, they just haven't had the attention that they should have,\" he said.In addition to the hospital, another priority for Willey, if elected, is addressing the comprehensive plan update.\"If that was in place, and we had our zoning rules up to date, if we had our needs for housing up to date, if we had the annexation requests up to date, and what we're going to need for public facilities, we wouldn't have had the fights that we were having over Poplar Hill and Maryland Health Club.\" \n \n Caption: Al Silverstein\n \nFrank Gunsallus\n \nKevin Bateman\n \nRobert Willey \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I joined the family business and worked alongside my dad until he decided to retire in 2022.Now at the helm, with my brother and sister-in-law, we are running the family business not an easy thing to do now a days. We ran across a licensing issue that was nearly impossible to solve. We did everything we could think of to resolve without success.Frustrated, I remember that in high school I worked as an intern at the Chamber of Commerce where they were champions for small business. I was put in touch with Al Silverstein, who actually remembered me.The short version, Al was instrumental in helping us solve the problem, he understood the gravity of our situation, took full charge, he knew exactly how to solve the issue in record time.He saved the day.I had a front row seat to Al in action. His experience, his connections, and his dedication to following it through to resolution.As council president, I am confident he will do the same for the citizens of our community.He has our vote and as family, as part of the business community and as neighbors.

    "content": "Zoning commission splits on YMCA recommendation - Cambridge Y may stay where it is if recommendation adopted\n\n September 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: A4 | Section: News \n \n 561\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - The Cambridge Planning and Zoning Commission voted four to three in favor of recommending to the City Council a companion ordinance to a proposed YMCA overlay ordinance Tuesday, Sept.5.The proposed companion ordinance is a zoning text amendment that would add an additional category within the table of permitted uses in the overlay ordinance, which the commission voted to recommend to the City Council Aug. 1.\"This should ensure that the YMCA is allowed to stay in its current location and operate in all the ways YMCAs on the Eastern Shore might be called to do,\" City Planner Steve Kaii-Ziegler said at the Sept. 5 meeting.The amendment would \"create a definition for a non-commercial community recreational facility in institutionally zoned districts that better describes the current YMCA's use of the facility,\" Kaii-Ziegler said.Planning and Zoning Commissioners George Brown, A.C. Alrey, Eugene Lauer and Chair Mary Losty voted in favor of making the recommendation.Commissioners Chantay Nelson, Theresa Stafford and Vice Chair William Craig voted against making the recommendation.The original drafted ordinance, which was already introduced to city commissioners for first reading Aug. 14, would put an \"institutional overlay district\" on the YMCA at 201 Talbot Ave. If passed by City Council, the overlay would limit the institutional uses the parcel could be used for in the event the YMCA were to move. It would remain in effect for five years or until the city's next comprehensive rezoning - whichever comes first.At the Aug. 1 meeting, YMCA of the Chesapeake CEO Robbie Gill asked for a third party to review the language in the drafted ordinance to make sure the YMCA will be able to continue providing all of its programming and services.Kaii-Ziegler said city staff and the city attorney considered \"several different approaches\" to address the YMCA's concerns. The discussions resulted in this companion ordinance submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for review and recommendation, he said.\"This definition specifies that a non-commercial community recreational facility may have ancillary uses that address the concerns the YMCA has expressed,\" Kaii-Ziegler said.At the Sept. 5 meeting, Gill said he wanted to thank city staff for working with the YMCA to make sure the nonprofit can continue to serve Dorchester County. He said that the proposed overlay, without the companion ordinance, could jeopardize the YMCA's programming.\"There needs to be an added use that represents the organization's work that it's doing,\" he said.Kaii-Ziegler said the city received a letter, dated Aug. 25, from the YMCA that confirms the nonprofit's support for the original proposed overlay with the companion ordinance. He said the YMCA also sent a letter, dated Aug. 13, that states the YMCA won't enter any agreements to \"sell or convey\" the 201 Talbot Avenue property until the end of 2023.Ward 1 Planning Commissioner William Craig said he took issue with the wording of the companion text amendment.\"This needs more work as far as I'm concerned,\" Craig said. \"I don't think this wording is accurate.\" Craig said he didn't agree with the description of uses for the overlay companion ordinance.\"I think we need to get an accurate description of what the local YMCA does and then we'll deal with where it goes in the table,\" he said.No residents spoke for public comment before the commission voted on the amendment. \n \n Caption: Cambridge's YMCA is located at 201 Talbot Ave.\n \nPHOTO BY MAGGIE TROVATO \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A vicious character assassination campaign is being waged against him, his family and his legacy that follows his terms in office.He is under attack for his strong leadership resulting in Easton's secure financial standing, a thriving town that is growing at a controlled pace, and his ability to stand against pressure from outside interests that would hope to impose rapid growth and development.Following a recent letter to the editor in a local news outlet that strongly urged citizens to be angry over alleged but untrue misdeeds, two new shockingly ugly mass mailings went to every registered voter in the town of Easton.And, in a recent Facebook posting, the same bogus claims of wrongdoing while in office were written.All of the allegations are untrue, according to the town attorney.In contrast, Mr. Willey has continued his own election campaign with truth and dignity.We have seen no such attacks on the other three candidates. This is because Bob Willey has done so much for this town and residents, and his opponent is scared. As the more honorable candidate, Willey does not have to stoop to smear tactics to obtain the votes he needs to win.I would urge the citizens of Easton to stand up against this type of character assassination campaign. We don't do that here.Show your support for honorable campaigning by voting for a great candidate, Bob Willey, on Tuesday, Sept. 12.Abby LewisEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In the past, I have always declined the request to write supporting letters for any candidate.I have always held the premise that it was important to let the voters decide for the candidate of their choice on their own.I shall also share with you that I do not live in the Town of Easton and therefore cannot vote in Easton elections.We have a great community that has been well managed for years. This fact is evident when we consider the reason why so many people want to live in Easton and Talbot County. The answer is: \"It's our quality of life.\" However, this week a repulsive, expensive, glossy mailer was received by many citizens condemning Bob Willey. I have worked with Bob for many years, and you can believe me that he has always had the Town of Easton as a top priority. The person who sent that mailer is unknown to me as well as to many others with whom I have spoken. Evidently, this individual does not know Bob Willey.There is no place in our wonderful community for this type of negative campaigning.I have had citizens call me to say they were outraged about this horrible mailer, and quite frankly they admitted that they were originally not going to vote, but this has changed their minds. I can only hope our community rises above this negativity and does the right thing.THOMAS G.

Stevenson, Jr. is challenging Abner for the seat.In District 1, which has a 64% Black population, three candidates are running for two seats on the council: Darlene Hammond, Brandy James and Scott Phillips, an incumbent council member.Only two candidates are running for the two council seats in District 2: incumbent Debra Sewell and H. Torbert \"Toby\" Williamson.The new election plan, passed in June, changed the town's former at-large, staggered term election system to a two-district system that ensures more representation of Federalsburg's Black residents.The change was spurred by a federal lawsuit filed earlier this year, which contended that the former election system discriminated against Black voters by keeping them from being able to elect their chosen representatives.Under the new plan, the council members elected to Districts 1 and 2 who receive the highest number of votes will be elected to five-year terms. Council members receiving the second-highest number of votes in their respective districts will be elected to three-year terms.The next person elected as mayor will serve a five-year term.Terms for the two council members elected to threeyear terms will expire on the first Tuesday of November 2026, followed by an election for two council members, one from each district.The new council members elected in 2026 will be elected to four-year terms.Elections for council members from each district will occur every two years after.Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 26. Voting will take place at Town Hall, located at 118 N. Main Street.Residents will be able to vote for a mayor and two candidates from their district. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge OKs revised curfew for youth in city - New ordinance applies to juveniles under 16\n\n September 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 621\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - Nearly three months after Cambridge's temporary juvenile curfew ended, the city council has passed a new curfew ordinance.The curfew will last 12 months, beginning Oct. 1.It will end Sept. 30, 2024, unless it is extended or approved as part of the city code.The curfew will make it so that juveniles under 16 cannot be in a public place within the city between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. on Sundays through Thursdays and 11 p.m. through 5 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. There are exceptions to this, however, including when the juvenile is with a parent or when the juvenile is on the way home from work or a school activity.The curfew passed in a four to one vote Monday evening. All city commissioners voted in favor of reinstating the curfew except for Ward 3 Commissioner Jameson Harrington.This vote comes more than a month after Mayor Stephen Rideout vetoed another version of a curfew that commissioners had passed at an Aug. 14 meeting.The failed ordinance used the same language as the temporary curfew that was in place from February through June.The newly passed ordinance, which was drafted based on proposed amendments from Rideout, passed with a number of amendments.Rideout's drafted ordinance included the addition of definitions and alterations to language on enforcement procedures and penalties. It eliminated language that allowed parents to be fined for a child's actions.It also implemented the Children in Need of Supervision process in the event the family refuses to participate in services requested by the Local Care Team, a collaborative group of local agencies serving families. In this process, the Department of Juvenile Services would have the authority to refer the youth to appropriate services, employ a precourt supervision agreement where the youth and family agree to certain conditions like participating in services, or file a petition with the juvenile court.In September, Ward 4 Commissioner Sputty Cephas proposed amendments to Rideout's drafted curfew ordinance.Cephas' version adds a penalties section which penalizes parents if their child is given a curfew violation following an initial written warning. The penalty would be $50 for a first offense and $100 for a second offense. Three or more violations of the ordinance would be forwarded to the Dorchester County State's Attorney's Office for review and could result in \"additional crime charges against the parent.\"During the council meeting Monday, the mayor and commissioners went through Cephas' amendments line by line and voted on each one before voting on the entire amended curfew ordinance. In this process, the council voted to include Cephas' addition of a penalties section to the ordinance, including fining families for juvenile offenses. Harrington and Ward 1 Commissioner Laurel Atkiss voted against amending the ordinance to include fines. However, the amendment still passed.The council voted to include wording so that, unless the child has previously violated the ordinance, the Cambridge police chief cannot proceed with further action.After this amendment passed, Rideout clarified with the police chief, \"The fact that a child is uncooperative cannot give you any advance to do anything more about that particular case if it's a first-time offense.\"Before any action was taken on the ordinance, three residents spoke about the curfew.Jose J. Rodriguez said that a curfew needs to be in place.\"Responsibility starts with us, not with them,\" Rodriguez said about Cambridge's youth.At the end of the meeting, Atkiss thanked everyone for coming together to compromise and pass a curfew.\"I also want to be sure to remind everyone that the curfew is not the solution,\" she said. \"It's just a tool in our toolbox. We still need to address our children and our education and our housing.\" \n \n Caption: Mayor Stephen Rideout discusses the juvenile curfew ordinance at a Cambridge City Council meeting Sept. 25 at the Empowerment Center in Cambridge. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Town Attorney Lyndsey Ryan said commissioners can choose between a formal or informal process to decide if they want to renew the agreement, which expires in August of 2026. A formal process would entail the town would putting a committee of citizens together to review Breezeline's services. In an informal process, Breezeline would submit an amended franchise agreement and the town would hold a public hearing.■ Were informed that the town's comprehensive plan amendment will need to include a housing element that addresses how the town can take action to further fair housing. Town Attorney Lyndsey Ryan said the commissioners might consider putting a committee together to look into the different actions that would address this. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline Commission shares top requests with Mid-Shore delegation\n\n October 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 23 | Section: News \n \n 1104\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - The Caroline County Commission met Tuesday, Oct. 3, with five of the seven-member legislative team for state districts 36 and 37 to advance its annual \"bill requests and discussion items\" ahead of the 446th Maryland General Assembly Jan. 10 to April 8, 2024.The short list of priorities they asked legislators to support were:■ Providing supplemental funds for emergency medical transports.,■ Licensing for barbershops and beauty shops to allow one-site sales and consumption of alcoholic beverages under restricted circumstances.■ Allowing liquor-tasting and sampling in the county in addition to wine and beer tasting.■ Continuing local funding of legislative bond initiatives.■ Devising a better method of assessing electric vehicle use instead of imposing a mileage tax.The three-member commission met with the legislators for about an hour in the Health and Public Services Building in Denton.The meeting agenda was reversed, with commissioners' unanimously approving the consent agenda shortly after the 9 a.m. start time while they waited for Del. Jeff Ghrist, R-36-Caroline, to arrive. The annual presentation of the consolidated transportation program occurred at about 10:30 a.m.Besides Ghrist, attending the annual delegation meeting were state Sen. Johnny Mautz, R-37; Del. Jay Jacobs, R-36-Kent; Del. Steve Arentz, R-36-QA; and Del. Chris Adams, R-37B. Sen. Steve Hershey, R-Upper Shore, and Del. Tom Hutchinson, R-37B, were absent.Commission Vice President Larry Porter led the discussion by describing the county's critical need for help in funding emergency medical transportation.The Emergency Service Transporter Supplemental Payment Program addresses the difference between the cost per emergency transport versus the Medicaid reimbursement rate. Providers receive a supplemental payment to make up the difference, but it's not enough to cover the actual cost.Porter pointed out that \"Caroline County is a long county. It's about a two-hour turnaround time for us to pick up a patient, transport them, get them into the emergency room in Easton or Dover or Seaford, and turn around and come back.\"Because the \"program reimburses at a higher rate, we're able to keep our revenue coming in, so that we can buy the new ambulances, new equipment,\" Porter said.EMS Division Chief K.J. Marvel explained that Caroline County reimbursement for ambulance transportation per Medicaid patient is increasing from a $100 to $150. She said she was worried about the lack of clarity in the expiration date of the grant program, which was originally set to expire in 2025.ESPP is a federal program sponsored through the Maryland Department of Health, Marvel said. \"It's actually been very beneficial for us because we have a lot of Medicaid transports with our population here,\" she said.Private insurance companies and Medicare pay the rate established by the Maryland health care system.\"It's very important to us,\" Commission President Travis Breeding said. \"We do not have an emergency room in the county.\"Medicaid does not pay for transportation to urgent care or Choptank Community Health, nor for transportation back home from an emergency room, so county EMS ambulances and drivers must transport patients to hospitals and, often, back home.Marvel and Deputy County Administrator Daniel Fox told the delegation the county is not looking for an increase in funding, but a continuation of the program.The financial benefit was $723,000 last year, Marvel said. Fox said losing those funds would be \"devastating.\"\"That's what? Two, three ambulances,\" Breeding said.He said the commission wanted to make sure \"that our federal representation understands how important it is, and then also make sure that the state continues to have the regulatory and the grant writing structure in place to pass that funding through.\"The commissioners put forward requests to make three changes in the county liquor code, as recommended by the Caroline County Liquor Board. Assistant Director of Codes Crystal Dadds explained the requests.The board recommends allowing hair salons and barbershop to provide one 5-ounce glass of wine or 12-ounce beer per customer during a hair appointment, if the business were approved for an annual license fee of $100.Two other changes in the liquor code were proposed. Currently, beer and wine tastings and samplings are allowed in the county, but not the tasting and sampling of spirits. The number of two-ounce drinks per day for sampling would increase from six to nine to accommodate the typical number of three-sample flights.The commissioners requested support from the delegation for the Rural Maryland Council for fiscal year 2025. The state council, supported by the MidShore Regional Council, is requesting $9 million for rural development and projects. The funding request remains unchanged from fiscal year 2023.Though not included in the published bill requests, the commissioners voiced their concern about a proposed state mileage tax that would \"disproportionately hurt rural residents because we travel more, and residents who travel in other states,\" Ghrist said.He said the state is \"trying to figure out how to capture a use tax for EVs, but that's not the answer.\" Rather, \"the better answer would be a titling tax when somebody purchases an electric vehicle.\"\"Well, I think each day we find unintended consequences of this green energy agenda,\" Porter said. \"Whether it's danger to our firefighters and first responders or the reduction in Highway User Funds, I think it went from $4 million to $400,000. This is just another unintended consequence of this ridiculous mess.\"A discussion about rural transportation needs, infrastructure needs and costs, and differences between urban and suburban versus rural mobility ensued.\"Something to keep in mind is, no matter what they do with EVs, as far as how we address that issue, they're still heavily subsidized,\" Arentz said. \"The poor are the ones who are really going to get hammered by this. And we are not wealthy counties.\"Adams said the talk of a new tax prompted a blip on his wristwatch heart monitor. A politician who would even try to propose a new tax \"with a recession coming on and inflation going through the roof\" would have to put forth a convincing argument, he suggested.\"You can expect every person sitting at the table who represents Caroline County to push back and push back hard when it comes to raising taxes,\" Adams said.\"We need to be mindful of the economy on Main Street, not just on Wall Street,\" Mautz said. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nMid-Shore delegation members meeting with the Caroline County Commission Oct. 3 are, from left, state Sen.

    "content": "Oxford keeping investment policy\n\n October 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 645\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD - A decision to keep a decades-old financial investment policy, which the town didn't know about until recently, in place was met with applause at a Commissioners of Oxford meeting Tuesday.Commission President Tom Costigan said that while the existing policy might not be perfect, it's what the town can work with for the time being.\"I think there's consensus from a lot of people in the room and a lot of people at this table that our existing policy is a good one. We should keep it and we should follow it,\" he said, which was followed with claps from residents in attendance.The policy features three sections that are unique to Oxford.One section states that each commissioner and the clerk treasurer must disclose \"any substantial personal investment or management role in any financial institution which conducts business in Talbot County.\" Another section states that no more than half of the town's investment should be in a stable financial institution.Lewis said that other municipalities didn't necessarily state this the same way.The last section states that the length of maturity on an investment should not exceed one year.At the previous town meeting Sept. 26, Town Manager Cheryl Lewis said that Oxford has had a financial investment policy since the 1990s, which the current town officials and commissioners had not been made aware of.Lewis said that after learning about the policy, she created an updated version.She gave commissioners copies of the original policy as well a policy with her updates at the Sept. 26 meeting.After Costigan said the town should keep the existing financial policy at the Tuesday meeting, Commissioner Susan Delean-Botkin asked if they would consider looking at the small updates that Talbot County had made to its financial policy.\"Would we consider looking at that and seeing (if) there (is) anything we need to address?\" she asked.Costigan said the commissioners could look at \"anything,\" but said that right now, the plan is to stick with what is already in place.Commissioner Katrina Greer said she was thrilled to keep the existing policy in place.During the meeting, commissioners briefly discussed whether to create a Budget and Finance Committee.During the last meeting, Greer had asked to discuss a resolution to create the committee, which she drafted.Commissioners agreed to discuss it at the meeting Tuesday.However, because Greer wanted to go through the language, Costigan suggested the commissioners hold a workshop next week to discuss the resolution.Greer said she would be happy with that, as long as the meeting was in the evening, rather than in the afternoon, so that more residents can attend.Town Attorney Lyndsey Ryan said she envisions that commissioners would discuss what they anticipate the committee would do at the workshop so that she can draft something to be put on the agenda for the next regular town meeting.Delean-Botkin said the first question the commissioners have to decide is whether the committee is necessary.\"Having gone through 40 phone calls of other entities on the Shore, Rockville, Frederick Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, Talbot County, Easton, Trappe, Salisbury, Cambridge, Denton, all the school boards - none of them have a citizens budget advisory committee,\" Delean-Botkin said. \"When I asked the aldermen, councilmen, committee members and board members why not, it is because it is the duty of the sworn officials to manage the budget and finances is in every entity's charter.\" In response, Greer said Annapolis does have a Finance Committee.Costigan said the commissioners should first decide what the committee would be.\"Let's first define what it is and then we'll decide whether we need it or not,\" he said. \"And we can vote on whether we want it or not.\" The commissioners workshop will be held Thursday, Oct. 19, at 5 p.m. in the Commissioners of Oxford meeting room. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nCommissioner Susan Delean-Botkin speaks at a Commissioners of Oxford meeting Oct. 10. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The $208,000 project includes the implementation of countdown pedestrian signals.Baker also mentioned the new sidewalk on Bayly road, which runs between Maces Lane and Governors Avenue, that will make the road safer for pedestrians and bicyclists.Currently, the State Highway Association is doing an intersection study at Maryland Route 343 and Maces Lane to see what safety enhancements it might need to employ at that intersection, according to a press release from MDOT.Bob Munroe, Maryland Port Administration deputy executive director of administration and environment, talked about the Mid-Chesapeake Bay Ecosystem Restoration project. The project, in partnership with the U.S.Army Corps of Engineers and located in Dorchester County, will create shoreline protection for the county by using dredged material from shipping channels to rebuild James and Barren islands.\"On a macro-level, this project will give the state much needed Chesapeake Bay sediment replacement capacity for the next 30 years,\" Munroe said during the meeting. \"Locally, we believe that the MidBay island restoration will help reduce storm-related shoreline erosion for up to 30% on the upper Hoopers Island area and the areas north of Fishing Creek.\" Munroe added that he believes the project will also increase overall property values in the county by more than $1 million.This is in part due to a reduced rate of energy and improved water quality.Barren Island construction has already begun and James Island construction is set to begin in 2025, Munroe said.These projects are a part of MDOT's six-year draft Consolidated Transportation Program, a $21.2 billion investment plan for the state's transportation system. According to the press release, the plan will be finalized and submitted in January for consideration of the General Assembly. MDOT is meeting with all of Maryland's counties and Baltimore City to discuss the plan.According to the press release from MDOT, allocations for Dorchester County in the draft Consolidated Transportation Program also include $919,000 to support local transit operations provided by Delmarva Community Transit, $123,000 to help Delmarva Community Services install a propane station for propanepowered vehicles and $337,000 to help fund HVAC improvements at the Cambridge-Dorchester Regional Airport terminal.During the meeting, the County Council presented a list of priorities it hopes MDOT can address, including traffic improvements, pedestrian and safety improvements around the county.These include:▪ Traffic and geometric improvements at the Maryland Route 392 and Route 14 intersection.▪ A pipe replacement on Maryland Route 336.▪ Pedestrian improvements on Maryland Route 392 through Hurlock.▪ Railroad crossing improvements at Indiantown Road and Maryland Route 331.▪ Turn lane improvements to Maryland Route 16 at Mount Holly Road.▪ Pavement marking updates in Cambridge.▪ Painting the jersey walls on Malkus Bridge.▪ A full-function intersection on westbound U.S.50 at Chateau Road.▪ Rumble strips on Mount Holly Road.▪ Visibility improvements on the drawbridge in Cambridge.The city of Cambridge and town of East New Market also submitted a list to the county to be presented to MDOT. Their lists include changes to the intersection at Maces Lane and Washington Street in Cambridge and assistance with speeding in East New Market, among other items.After hearing the presentations from MDOT officials, council members shared their comments with the officials.Council member Ricky Travers talked about the change in road width on Maryland Route 335.He said the road width changes by about 2 or 3 feet on either side.\"I really think the state needs to take a strong look at that,\" he said.Council President Lenny Pfeffer and Vice President Mike Detmer thanked the State Highway Administration District Engineer Mark Crampton.\"I wanted to thank you so much for answering emails and questions and concerns of the council in general and our citizens when they talk,\" Pfeffer said. \"Mark has been phenomenal in customer service [and] getting back to us with answers, whether it's something we like to hear or something we don't.\" Detmer said the work Crampton and his team have done means a lot to him and to the residents of Dorchester County.\"From the little to the big, your local team here has been very exemplary in helping us,\" he said to the MDOT officials. \n \n Caption: SCREENSHOT FROM DORCHESTER COUNTY COUNCIL MEETING\n \nMaryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld speaks to the Dorchester County Council during a council meeting in Cambridge Oct. 3. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton Town Council vote on cannabis moratorium delayed - Tabled measure leads to heated discussion among council members\n\n October 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 710\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - A move by Easton Town Council President Frank Gunsallus to continue a hearing on a proposed cannabis moratorium drew strong reactions from other council members.A tense back-and-forth exchange between Gunsallus and Ward 3 Councilman David Montgomery toward the end of Monday's council meeting stemmed from the council president's executive decision to delay a vote on the moratorium for an additional three weeks.The nine-month moratorium on cannabis businesses, introduced this summer, was originally slated for a public hearing and vote at the council's Sept.18 meeting. The matter had been tabled until Monday so all five council members could be present to vote.The moratorium, if passed, would place a pause on applications, approval, construction, expansion, processing or issuance of building permits for a business that grows, processes or sells cannabis within the Easton town limits.The moratorium would also allow the town to consider and adopt a revised zoning ordinance.Easton's existing zoning ordinance already contains definitions and permitted zoning districts for medical cannabis dispensaries and growing and processing facilities, but does not include language on standards for recreational facilities.Montgomery strongly objected to Gunsallus' continuance, saying the council president did not have the authority to do so. Gunsallus affirmed that he did.\"Sir, you will contain yourself please,\" Gunsallus said, speaking over Montgomery, who started to make a comment.Gunsallus reaffirmed he had the power to continue discussion on the moratorium until the next meeting, explaining that he wanted to wait until the town's planning commission made an additional recommendation later in the week.However, in August, the commission unanimously gave a favorable recommendation to approve the ordinance.Montgomery called for a vote on the continuance, questioning Gunsallus' authority.\"The fact that four of us could reveal that we want to vote now means nothing to you, that you will override the wishes of the council because you are sitting there as the town council president,\" he said.Town Attorney Sharon Van Emburgh chimed in, saying the council can override the president's action. But in the past, the council has typically given members additional time to vote as a courtesy.Montgomery pointed out that the council had already given an additional month for consideration.Gunsallus reemphasized the upcoming planning commission meeting would provide more clarifying information.\"Excuse me, what information will that be?\" Montgomery said.\"(The planning commission's) recommendations, as I've stated, so please contain yourself - you've already spoken more than permissible,\" Gunsallus said.Montgomery motioned to overrule Gunsallus and vote on the ordinance as presented.Ward 2 Councilman Don Abbatiello interjected, saying while he understood Montgomery and \"definitely\" disagreed with how the decision had been handled, he agreed that granting additional time to decide was in line with past council actions.Mayor Megan Cook, a former council president herself, interrupted the quarreling, calling for the councilmen to settle down.\"I agree that we are a group of five where you all are independent and you all have various opinions - absolutely.We must respect ourselves - the fighting, we need to\" she said, trailing off and moving her arms to motion to calm down.\"Please.\" Ward 4 Councilman Rev.Elmer Davis Jr. initially seconded the motion, rescinding his vote just minutes later to agree with Abbatiello's stance on the council's precedent. He voiced worry with how the situation was handled.\"We have never had such a dialogue that we had tonight regarding issues and concerns,\" he said. \"That dialogue - I'm quite concerned about things that have been said, I've never seen this on this council in all my days.\" The council will again table voting on the ordinance until its Monday, Nov. 6, meeting.Uncertainty still remains on the moratorium. During Monday's meeting, council members and town residents raised questions on the moratorium's duration, specifics on licensing for both recreational and medical facilities and zoning laws for both types of establishments.The Easton Planning Commission will discuss zoning requirements for adult-use cannabis dispensaries at its Thursday, Oct. 19, meeting. \n \n Caption: COURTESY TOWN OF EASTON\n \nEaston Town Council President Frank Gunsallus pauses his comments during a tense moment at the Monday, Oct. 16 council meeting.\n \nCOURTESY TOWN OF EASTON\n \nWard 3 Councilman David Montgomery, left, prepares to make a comment during a tense exchange at a council meeting Monday, Oct. 16.\n \nCOURTESY TOWN OF EASTON\n \nEaston Mayor Megan Cook gestures with her hands for the council members to settle down. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Residents a no show to listening session - Cambridge City Council to vote on ward realignment\n\n October 19, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: A5 | Section: News \n \n 721\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - Only city staff and committee members showed up to a Cambridge Ward Realignment Listening Session on Thursday, Oct. 12.The city's residents, who the informal meeting was intended for, were not present at the City Council Chambers that evening.Neither the Ward Realignment Committee members nor city staff were surprised by this, though.\"The people who aren't affected looked at the map, said 'That ain't me. Ok,\"'Ward Realignment Committee member Lou Hyman hypothesized.The ward changes, which the committee proposes Cambridge City Council vote to make, would affect less than 3% ofCambridge's population.According to a news release from the city, the committee is proposing:⯀Moving the area bounded by Locust Street, Oakley Street, Park Lane and Willis Street from Ward 1 to Ward 3.⯀Moving the area bounded by Robbins Street, Maces Lane, Bradley Avenue and High Street from Ward 2 to Ward 4.⯀Moving the area bounded byVirginia Avenue, Peachblossom Avenue, Washington Street, Front Street, Brohawn Avenue and Perimore Street from Ward 3 to Ward 5.■ Moving the area bounded by Washington Street, Peachblossom Avenue, Boundary Avenue and Front Street from Ward 4 to Ward 5.These changes would make it so that each ward has a population size within the lawful plus or minus 5% range of the city's mean population.Wards must be within this range for elections.According to city council documents, there are currently more residents in Ward 1 than the range allows and fewer residents in Ward 5 than the range allows.At the end of the listening session, the committee voted unanimously to move forward with its proposal as is.\"Well, we did not hear anything in the listening session that would make me think we should change (our proposal),\" Committee Member Tal-ibah Chikwendu said, referencing the absence of residents and causing those at the meeting to laugh.\"So I can't see a reason to make any additional changes.\"Following the committee's vote to move forward, the city will draft a resolution to be put on the City Council's next meeting agenda for a first reading. In November, the City Council will hold a formal public hearing for the the resolution.Ifthe City Council passes the resolution, the city will communicate the changes to the Board of Elections, who will then notify the residents affected.The majority ofthe meeting, however, was spent talking about how to achieve more engagement from residents on different city issues.Chikwendu said residents who would be affected by the proposed changes might have showed up to the listening session ifthey had been notified of the potential impact via mail.\"We could have gotten people here ifwe had been specific in the targets,\" she said.Chikwendu also said having more diverse wards could facilitate increased community engagement with the city, overall.\"It would have impacted a whole lot more people, but we could have actually created more diverse wards and still maintained the balance that we needed to to not be in violation,\" she said.Because the committee didn't have more time, it opted for the \"next best thing,\" Chikwendu said, adding that there is nothing wrong with its proposal.\"But ifwe're talking about trying to get more and more people invested to show up for things like that and to do things that we talk about need to be done, we need to, first of all, give people reasons to start to talk to people who aren't like them,\" she said.Having grown up in Cambridge, Chikwendu acknowledged that there are other obstacles to increasing community engagement.\"In general, people who live here don't like people who came here later to tell us what to do,\" she said. \"If they're people who aren't (lifelong) Cambridge residents saying it, it's going to be hard to get people to listen.\"Committee Vice Chair Greg Meekins said education is fundamental in growing engagement.\"We're not building up another set ofleaders,\" he said about Cambridge. \"That's critical.\"Meekins also said marketing is important.\"We've got a large segment of the population in poverty,\" he said. \"And ifwe are going to be intentional about reaching them, we've got to create the material that's going to hit them square in the face in a very positive way.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nCambridge Ward Realignment Committee Chair Jim Sicks talks at a Ward Realignment Listening Session Oct. 12.

The pump track is complete, Cook said.While workers were smoothing concrete earlier this week, two young scooter drivers were whipping around the curves that had already been finished.\"This park is really nice,\" said Ryder Cario, an Easton High School freshman who came to be one of the first participants at this park. \"It is a lot better than what we had before.\" Fellow EHS freshman Emmett Rogan joined Cario at the park. The helmeted duo made their scooters move like surfboards on a wave. After each lap, they took a break, panting and smiling.The workers seemed happy that these kids were using their creation, adding to the complex's existing playgrounds and athletic fields, though workers said they were on tight deadlines and quick expectations to install everything.But for now, this windfall is a win for scooter and skateboard lovers alike.Work on other projects is also progressing steadily.Cook shared brief updates on the status of other projects, including the Brewer's Lane dog park and parking lot, the Hunter's Mill playground, field lights installation at North Easton Park and parks storage buildings. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nRyder Cario, left, and Emmett Rogan, two Easton High freshmen, were among the first to check out the newly built skate park in North Easton Sports Complex off of Washington Street.\n \nTOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nWorkers from Reliable Concrete Services, LLC put the finishing touches on some walkways near the skate park.\n \nTOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nEmmett Rogan goes skyward at the newly created skate park.

Governor Aruna Miller greeted leaders of the Queen Anne's County Democratic Party for a short meet and greet before speaking to the awaiting audience of supporters.\"We have our work cut out for us,\" said Frank Alduino, member of the Democratic Central Committee in Queen Anne's County, when asked how support for the Democrats was faring.The Queen Anne's County Democratic Central Committee held what will now be their annual Unity Dinner, at the center on Saturday evening, Oct. 14, providing Democrats across the county and state the opportunity to meet.Jordan Himes, political director for the Maryland Democratic Party, attended the event to \"make sure we get as unified as we can as Democrats.\" In his introduction of Miller, Himes, whose grandmother is from the Eastern Shore and attended school in the Kennard Center, site of the former Kennard High School, said he was brought up knowing that you can never have the absence of hope.\"I encourage everyone here to use your voice,\" Himes said.\"One voice can change one person, a person can change the county, the county can change the state, the state can change the country, and the country can change the world.\" In 2022, Maryland saw the most diverse ticket that's ever won in the history of Maryland. Miller thanked the audience for their support of the Moore/Miller ticket, which won by the most votes in Maryland's history, and they were the only two people of color who ever won the office together in the United States.Miller told the audience they didn't vote for the Moore/Miller ticket to be the status quo.\"You all wanted us to move boldly, decisively, and deliberately for all Marylanders,\" the lieutenant governor said. \"You elected us to leave no one left behind.\" Miller assured the crowd they had heard the voices of rural voters who told them that the only time they saw elected officials was during a campaign year. Because of this, Miller says, Gov.Moore has decided to coordinate a tour bus of his entire cabinet to travel to every Maryland county and listen to the concerns of voters.Touting the success of the legislative session, Miller said the administration worked on raising the minimum wage, increasing services to Maryland veterans, providing high school seniors with a yearlong, post-grad service option, increasing broadband services in rural areas and ensuring training for abortion care providers.\"Things don't just happen, they are made to happen,\" Miller said. \"We are fighting for equity and freedom.

JeffLankford, business and marketing coordinator ofEaston Airport, said the last tenant to go will be the Talbot County Sheriff's office this coming summer.\"Ifyou go down Glebe road to Mistletoe, that is where the old Avon Dixon Building is,\" said Lankford. \"The county purchased that and they are turning it into the Talbot Center.\"\"At the end of the day, they decided the solution would be to purchase the old Black and Decker building, demolish it and shift everything down. There will also be some grading that has to be done. There is an incredible amount ofdirt that is going to have to be brought. Ifyou look from the TCBC it really looks like a bowl from that vantage point to the airport.\"According to the Easton Airport website, 90% of the funding will come from Federal Aviation Administration grants. The Maryland Aviation Administration will contribute five of the remaining 10%, and the Easton Airport has to cover the final five %, which is around $2.6 million dollars.Lankford said that in 30 years of running the airport, they are confident they can cover their share. Talbot County owns and operates the airport.There was a 12 year assessment for the project that went from2006 to 2018. It was determined that to comply with FAA safety standards, both ends ofthe runway had to be expanded, so that ifan incoming plane misses the mark, there is a soft landing zone.FAAs bipartisan infrastructure law establishing these standards made getting the upgrades completed more urgent, Lankford said.According to the website, \"Easton Airport has no plans to purchase and demolish any homes, will not extend the runway towards Route 50 and will not extend the runway towards Goldsborough Neck Road.\"Frank Gunsallus, president of Easton Town Council, who was at the groundbreaking, said, \"They are prioritizing safety. That is the whole reason for this project. So essentially they are going to shift the runway further down the property to be in compliance with the FAA requirements and to update and modernize equipment being used.\" Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Operations and Management of Hunt Valley, an engineering, consulting and project management firm, has been contracted for the work. They have over 50,000 employees and are on the NY Stock Exchange.Among the project's first steps will be establishing an impermanent fence going up by Glebe Road and the bypass. It will be like that for a couple of years until demolition is complete, Lankford said.The airportjust celebrated 80 years. And, Lankford hopes, the planned improvements will provide the community with infrastructure to last for the next 80 years.EASTON - The Easton Airport is making some safety changes to their main runway that will demolish the Talbot County Business Center to make room. Although their will be many upgrades like LED lights instead ofthe ones that were placed there in the 40s and multiple new on ramps, the main airfield modernization program is to build 1,000 feet ofgrass at each end of runway 4/22. They will also grade the area level to each end of their runway that runs roughly north and south.On the south end is the TCBC. It is lower than the airport runway. So they are taking dirt from sources around the airport and from offsite to make this $52 million multiyear project level. Most ofthe tenants of the TCBC have already left. Jeff Lankford, business and marketing coordinator of Easton Airport, said the last tenant to go will be the Talbot County Sheriff's office this summer.\"Ifyou go down Glebe road to Mistletoe, that is where the old Avon Dixon Building is. The county purchased that and they are turning it into the Talbot Center,\" said Lankford.Lankford said, \"At the end ofthe day, they decided the solution would be to purchase the old Black and Decker building. Demolish it and shift everything down. There will also be some grading that has to be done. There is an incredible amount ofdirt that is going to be have to be brought. If you look from the TCBC it really looks like a bowl from that vantage point to the airport.\"He said, \"The south end will have dirt brought in next year to bring it up to the same elevation as the current runway. Then they have to let that sit for about a year.\"According to the Easton Airport website, %90 ofthe funding will come from Federal Aviation Administration grants. The Maryland Aviation Administration contributes %5 and the Easton Airport has to cover the final %5 which is around $2.6 million dollars. Lankford said that in 30 years ofrunning the airport, they are confident they can cover their share. Talbot County owns and operates the airport.This has been a long process. There was a 12 year assessment that went from 2006 to 2018. It was determined that to comply with FAA safety standards, both ends of the runway had to be expanded. The thinking is that if an incoming plane misses the mark, there is a soft landing zone. Also an airplane taking off has extra room at the end of the runway. According to Lankford it works in both emergency situations. This has never happened in Easton. The bipartisan infrastructure law made getting the upgrades completed more urgent.According to the website, \"Easton Airport has no plans to purchase and demolish any homes, will not extend the runway towards route 50 and will not extend the runway towards Goldsborough Neck Road.\"Frank Gunsallus President ofEaston Town Council, who was at the groundbreaking, said, \"They are prioritizing safety. That is the whole reason for this project. So essentially they are going to shift the runway further down the property. To be in compliance with the FAA requirements and to update and modernize equipment being used.\"AECOM ofHunt Valley is actually doing the work. The are an engineering, consulting and project management firm. AECOM stands for Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Operations and Manage-ment. They have over 50,000 employees and are on the NY Stock Exchange.Citizens will first notice this project with an impermanent fence going up by Glebe Road and the bypass. It will be like that for a couple of years until demolition is complete Lankford said.The airport just celebrated 80 years. He thinks it will help the community in that it provides infrastructure for the next 80 years. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF THE EASTON AIRPORT\n \nA large group of Easton and Talbot County officials perform a ground breaking on October 13 at the Easton Airport.\n \nTOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nAs seen from the air traffic control tower, the main runway, 4/22, goes from the left side to the upper right. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Juvenile services department to move detained girls, again\n\n October 25, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Steph Quinn; Capital News Service | Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 1363\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS - Maryland's Department ofJuvenile Services will relocate girls awaiting court hearings or long-term placement this month from a single unit of the Cheltenham Youth Detention Center, a facility that previously housed only boys, to a center the agency says will house all girls in the agency's residential care.The move is designed to correct problems highlighted in a series of reports by the Juvenile Justice Monitoring Unit in the state Office of the Attorney General.The reports revealed that four moves of detained girls and one move ofgirls in long-term placement over seven months in 2022 disrupted school, led to longer and more frequent periods of confinement and isolation, delayed medical services and exposed girls to sexual harassment.But it's unclear whether the change to an all-girl facility will impact the inequities experienced by girls in Maryland's youth detention system.\"They just treat these girls like chattel, moving them constantly from one place to another without thinking of how it will impact them,\" a staffer told a JJMU investigator in early 2023.\"They are just replicating the streets here, it's like survival every day,\" said a mental health therapist to an investigator during the same period. While all DJS long-term placement facilities are meant to offer treatment, the therapist told the investigator that the facility was too \"short-handed\" to do so.A 19-year-old at the facility, the Victor Cullen Center in rural northern Frederick County, said to an investigator, \"There is nothing treatment-oriented about this program.\"DJS has housed detained girls from most of the state at Cheltenham and all girls in long-term committed placement at Cullen since October 2022. The department said that after girls at Cheltenham are moved to the Western Maryland Children's Center in Hagerstown later this month, girls committed by the courts to DJS care will join them \"at a later date.\"Boys currently detained at WMCC will be moved to DJS residential facilities closest to their home communities, the department said. The department also indicated that WMCC staff are receiving training in \"gender-responsive programming and trauma-informed care.\"Girls and young women comprise a small portion ofyouth confined in DJS detention and treatment centers. For fiscal year 2022, DJS reported average daily populations of 10 girls in detention and 12 in court-ordered committed placement. The number of girls sent to detention from juvenile court in the course of a given year is much higher, though it has decreased each year since 2018, from 437 to 91 in 2022.The department's repeated moves of detained and committed girls in 2022 followed over a decade of debate and activism about how DJS should serve girls in its custody.In March 2022, DJS closed the Thomas J.S. Waxter Children's Center in Laurel and moved detained girls to the Alfred D. Noyes Children's Center in Rockville, which the department had refurbished to serve as a girls' facility. The monitoring unit had been calling for Waxter's closure since 2007, stating that it was \"virtually impossible to improve the physical plant sufficiently to make it suitable for a secure detention program.\" A 2010 bill in the House of Delegates that would have closed Waxter died in committee.The Juvenile Services secretary at the time, Donald DeVore, told CNS he couldn't close Waxter because it would mean placing girls in a facility with boys.\"If I close Waxter, the other facilities I have are for boys. Where do I put the girls? I would hate to stuff them in two wings (in a facility) where I have boys,\" DeVore told CNS in 2010.Just one month after the move to Noyes, the girls were moved again, this time into a 12-cell unit at Cheltenham after an air handler unit caught fire. The girls returned to Noyes in late May but were moved back to Cheltenham in October, this time to address a staffing shortage that had reached a crisis level. Cheltenham staff had been working back-to-back double shifts to reach the level of coverage required by departmental policy.Girls at Cheltenham awaiting court-ordered secure placement were sent to Cullen, the center in Frederick County.Keeping girls and boys separated at Cheltenham created new problems:■Delayed medical care:Girls at Cheltenham did not have access to the facility infirmary because boys are housed there. A girl experiencing withdrawal symptoms in early 2023 was transported from Cheltenham to WMCC in Hagerstown, almost 100 miles away, because her condition required monitoring.■Disrupted school:Persistent staff shortages at Cheltenham led to shortened or canceled school days. A special education teacher who had taught at Noyes quit in late 2022 after several years of service, partly due to her increased commute to Cheltenham with no definite end date, according to JJMU.■Increased isolation and confinement:During a COVID-19 outbreak in late 2022, a lack of space to quarantine girls meant that girls who tested positive isolated in their cells for 23 hours a day for five to seven days, according to the monitoring unit. After seven days isolating in her cell, one girl \"destroyed her room.\" Staff asked another youth to comfort the girl from the hallway.■Heightened conflict between girls:Staff separated girls into groups that took turns in a dayroom and small TV room, as well as going to school, to manage tensions. One girl told a JJMU investigator that all the noise made her feel anxious. She said, \"It's so crazy here. It's so hard to concentrate in school because it is so loud, and loud noises are my trigger.\" A pregnant girl who was assaulted twice indicated, \"Me and my child feel threatened.\"■ Exposed girls to sexual harassment:Two girls reported in early 2023 that a boy made repeated lewd comments and gestures when they were all in school. The boy moved his hand over his crotch and told the girls to perform a sexual favor and referred to the girls pleasuring themselves with tampons.In its report on the first quarter of 2023, JJMU wrote, \"Relegating detained girls and young women to a single unit in a secure detention facility set up to serve boys and young men indicates a lack of appropriate planning and dedication of resources and arguably demonstrates a casual disregard for the well-being of girls in DJS custody.\"At Cullen, shortages and lack of continuity of staff interfered in girls' mental health care, according to JJMU's report for the second quarter of2023. The report described how one girl who experienced suicidal ideation was \"ejected\" from the program at Cullen and sent to a secure detention center for a month to \"stabilize her.\"The girl had told staff that she thought no one loved her and that she had nowhere to go after Cullen.DJS, Moroney and other advocates of girls in the youth legal system agree that a new facility for girls is not the way to provide genuine treatment.DJS acknowledged in its response to JJMU's first quarter 2023 report - the first of the new administration - that girls' needs were not being met at Cheltenham or Cullen, but said that the number of girls in its residential facilities - 13 in secure detention and 4 in commitment on June 1,2023 - was too small \"to invest a large amount of resources into correctional facilities dedicated to girls.\" \"The answer is not simply to provide dedicated space and gender specific treatment, although those things are important,\" DJS wrote in its response. \"It is the institutional model itself that is failing these young women.\"In the Maryland House Judiciary Committee meeting in September, DJS Secretary Vincent Schiraldi voiced the aim of expanding Maryland's range of services for youth, which he told lawmakers has deteriorated over the past eight years.But justice reform advocates differ on whether the department is equipped to divert girls to community-based services and treatment.Schiraldi told lawmakers that DJS has adequate resources to develop Maryland's community-based offerings.But JJMU indicated in its first quarter 2023 report that there is \"a shortage and lack of variety and specialization\" in Maryland's community-based programming for girls.Moroney said that although relocating incarcerated girls to their own facility is a positive step, corrections-oriented facilities are not suitable spaces for young people to receive treatment.\"We would prefer that the girls not be incarcerated in the first place,\" Moroney said. \"But I guess if courts and the police cause kids to go to a jail-like situation, then having their own place is a better situation than being shoehorned into a boys' place.\" \n \n Caption: CAPITAL NEWS SERVICE ILLUSTRATION/STEPH QUINN \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The purpose of this hearing is to solicit public comment on various proposed amendments to Chapter 28 of the Town Code (Zoning). Specifically, twelve amendments addressing a variety of issues are proposed The purpose of the proposed amendments is to correct oversights/omissions resulting from the original enactment of the comprehensive update of the Zoning Code completed in November of 2021, based upon the Planning Commission and staff's experiences in working with this new document.The public is hereby invited to comment on the proposed amendments.Such comments may be either submitted in writing at any time prior to the Hearing, or made in person at the Hearing. The complete packet of specific amendments is on file in the office of the Town Planner and is available for public inspection during normal business hours and may also be found on the Town of Easton's website (www.Eastonmd.gov). In general terms, the proposed amendments address the following issues:· The addition of Short-Term Housing as a Use in Table 312 A, the MXW USe Table.· Revisions to Table 2.1, the overall Table of Permissible Uses, with a focus on Uses 103.1 - 103.9, the \"Middle Housing\" use types.· The deletion of the supplemental standard which requires a 1,000 foot separation of liquor stores (and other uses, by reference) from certain other uses.· Revision to the examples of non-material changes to Planned Unit Development (PUD) projects.· Revision of the wording of existing language regarding architectural styles associated with multi-family apartment complexes, and clarification that certain of the supplemental standards for this use are not applicable to projects in the Central Business Zoning District.· The addition of a new supplemental standard applicable to all middle housing types intended to insure that any such use remains of an appropriate height in the context of the neighborhood in which it is proposed.· Clarification that graphics included in the definitions of Middle Housing types are for illustrative purposes only.· The addition of the use \"Any Middle Housing Type or Variation not listed above\", and associated supplemental standards, to enable consideration of a middle housing type not contemplated or described by the existing list of such uses.· Revision to the language describing how expired or soon-expiring PUD projects may be treated.· The correction of an inadvertent redundancy of the use \"Live-Work Unit\" in the Zoning Code.· Revisions to the language prohibiting the enactment of negative use restrictions concerning grocery stores by exempting grocery stores of less than 15,000 square feet from any such use restrictions.In addition, the Town Council solicits the public's input on two potential revisions to the draft amendments that the Planning Commission has forwarded. These are:· Continuing to maintain the more intense Middle Housing types as Special Exception uses in some zoning districts. This would mean Cottage Courts, Townhouses, Mansion Apartments, and Courtyard Buildings would remain SE in the R-10A and R-7A zoning districts, but would be outright permitted in the CB District. Fourplex stacked and triplex stacked would become outright permitted uses in all zoning districts.· Revising the language concerning the expiration of PUD approvals to allow for an initial approval of three years or a longer period if specifically requested and approved by the Town Council pursuant to their legislative approval (rather than the current two years).Persons wishing to attend or participate in the public hearing who require special accommodations or assistance because of a disability should contact the Town Clerk, Kathy Ruf at the Town Office, telephone number (410) 822-2525 during normal business hours by October 30, 2023.Kathy M.

    "content": "'It felt like we were abandoned' - Management working to address problems at Altair Apartments as residents seek housing elsewhere\n\n November 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1489\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - In August, everything came to a head at Altair Apartments.Trash piled high outside the apartments on Greenwood Avenue for an entire week. Broken water heaters and air conditioners couldn't be fixed. Even the internet stopped working.Resident Rodaisia Brummell said she felt disgusted.\"It felt like we were abandoned,\" Brummell said. \"Like they didn't really care about us.\" The reason for these conditions: its new California-based management company, FPI Management, hadn't been paying all of the bills since taking over the property in April.Property Manager Judkya Murray said that overtime, vendors stopped showing up, causing trash to build up and plumbing to remain broken.She said the problem was all caused by one person at FPI Management, who has since been let go. That one person wasn't paying the bills to keep everything at Altair running. FPI Management could not be reached for comment.\"I was literally sitting here pulling my hair out because we had no internet,\" Murray said. \"We had no phones. I couldn't call anybody.I couldn't email anybody.\" At the time, Murray was the assistant property manager acting as the property manager. The previous property manager had left for another opportunity, Murray said.The week the garbage trucks didn't show, Murray remembers the garbage being so plentiful that the building's maintenance worker had to take garbage cans from inside the building to fill with the overflowing trash outside.\"We were trying to do everything we could possibly do to keep the trash contained somewhere,\" she said. \"It was just too much trash.\" The building's staff was quitting left and right.\"Nobody really wanted to leave but it's like, the conditions - you have no choice but to leave,\" Murray said.Even Murray quit.However, in about three weeks, she was back.\"The senior director of FPI (Management), she actually reached out to me one day,\" Murray said. \"She was like, 'Can you please come have lunch with me.'\" At the lunch, Murray explained why she quit and said the senior director told her they were already working to let go of and replace the the person within the company that hadn't been paying the bills for months.With that conversation, Murray agreed to come back in early October, this time as the official property manager.Having a boss who pays the bills has made Murray's job easier since coming back, she said. But she still has a significant list of to-dos and goals, especially because so many people quit a few months ago.In mid-October, Murray said she has hired a new assistant and interviewed a potential new maintenance worker.\"And if we hire him, we'll just need one other maintenance guy and we'll be fully staffed,\" she said. \"Once we're fully staffed, everything flows perfectly.\" Murray also has some big picture goals in the works to increase occupancy and create new community programming.She is working to increase the property's occupancy rate by filling the vacant apartments. Of Altair's 144 total units, Murray said 20 are vacant. She hopes to bring the occupancy rate from 86% to 94% by the end of the year.While the waitlist of applicants is \"a mile long,\" Murray said maintenance has to get the apartments fixed up and ready before new residents can move in.PROBLEMS PROMPT RESIDENTS TO LOOK ELSEWHEREWhile Murray is taking applications to fill apartment vacancies, Millie Lewis and her husband Willie are filling out applications for other apartments in Cambridge. After more than 40 years of living in the Altair Apartments, the Lewises are tired of dealing with the problems.Recently, they dealt with the outcome of a recent water leak, which affected their kitchen, living room and bathroom. In all three rooms, water spilled out from the ceiling. In the kitchen and bathroom, water filled in the ceiling lights.The edges of the carpeting against one wall in the living room has turned from beige to rusted brown.For years, even before the leak, the carpeting in Lewis' bedroom has been coming undone from the floor.Lewis covers these spaces - where pockets of air separate the carpeting and the floor - with small area rugs. She said Altair won't fix this issue, even though she has complained about it.Although the ceilings were patched up by maintenance following the leak, it took weeks and a citation from the city for the mold, which grew from one of those patched up spots in the bathroom, to be removed.Lewis has COPD and asthma, which made her even more concerned about being in a home where there is mold in the bathroom that she and her husband use everyday.\"I pay my rent every month,\" she said. \"Before I'm supposed to pay it.Why can't the head people do their job? Why can't they pay? Why can't they take care of what's got to be taken care of at these apartments hereft\" Lewis isn't the only resident looking to live elsewhere.Tieonna Wisher, who has lived at Altair for three years, said she has already filled out an application for another apartment.She has concerns about how long it takes for management to respond to problems.Wisher has a hole in her wall that she said management hasn't done anything about for months.\"They keep saying they're going to come in here,\" she said.Wisher remembers one day when she unplugged a cord from a socket in her home and it sparked and caused half of the lights to go out in her apartment.\"They told me to call the emergency number,\" she said. \"Call it and nobody answers. Go to the office.Like, nobody wants to do nothing.\" Brummell, who has lived at Altair for over a year, said she has also started submitting housing applications.In the time that she's lived here, Brummell has experienced a months-long leak in her bathroom and a leaking dishwasher. She said that when her dishwasher was leaking, all maintenance did was drop off a shop vac. She has yet to receive a working dishwasher.It took about three months before Brummell could get someone to fix the leak in her bathroom. She said that gnats are still flying around the apartment because of it.A mother of two young kids, Brummell has noticed her children keep getting sick. She fears it is from the building. The one time she saw mold in her home, a previous property manager told her to spray it with bleach.\"That's all she told me to do,\" Brummell said.THE CITY's INVOLVEMENTTo get problems solved, Brummell said she has started reaching out to the City of Cambridge. She said this has been effective because code enforcement can fine Altair for property violations.\"A couple weeks ago (workers hired by management) came in and painted and fixed my stuff that was supposed to be fixed,\" she said. \"Only because I called the City of Cambridge.Because, if I didn't call them, it wouldn't have been that.\" Cambridge Assistant City Manager Brandon Hesson said a goal of the city is to solve quality of life issues.\"That's not always going to be possible from the outside of homes,\" he said.\"We need to get people to the point where (residents) trust us and they are contacting us and they're aware of their tenants rights and they're ability to call us about issues they're having with their rental homes and their apartments.\" Hesson said they have been able to do this at Altair and are \"still very present.\" Since August, Hesson said communication with upper management has been satisfactory. He said they shared an action plan with multiple items they plan to address. As of Nov. 3, Hesson said he was still waiting to see if they are following that plan.Hesson clarified that communication with Altair's on-site management \"has always been pretty good.\" Murray said she is making sure that she stays in communication with the city.\"I know their biggest thing is nobody was communicating anything back to them,\" she said about the city. \"They just need to know if somebody's on top of (a problem).\" With all of the issues at Altair, Brummell said residents are paying rent and not getting the services they should be getting as tenants.\"Everything's being prolonged,\" she said. \"But ya'll want things from us. You want rent money from us.You want us to go in the house at a certain time. But we're not getting the things that we properly need.\" \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nJudkya Murray, Altair Apartments property manager, was so frustrated with surmounting issues that she quit.

MICHAELS - The Commissioners of St. Michaels took action on three new items at its meeting on Wednesday.▪ The Commissioners voted unanimously to enter into an agreement between Mid Shore Mediation and the St. Michaels Police Department. SMPD Chief Jeffrey Oswald said the Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions recommend the adoption of a police mediation program.▪ The Commissioners agreed to put out a request for proposal for interior and exterior painting of the Environmental Concern building on Boundary Lane. Town Administrator Rob Straebel said proposals are due Nov. 28. He said the RFP will be advertised in the local newspaper and on the town's website.▪ The Commissioners voted unanimously to amend an ordinance to increase the number of Parks and Recreation Advisory Board members from five to seven. Marise Galgano, who is on the board, said they could use \"some more hands to get dirty.\" She said that the board has been working well with Public Works and thinks having more minds would be helpful.▪ The Commissioners did not vote on whether to approve design fees for jail and bathroom improvements at the Police Department. Timothy Crosby of Crosby and Associates shared his design proposal with the commissioners.Commissioner Tad DuPont raised his concerns with the cost of the design, saying that it seemed too high a price. He said he would like to get other estimates on the project before moving forward. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The second was about the need for a day shelter in Cambridge.Jennifer Gauthier, founder and executive director of Lead4Life, spoke about the services which the nonprofit offers and inquired about partnering with the city.\"Allow us to hire people who can go into the community,\" Gauthier said. \"Allow us to have that peer-to-peer model to be able to spend some of the resources that we have on these two initiatives in your community.\" Founded in 2008, Lead-4Life aims to lower the number of youth entering the juvenile justice system.According to its website, the nonprofit offers 10 different programs, including alternative placement programming, mentoring and individual and family therapy.At the Council meeting, Gauthier talked about two pilot programs, a gun diversion program and a returning citizens program, which it wants to offer in Cambridge.Gauthier said Lead4Life has the funding to provide these services in Cambridge and \"all the way down to the Lower Shore.\" \"We just want to hear any concerns that you have or any opportunity for us that you want to be able to partner (with us),\" she said.\"We're not asking you for money.\" After Gauthier spoke, Commissioner Sputty Cephas said that he thinks it would be great to partner with Lead4Life and try to expand the program in Cambridge.\"From everything that I've heard so far, we need you here,\" he said. \"Any way that we can continue to funnel this information and get the word out there about all that you guys are doing, I would love to.\" Valerie Nwakudo Davis, with Delmarva Community Services, spoke to the Council next about the need for a day shelter in Cambridge.\"This presentation is not for any agency,\" she said.\"It really is on behalf of our homeless population in this city, in this county.\" Davis said that there is a growing population of homeless people and talked about the importance of having a shelter for people to go to, particularly the aging homeless population.\"We cannot afford, as a community, to have people sitting on benches when it's 22 degrees outside, or when it's 92 degrees outside,\" she said.Davis said that although The Salvation Army provides shelter at night, those people in need of service don't have somewhere to go in the day. She said this problem is most apparent on the weekends.\"Sunday is the most miserable time of the week when you're homeless,\" she said, adding that places like the library and One Mission Cambridge are closed then.Delmarva Community Services hosted a meeting last week, Davis said. The Overflow Cafe, One Mission Cambridge and The Salvation Army were at the meeting.\"We talked about what was here already and what we need,\" she said.To get a day shelter in Cambridge, Davis said support from the local government is needed. She also said support from churches is needed.\"Because that could be an awesome volunteer segment of this,\" she said.After Davis spoke, Mayor Stephen Rideout said he had spoken with Davis about this a few weeks ago.\"I thought it was very important,\" he said. \"It was something that we have not really paid attention to enough. So we're having an ongoing series of meetings with the churches and citizens and agencies to see what we might be able to do here to address this particular issue.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nJennifer Gauthier, founder and executive director of Lead-4Life, speaks to the Cambridge City Council about a possible partnership during a Council meeting Nov. 13. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton considering changes to zoning, subdivisions\n\n November 17, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 3 | Section: News \n \n 760\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - The Easton Town Council is considering amendments and updates to two chapters of the town code concerning zoning and subdivisions.The two ordinances, which separately amend several aspects of the town's zoning code and update its existing subdivision code, were up for public hearings at the council's Monday, Nov. 6, meeting, where a number of town residents opposed some changes.Ordinance 803, which concerns changes to zoning code, drew a number of questions and prompted the council to continue its public hearing to the first meeting in January.The public hearing on Ordinance 804, which would update the town's subdivision code, will be continued at the council's Monday, Nov. 20, meeting.ORDINANCE 803: ZONINGThe town approved and adopted a comprehensive revision of its zoning code in December 2021, but after evaluation and monitoring of the code, the planning commission determined that certain amendments were appropriate to better guide and regulate development activities, according to the text of the ordinance.In response to the evaluation, the planning commission proposed 12 amendments to the zoning code, which were recommended for adoption in March. If passed, Ordinance 803 would enact the amendments.At the Nov. 6 meeting, Town Planner Lynn Thomas characterized a majority of the amendments as \"housekeeping.\" But she noted two more important aspects: changing the ways in which middle housing types are created and changing five of those subtypes from a special exception use to a permitted use in three Easton districts: R-7A, R-10A and central business.Lynn Mielke, a Talbot County Council member who spoke at the meeting only as a resident of the Easton Club neighborhood, raised concerns about the \"inadequate\" amount of time residents had to read through the 250-page agenda packet and research before attending the meeting to make a comment.Mielke also objected to a revision of the language detailing how quickly planned unit developments must begin construction after final approval and language extending the expiration dates of those projects.The proposed revision extends the length of time owners or developers have to begin construction on a project from two years to three years after final approval. If no action is taken within three years, the site's zoning will revert to its previous classification.Mielke pointed to the proposed Maryland Health Club project within the Easton Club neighborhood as an example, asserting that residents have been \"living in limbo and uncertainty\" about the development's status.Easton Club resident Pamela Reynolds voiced concern with several housing types currently classified as special exception uses being permitted by right in the R-10A district - a residential area.\"I find most of them charming names, but they can have a considerable impact on the density (of the) development,\" she said.Reynolds also questioned if the recently approved and scaled-back neighboring Poplar Hill development could increase its density under the amendment and if the Maryland Health Club's PUD application would be impacted.Speaking on behalf of the East-End Neighborhood Association, president Joseph Minarick expressed worries about trash removal the number of additional cars on the streets if middle housing structures were added in the neighborhood, The association recommended and requested that no change be made to the special exception requirements for all middle housing structures in the three districts in question.Kelly Pezor, who serves on the town's historic district commission, said she and other commissioners were concerned about preserving the area's historic nature and keeping new developments within guidelines.In an Oct. 30 letter to the town council and mayor, the planning commission expressed support for limiting special exceptions to address the town's need for more affordable and diverse housing types. Commissioners also supported revising the expiration of PUD approvals to three years.Council members also raised concerns and questions about the complexity of the proposed amendments.The public record will remain open until the council's first meeting in January.ORDINANCE 804: SUBDIVISIONSSpeaking on revisions to subdivisions within the town code, Thomas said there were not a \"tremendous\" number of proposed changes.To Thomas, the most significant changes include the elimination of a street hierarchy system, which was dictated by average daily trips; adding new nonresidential street types and standards for commercial and industrial roads; revised standards for residential street types, including street widths; and requiring that at least 50% of park space in a subdivision must be provided in the form of one centrally located neighborhood park.No public comments were shared at the Nov. 6 meeting, though council members voiced positive feedback for the revisions.The two ordinances and details of the proposed changes to the town code can be found on the Town of Easton's website under pending zoning legislation. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "No recommendations made on Boundary Lane Waterfront Park master plan - Town discusses potential dog park\n\n December 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 648\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS - Following a joint meeting Tuesday between the St. Michaels Planning Commission and the town's parks and recreation advisory board, no recommendations were made by either board on options for the proposed Boundary Lane Waterfront Park master plan.Though both boards declined to make formal recommendations on the master plan options to the town commissioners, the meeting furthered the discussion process on possibilities for the waterfront park project ahead of the commissioners' consideration of the options in January.Recommendations by the boards are not required for the commissioners to consider the master plan, but would be helpful in the process, according to Town Administrator Rob Straebel.Conversations on the master plan for the park have been ongoing for several months after the town purchased the 7.6-acre property on Boundary Lane adjacent to San Domingo Creek for $2.9 million earlier this year.The property, formerly owned by nonprofit Environmental Concern, includes an administrative building and several acres previously used for a nursery operation.About 4.6 acres of the property are within town limits and are designated as an intensely developed area within the critical area, but nearly three acres remain under the county's land zoning designation of resource conservation area.Several areas of concern outlined in the master plan's previous public outreach meetings and in public survey comments were clarified at Tuesday's meeting, including sea level rise, stormwater and a potential name for the park.According to Town Planner Steve Ball, the park's master plan does consider sea level rise and includes a berm to protect buildings from that impact in the future.In terms of stormwater, Ball said there wasn't much of a concern with the property currently, but the master plan does recommend removing much of the site's existing impervious surface.Expansion of the wetland area and maintaining the current living shoreline to filter stormwater will also be beneficial.However, a particularly significant point of contention with the park that remains to be considered is whether or not to include a dog park within the proposed waterfront park.In February, the town commissioners passed a resolution supporting a dog park location within the town, though no location was specified.The town's intent for the park is primarily open space, which opens up opportunities to receive state grant funding to offset the purchase price. However, the inclusion of a dog park within the property's future amenities would be inconsistent with the funding, Ball said.Other locations within the town have been identified as possibilities for a dog park, including a roughly twoacre piece of land adjacent to Bradley Park that's currently owned by the State Highway Administration.Scott Scarfone, an associate principal at Mahan Rykiel Associates, who's worked on the design for the Boundary Lane park project, said the project is trying to accommodate a variety of different park users.Ultimately, two park master plan options will be considered by the commissioners.Both options will include connectivity to the existing nature trail, loop trails, expanded wetlands, the living shoreline, a fishing pier, a pollinator meadow, reforestation, a viewing mound and a comfort station. One option will not include a dog park and will instead have an expanded pollinator meadow.Comments from residents at Tuesday's meeting primarily centered on the appropriateness of a dog park within the Boundary Lane property, though vehicular access to the park via Boundary Lane and West Chew Avenue and water quality concerns also came up.Several members of the planning commission said they were uncomfortable with making recommendations on the master plan due to a lack of information and research on the dog park, though there was acknowledgement of the town's preference for a passive park.The town commissioners will consider both options and the number of comments submitted by residents at the Wednesday, Jan. 10, meeting. \n \n Caption: Scott Scarfone, left, an associate principal at Mahan Rykiel Associates, speaks to members of the St. Michaels planning commission and parks and recreation advisory board about the proposed Boundary Lane Waterfront Park master plan. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Currently, SHA plans to develop preliminary improvement concepts this winter and present those concepts for feedback in the spring. It also plans to finalize its study recommendations and identify any potential stand-alone projects in the spring.Harris said the project is not funded for anything outside of the study.\"Not construction and things of that nature,\" she said. \"That could come down the line But right now, we're tasked to do this study and develop some concepts.\" Bruce Pepper, who lives on Mitchell Road, said he's most interested in seeing the concepts that the SHA comes up with.One of Pepper's main concerns is traffic. He said that he has noticed Legion Road getting beach traffic.\"They run 60 miles an hour down that road,\" he said. \"It's hilly, winding.And they think they're getting ahead, but they're not. But the GPS tells them it's a shortcut.\" Pepper's neighbors, Alyssa and Jamie Taylor, said they have concerns with safety and the accidents.\"We have only been here for about two and a half years,\" Alyssa Taylor said. \"And we have walked up to, I would say, at least three - I can think of four or five accidents that we hear happen.\" The Taylors are especially interested to find out if Route 404 will be expanding.\"I would love to know if 404 is going to be in my front yard,\" Alyssa Taylor said.If that does happen, the Taylors would consider moving. They said it would affect property values and be a safety concern.\"Even though my front door right now is probably 160 feet from the centerline - If they do dual-lane, I don't want tractor trailers, cars, motorcycles, whatever, going 80 miles an hour now 60 feet from my door, 80 feet from my door,\" Jamie Taylor said.Alyssa Taylor said she was happy that SHA wanted to hear from residents and said that they had written down \"everything that we're saying.\" John Booze said everyone from SHA was receptive and willing to listen.\"Tough forum too because everybody has their own issue,\" he said.\"I don't envy them. But they gave everybody a good listen and I think it'll be positive going forward.\" Booze said traffic volume and getting across Route 404 are some of his major concerns.\"Getting across the road,\" he said. \"Whether it's somebody coming from a home. Whether it's somebody coming from business The folks that have frontage right on 404 I really am concerned about.\" Like Pepper, Booze has noticed more drivers taking roads that connect to MD 404.\"Because of Waze and GPS and Google Maps, people are starting to go farther out on the back roads to get where they want to go,\" he said.Booze said those drivers are driving fast and its causing the traffic problems to spread outside of Route 404.\"So you need to take that into consideration as well,\" he said. \"That was one of the things that I wanted to make sure I shared with them when I came.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nRobin Tighe (in grey) shows PEL Study team member Seth Darlington (far left) her concerns on a map of state Route 404 on Dec. 6 at Denton Elementary School. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The agency is still accepting survey comments, which can be accessed via the SHA project page. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nEaston Town Council Ward 2 Councilman Don Abbatiello, center, speaks to a State Highway Administration representative about potential improvements to Matthewstown Road. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Commissioners Mull Moratorium On Poultry Byproduct Storage\n\n December 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; Cconnolly@Chespub.Com | Page: 13 | Section: News \n \n 914\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - Following a sometimes spirited discussion of a controversial poultry byproduct treatment system, the three Caroline County Commissioners went into closed session Tuesday, Dec. 12, with the county's attorney to refine language for a temporary moratorium.Crystal Dadds, director of the Caroline County Department of Planning and Codes opened the discussion that focused on a \"possible moratorium on the onsite storage of dissolved air flotation, otherwise known as DAF.\"\nDadds said the department and the commissioners had heard concerns from citizens about the recent construction of a concrete storage pit used to store DAF, or raw food waste.\n\"And there's some concern that the county does not have any specific regulations to address agricultural storage tanks,\" she said. At issue is the waste products being trucked into the county from poultry processing plants located elsewhere.\nConcerned citizens, an agricultural expert and a trade association spokesman weighed in during the nearly hourlong discussion.\nGrayson Middleton, government affairs manager with the Delmarva Chicken Association, argued that DAF is \"an agricultural product because it's coming from a product that's being manufactured agriculturally on the Shore, and it's being applied to the Shore in an agricultural manner.\"\n\"If there's no place to store this, it makes it extremely hard for application,\" Middleton said.\nHowever, Commissioner Frank Bartz claimed there was a distinction between a farmer being paid to store a product or being the end user of it.\nCommission Vice President Larry Porter was more blunt. \"We're not going to become a storage ground in this county for things brought in here from somewhere else and then everybody else is going to have to sit around and deal with it,\" he said.\nThe DAF pit is located on River Road outside Ridgely.\nNeighbors reported the stench and flies emanating from the open-pit DAF were unlike manure since the DAF contains poultry processing byproducts.\n\"The smell smacks you in the face,\" said John Hammer, a farmer and poultry producer who lives about a quarter-mile from the DAF facility.\nSue Ellen and Mike Woodward live on Marblehead Road, and their property borders the land on which the facility sits.\nMike Woodward said the smell is so sickening, he can't work at his sawmill outside, and the flies are \"just outrageous. I mean, they just cling right to our house.\"\nCommission President Travis Breeding cited another concern. Hauling the materials in 18-wheelers and tanker trucks \"is increasing the weight in traffic and potential damage to roads that, frankly, we struggle to keep up with now,\" he said.\nBartz placed the responsibility for storing byproducts on the poultry plants.\n\"It's up to them to expand their holding facilities and processing facilities where they are, instead of sending it to wherever they can just find a room and just to stick it temporarily,\" he said.\nCaroline County Extension agent Jim Lewis said DAF is part of the nutrient management program and regulated by the Maryland Department of Agriculture, but \"they very rarely issue fines\" for violations.\nThe Maryland Department of the Environment deals with biosolids and can \"pull their permits, they can fine them, shut them down,\" Lewis said.\nHowever, at this point DAF is not considered a biosolid, but rather a \"soil amendment\" which should be worked into the soil within a day, Lewis said.\n\"If you do incorporation, then you're exposing soil to the surface rather than leaving a cover crop with no till,\" he said. DAF is untreated, Lewis said. \"It's a decomposing meat, fat, blood product that potentially, I would think, would carry foodborne diseases.\nThe residents who commented said the DAF pit in their vicinity is not the only one in the county. The commissioners and planning department have heard of other storage facilities.\nPorter asked Middleton if Caroline County had any poultry processing plants.\nMiddleton said no and added that the county has chicken houses.\n\"I'm fully aware that we have chicken houses,\" Porter said. \"Are the chicken houses bringing material to these pits directly?\" \"This is the kind of thing that irritates me to no end,\" Porter said. \"We're not going to subject our citizens to this.\"\nCounty Attorney Stewart Barroll told the citizens who complained about the DAF pit, \"What you've described to us is clearly a nuisance and not protected by the Right to Farm law.\" He asked if they had sought legal counsel. They answered that they couldn't afford an attorney and were afraid of retaliation.\n\"I don't know if I can handle that fight, let alone the expense of going through a long, drawn-out process of me trying to prove what the stink is like in the air, or how many flies are around my window or what's in my ditch,\" Sue Ellen Woodward said. \"I don't have the resources or the emotional part to fight that. That's why I come to you.\"\n\"I think we're going to attempt to address the issue for you and try to come up with reasonable expectations and guidelines for the storage and application of this product,\" Breeding said.\nThe commissioners went into closed session with Barroll to determine the language to place in a resolution to declare a temporary moratorium.\nThey plan to introduce a resolution at their Dec. 20 meeting. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n This facility near Ridgely was the subject of discussion by neighbors' objecting to the smell emanating from its concrete DA F pit.\n\n CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Crystal Dadds, director of the Caroline County Department of Planning and Codes, foreground, and Caroline County Extension agent Jim Lewis share their views Dec. 12 about a possible moratorium on the onsite storage of dissolved air flotation, otherwise known as DA F. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The council unanimously passed legislation approving gas and electric rate revisions proposed by Easton Utilities.Armed with the approval, Easton Utilities will file formal rate increase requests with the Maryland Public Service Commission. The PSC will hold a public hearing on the proposed rates next year and make a final determination.\nFurther discussion on an ordinance amending the town code as it relates to bicycles will be postponed until the council's Jan. 2 meeting. Discussions remain as to if residents should be allowed to ride bicycles on the sidewalk.\nA workshop on Ordinance 803, which proposes a number of amendments to the town's zoning code, will be held in mid-January. At the council's Jan. 2 meeting, the legislation will be continued to a future meeting, and will tentatively be heard in February, according to Easton Town Council President Frank Gunsallus.\nDuring the public comment portion of the meeting, Landon Frase, a local Boy Scout, raised concerns about the safety of students crossing Peach blossom Road by Easton Middle School when a crossing guard is not present. He suggested adding blinking lights for students and other pedestrians to push when crossing the street. The town will contact the State Highway Administration to see if changes can be made. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Van Emburgh said that although he was a little bit skeptical of the idea at first, the project turned out great.\n\"Projects like this make working for the Town of Easton so rewarding,\" he said before the ribbon was cut. \"We felt the excitement from the community and can't wait to cut the ribbon and officially open the skate park and pump track.\" Easton Mayor Megan Cook thanked the town's Engineering, Parks and Recreation and Public Works departments.\n\"They took the creative vision and really built it,\" she said about Public Works.\nTown Manager Don Richardson said this project was one of multiple funded by a $7 million bond from 2020 to improve Parks and Recreation facilities. He said that before the new skate park and pump track, there were one or two small skate ramps at North Easton Park that weren't being used at a high rate.\n\"But certainly this has been a major investment and a major project for the Town of Easton,\" he said.\n\"I hope that you all enjoy it and do it safely and often.\" Jacob Bowie said that he comes to North Easton Park to skateboard all the time. This new skate park is \"exactly what we needed,\" he said.\n\"It's got a little bit of everything for everybody,\" he said. \"It's just perfect.\" Bowie said he plans to come out to the park to skate once a week \"maybe every day once it's summertime.\" Van Emburgh called the schedule to complete this project \"extremely aggressive\" but said that the town worked hard to make it happen. Spohn Ranch, the general contractor for the project, worked with Easton Public Works to prepare the site before construction.\nPublic Works constructed the drainage in the middle of the pump track, put in the concrete between the pump track and skate park, put in benches and picnic tables, did some of the landscaping, re-striped the parking areas and installed signage.\nRichardson said that these Parks and Recreation facilities projects are something that residents will be able to see throughout the town.\n\"Things like dog parks and woodland parks and other improvements to many of our parks and recreation facilities are coming soon,\" he said. \"So please keep your eyes and ears attuned to those things happening here.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Skate boarders line up at the top of a ramp at Easton's new skate park at North Easton Park on Dec. 28.\n\n MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Joey Genco skates at Easton's new skate park at North Easton Park on Dec. 28 following a ribbon cutting.\n\n MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n From left, Easton Town Manager Don Richardson, Easton Ward 3 Council member David Montgomery, Easton Ward 4 Council member the Rev.

    "content": "St. Michaels Commissioners choose Boundary Lane park master plan\n\n January 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 711\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — With time ticking to submit a grant application to the state, the Commissioners of St. Michaels concluded a nearly three-hour meeting Wednesday with a vote to move forward with a master plan for a new park on Boundary Lane.The master plan for the park that town staff recommend be named San Domingo Creek Park — as the 7.6-acre property is adjacent to the creek — includes nature trails, expanded wetlands, a living shoreline, a fishing pier, a comfort station and a pollinator meadow.\nThe property was purchased by the town in September for $2.9 million. Formerly owned by nonprofit Environmental Concern, the property has an existing administrative building, which the town plans to use for a new town office.\nAt the meeting, Town Planner Steve Ball told commissioners that the town intends to submit a grant application to the state for Program Open Space funds in order to offset the cost of the park.\nWith the grant application due Feb. 10, he said the commissioners would need to decide if any changes need to be made to the master plan at the Jan. 11 meeting so the plan can be brought back for final adoption at the Jan. 24 meeting and then submitted to the state.\nAfter Ball spoke, Scott Scarfone, an associate principal at Mahan Rykiel Associates, gave a presentation on two master plan options.\nFollowing the presentation, commissioners discussed aspects of both plans and whether certain parts should be included. They considered the possibilities of including a dog park and a viewing mound as well as different parking options.\nCommissioner Tad DuPont said the town has spent a large chunk of its savings to purchase the land and that the town should maximize the amount of open space in the plan to get as much grant money as possible.\n\"It's my feeling that the town has this one shot to maximize as much open space, unencumbered as possible, to be able to be able to get the most money we can from Program Open Space to cover our costs,\" he said, causing residents at the meeting to applaud.\nProgram Open Space is a state program under the Department of Natural Resources that administers funding for open and recreational space in local communities.\nDuPont said he didn't think the dog park was appropriate on the land and didn't like the viewing mound — a 10-foot hill with an ADA-accessible path that visitors could walk up to get a view of the creek from above.\nThe inclusion of a dog park has been a point of contention when it comes to proposed plans for the park.\nIn February, town commissioners passed a resolution supporting a dog park location within the town, though no location was specified.\nAt a joint meeting in December between the St. Michaels Planning Commission and the town's Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, Ball said the inclusion of a dog park would not be consistent with the open space funding program.\nDuPont also voiced his concerns with the plans for a parking lot off Boundary Lane. He said that 12 parking spaces outside the town office building would be enough — eight spots for employees, two spots for visitors and two handicap spots.\nDuring public comment, resident Langley Shook said if there is no dog park on the property, there is no need for more parking. He said adding more parking could affect how much funding the town gets from the state.\n\"All the parking would do would be to draw people who would have to drive at a distance,\" he said. \"Which I think you generally don't want.\"\nShook made a suggestion to not include the additional parking lot to the plan, and if there is a need for more parking down the line, it can be added to the park later on.\nCommission President David Breimhurst said not everyone who uses the park is going to be able-bodied.\n\"We'll have senior citizens and others who are not going to enjoy (the walk to get to the park),\" he said. \"They're going to want to be able to park, maybe walk to one of the pavilions and sit and enjoy the view.\"\nUltimately, the commissioners voted to not include the dog park or viewing mound in the master plan.\nThe master plan they voted on does include the parking lot off Boundary Lane. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The bill is set to expire on Jan. 18.\nTuesday's meeting was canceled due to the heavy rain and strong winds that moved across the area that night.\nThe bill, introduced in November, was spurred by a request from residents who hope to open a liquor store in Trappe.\nThe county's current code has certain restrictions on the issuance of off-sale licenses, or licenses that allow the sale of alcohol for off-premises consumption.\nEvery municipality in Talbot County, except for Trappe, has an off-sale license holder.\nOpening a liquor store would require a Class E license. Currently, new Class E establishments are prohibited from being issued a license or opening within the town due to it not meeting the population requirement of 750 residents.\nAn amendment to Resolution 348 is also set for introduction at the special meeting.\nThe legislation addresses incorrect water and sewer classifications of parcels shown in two exhibits to Resolution 281, legislation that approved a wastewater treatment plant for the Lakeside at Trappe development under a draft discharge permit.\nThe amendment is set for consideration by the Public Works Advisory Board on Jan. 18.\nThe board and the county planning commission have been reviewing Resolution 348 and a second piece of legislation relating to Lakeside for several months. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Weather conditions caused the school system to close for the entire day.\nDorchester County Public Schools also closed for the day due to icy road conditions. Caroline County Public Schools closed for students, but offices opened at 10 a.m. for its 12-month employees.\nEaston's Superintendent of Public Works Mike Dickerson said Easton Public Works used 46.92 tons of salt to keep the town's roadways safe. He said the department applied salt to the town's main roads — roads like Washington Street that get you into town — three times.\nAfter receiving a notification from the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services, Easton Public Works began salting roads at 4 p.m. Monday. Dickerson said the last of the department's five trucks finished salting for the third time at 4:44 a.m. on Tuesday.\n\"We had five trucks out,\" he said. \"And each one of them has an assigned route.\"\nAccording to the National Weather Service, winter weather advisories for Queen Anne's, Talbot and Caroline counties were issued early Tuesday morning and in effect until 1 p.m. on Tuesday.\nThe advisories were for mixed precipitation with additional snow of up to an inch and ice accumulation of around one 10th of an inch. The advisories stated that morning commutes could be affected due to slippery road conditions.\nDorchester County received a winter weather advisory from the National Weather Service for freezing rain and additional ice accumulation. The advisory was in effect until 11 a.m. Tuesday morning.\nAs of noon on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service, snow and freezing rain were likely in Easton before 1 p.m. with a chance of rain and snow between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. and a chance of more snow after 2 p.m. Little or no snow accumulation is expected. A tenth of an inch of ice accumulation is possible.\nDickerson said Easton Public Works has its trucks prepared in the event that employees have to go back out to take care of the roads. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tense discussion precedes Easton Town Council approval for Pride festival\n\n January 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Local News \n \n 1010\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A request to approve a public assembly permit for the Delmarva Pride Center's annual Pride festival, though approved in a 3-2 vote, elicited strong concerns from some Easton Town Council members.Though the Delmarva Pride Festival is heading into its third year in Easton, one council member's uneasiness with the contents of the festival stirred up a multi-pronged discussion on Town Council precedents and the council's responsibilities and scope in reviewing events meant to benefit the community good.\nThis year's Delmarva Pride Festival is set for Saturday, June 15, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. It's planned as a celebration of the Delmarva LGBTQ+ community and its allies during Pride Month.\nThe previous two Pride festivals held in Easton featured a variety of food trucks, live music, local vendors and performances. Residents and pets alike donned rainbow clothing and accessories as they celebrated in the heart of downtown Easton.\nFestival organizers expect about 2,000 people to attend the 2024 festival.\nCOUNCIL CONTENTIONS\nAfter the introduction of the festival's public assembly permit at Tuesday's town council meeting, Ward 3 Council Member David Montgomery raised a flag about the festival's activities in previous years.\nHe cited a video he'd seen that reportedly showed \"overtly sexualized performances and behavior\" and voiced concern about harm to children exposed to those displays.\n\"For these reasons, I don't believe this event as it was constituted in the past serves the common good of our town,\" Montgomery said.\nThe Ward 3 council member said he wanted to see what could be done to find a \"more appropriate\" location and about festival organizers' efforts to prevent similar behavior, adding that the displays were \"not ones that many people want to see in this town.\"\nMontgomery suggested postponing Delmarva Pride Center's application to a later meeting for a more thorough discussion.\nTown Council President Frank Gunsallus said the council should extend the privilege of waiting to Montgomery, citing the council's precedent of tabling discussions based on members seeking more information or a deeper understanding prior to voting.\nWard 4 council member the Rev. Elmer Davis Jr. disagreed, calling it \"quite unfair\" to change the Pride festival's location or timing.\n\"I respect my colleagues, but I don't respect their opinion on this issue and this concern,\" he said. \"I think the date and time is here and available to us, and I think we should vote on it.\"\nDavis honed in on Montgomery's mention of young children in the context of the event, pointing out that parents had brought them to the festival.\n\"We are not in a position to be parental guidance for anyone; that's the parents' responsibility. We don't have oversight,\" he said, eliciting some claps from residents in the gallery.\nMontgomery countered, saying he thought the council did have a responsibility to look at the content of festivals proposed to occur in the town. He re-emphasized his concerns about opening the festival up to minors and potentially harmful content.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook pointed out the festival's success over the last two years and a lack of complaints.\n\"The only complaint I ever heard was that it was such a lovely event, and it's shared with Juneteenth — he wished it was actually extended into two weekends,\" she said before Gunsallus began speaking over her.\n\"We've had an outpouring of people raising concerns in the past week,\" he said.\n\"We've also had an outpouring of support on this,\" Cook said, being echoed by Ward 1 Council Member Maureen Curry.\n\"You're right, and that's fine,\" Gunsallus said. \"But we also have to serve everyone that has voted and put us in this position as a broader community.\"\nMontgomery's motion to table approving the festival's permit was put to a vote, with Gunsallus seconding it. But before a roll call could be taken, Ward 2 council member Don Abbatiello chimed in.\n\"While I wholeheartedly disagree with waiting, and I have every intention, when we do vote on this, to vote in favor of allowing the public assembly permit to go through — if there is a member of this council who would like to wait, even if I disagree with it ... then we should wait,\" he said.\nThough Abbatiello supported waiting because of the precedent set by the council before, he emphasized strongly that he would be voting in favor of the assembly permit as soon as possible.\nCurry and Davis also emphasized their intentions to support the permit's approval, but they said they would honor Montgomery's request to wait.\nVIDEO\nA video of a performer from a previous festival was shown at the meeting, though it was not the same video that put Montgomery on edge. That video reportedly involved children coming up to a dancer, watching the dancer's crotch and handing money to them, he said later.\nTina Jones, a co-founder and treasurer of Delmarva Pride Center, approached the podium to try to allay the concerns voiced by some council members, tackling the questions sparked by the video.\n\"These are dancers, these are performers — if you decided they're something else, that's the decision you're making, but these are professionals,\" she said. \"They are no different than a ballet dancer or somebody in a musical, and I bet you would have no problem letting a child come up with them and present flowers.\"\nNo one was \"scantily clothed\" either, Jones said.\nMontgomery said he only asked for assurances that there would be no exhibitions like the ones reportedly in the video he referred to.\n\"We are not trying to groom anybody, we are not trying to change anybody's mind about who they are or what they want to be,\" Jones said. \"We're just trying to say to folks who feel different, who feel like they don't have a place, that they do have a place, and I would love for that place to be the place where I grew up.\"\nMontgomery later conceded to the council moving to vote, saying he doubted the council would hear anything different.\nCurry initiated the motion to approve the assembly permit for the Pride festival, which was supported with resounding \"ayes\" from Abbatiello and Davis.\nMontgomery and Gunsallus voted against approving the permit for the Pride festival, resulting in a 3-2 approval. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A lifetime of accomplishments in Easton\n\n January 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editorials \n \n 806\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last weekend, hundreds of friends gathered to wish former Easton Mayor Bob Willey a happy retirement.It was a forced retirement. Willey lost two elections last year, first in the mayoral race in May and then in the race for Town Council president in September.\nThose elections ended 32 years in elected office in the town, first as a councilman on the Town Council for six years, followed by six years as Town Council president and then a 20-year run as mayor.\nBut those electoral losses should not overshadow a lifetime of accomplishments.\nHis list of accomplishments during those 32 years is long, just as the list of dignitaries gathered to honor him Jan. 13 was long — a proclamation from the Talbot County Council, a proclamation and shadowbox from the Town of Easton, a framed plaque of recognition from Easton Utilities and citations from state Del. Chris Adams and state Sen. Johnny Mautz.\n\"It's heartening to see Mayor Willey get recognition for all he's done for our town and region,\" Mayor Megan Cook said. \"Knowing him and many of the dignitaries that have come to present, it's easy to see the positive impact and impression he's made to each of them, from the local fire department to the Senate floor.\"\nThere were honors recognizing a lifetime of devotion to Easton.\nThose walking the Rails to Trails will soon see a plaque on a boulder honoring Willey for his leadership in building the well-used trail system throughout the town. A concept for the monument was shown at the retirement reception.\nEaston Volunteer Fire Department dedicated its new fire engine, Engine 63, to Willey, including a plaque affixed to the side of the engine. That honor recognized 60 years of service with the volunteer fire department.\nWilley joined the fire department two years after marrying Betsy Lee Thompson from Oxford on Sept. 2, 1961. The couple raised three children in Easton. That family now includes four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\nWilley was employed by Waverly Press for 41 years until retiring in March 2002.\nBob Willey was not one to boast of his accomplishments — and there were many over the years. Typical were his comments at the opening of another branch of the Rails to Trails in April last year.\n\"Our teams have been consistently making improvements to the beauty of the trail, while also making it more usable and safe,\" Willey said at the ribbon-cutting. \"It will be nice to show off some of that hard work and to share it with the community.\"\nEvery day hundreds walk, run and bike along the trails through the city, which were developed under his leadership.\nPerhaps it is not the trails that are his greatest accomplishment over those many years in public office. One of his lasting legacies is the unseen strong financial position of the Town of Easton.\nThat was not the case when Willey first became mayor in 2003.\nEaston's economy was in shambles when Willey first became mayor. The town was deeply in debt. Under his fiscally conservative leadership, that dire situation turned around. Easton has not had a tax increase since 2007.\nAfter a lifetime of accomplishments in Easton, Willey was visibly moved by the outpouring of love and support at the Jan. 13 reception.\n\"It means a lot,\" he said. \"It's more than I ever could've hoped for. I'm really glad to see everyone out here enjoying themselves and having a good time. ... It really was a surprise.\"\nThere is more to do. Willey left office with some unfinished business. Others will need to pick up the mantle and complete these projects.\nAffordable housing continues to be a difficult problem. In 2007, the then mayor created the Affordable Housing Commission and a low-cost home repair loan program which met with some success.\n\"We need to achieve more,\" he said last year.\nAnd there is the new Easton hospital, which moved closer to becoming a reality last week with the state's approval of the certificate of need and the governor including $100 million in his budget proposal to make the plans happen.\nYet when the new hospital is built, the current buildings will be vacant. We like one of Willey's ideas to turn that property into a Veterans Administration facility to serve the many veterans on the Eastern Shore.\nIt's a great idea. It will be up to the next generation of town leaders to turn that idea — or another idea — into a workable plan.\nThey would be wise to look to Bob Willey's leadership over the past decades for examples of how to make that happen.\nHis philosophy was hidden in a comment he made at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Rails to Trails segment.\n\"This is just another step forward,\" Willey said referring to the added trail. \"It's going to get better.\"\nThat is a philosophy for success in leading a town — keep taking steps forward and believe that it's going to get better. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Arthur Ellis (D-Charles) introduced a bill on the first day of the General Assembly that would create something that Maryland has never had before — a state fruit.Native to Maryland, persimmons can be found just about everywhere in the state, with the exception of Garrett County due to the mountainous nature of the region.\nIn May and June, persimmon trees flower, but the fruit isn't ready until the fall, leading to many seasonal recipes and drinks. Persimmons have especially been used for fine wines, jams and baked goods.\nThe trees are known for their resilience, being able to thrive for years when they are below the canopy of a forest.\nPrices for persimmons have gone up significantly in recent years, reaching about $6 per pound, and many have not heard how easy it may be to source their own, according to Ellis.\n\"I have persimmon trees in my yard,\" Ellis said. \"They grow naturally, and they're beautiful and delicious.\"\nEllis introduced the legislation to raise awareness for the fruit, as many Marylanders do not realize it is a part of their state and its history.\nIndigenous people of the region used the fruit not only for food but medicinally as well. Sore throats and indigestion were common ailments that the use of persimmons attempted to treat.\nThroughout the Civil War, persimmon seeds were used as a coffee substitute when trade routes were impacted.\nThe usefulness of the persimmon tree doesn't end with the fruit. The wood of the tree is extremely strong, and is commonly used within shoes, golf clubs, flooring and musical instruments.\nIf Senate Bill 74 makes it through both state legislative houses and is signed by the governor, it would become effective Oct. 1.\nTwitter: @MattSoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They came with laptops from as far as Frederick and St. Mary's counties to be ready for this year's primary election on May 14.This exacting and meticulous training is what the nonprofit the League of Women Voters is all about. They hold the power to vote as sacred and nonpartisan information about that vote to be integral.\n\"The goal is to provide training for the people that are going to be doing the voters guide and inputting information in the Vote 411 website,\" said the president of the Queen Anne's County League of Women Voters, Elizabeth Hammond.\n\"This is it for in-person training. There will be an online training on Saturday, Jan. 20. I think it is a good idea to do both of them,\" Hammond said.\nShe said the organization gets donations to do this work and create the voters guide both online and in print.\n\"We insert it in the Record Observer and then order about 500 extra copies and distribute them to towns and post offices and various other public places to pick up and get information to make intelligent decisions about what they want to vote for,\" Hammond said.\nShe is clear about the big picture of voting rights.\n\"Voting is one of the freedoms that we absolutely cherish. You want to be able to make a responsible decision and vote for the candidate that you think can do the best job. That is what we try to do with the voter's guide — to give the voters the best information possible in a nonpartisan way,\" Hammond said.\nShe said this primary election will be smaller than the general election, which will have a more involved voter's guide.\nThe state Board of Elections is the ultimate authority for the League of Women Voters.\n\"It amazing what the state Board does. What the election boards do is amazing, and they really deserve all the support we can give them and their thanks. That's why you watch the candidate listings on the state board, because that is what is going to show up, and then the proof comes when they send out the individual ballots for each county. The hard thing is you have to look through each one of those ballots. It is like 200 pages long,\" said Jeanne Halpin of the League of Women Voters of Maryland.\nShe led the training that took place at the Queen Anne's County Public Library in Centreville.\nShe tried to be less daunting to all the volunteers that showed up across the state.\n\"This is just a great learning opportunity. Don't get stressed, don't go crazy. The political parties are nominating candidates. They are asking people to run. In both the primary and the general,\" Halpin said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Second amendment introduced for Lakeside unit resolution\n\n January 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Environment \n \n 764\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A second amendment to previously introduced legislation relating to the number of equivalent dwelling units in each phase of development at Lakeside at Trappe was introduced Tuesday by two Talbot County Council members.The amendment, requested by council Vice President Pete Lesher and introduced by him and council member Lynn Mielke, would modify the still-pending Resolution 347 to incorporate provisions of separate, but related, Lakeside legislation — Resolution 338 and its amendment — into its language.\nThe original version of Resolution 347, first introduced last September, would amend the county's comprehensive plan to include the number of equivalent dwelling units for each phase of development at Lakeside, though the numbers for Phases 2 through 6 are estimated.\nIt also provides the current water and sewer classifications for each phase. A total of 2,874 equivalent dwelling units are planned at Lakeside.\nThe language to be incorporated from Resolution 338 proposes amending the county's comprehensive water and sewer plan to be consistent with the Maryland Department of the Environment's discharge permit for Lakeside's wastewater treatment plant.\nThe permit, issued in October 2022, is limited to the project's first phase and allows for an annual average flow of 100,000 gallons per day, or roughly 250 gallons per day per equivalent dwelling unit, only allowing for roughly 400 residential units to be built.\nA major permit modification approved by the Maryland Department of the Environment is required for any future expansion of the wastewater treatment plant.\nResolution 338's provisions also would mandate any future expansion of the new plant to require a comprehensive water and sewer plan amendment.\nThe resolution's amendment, introduced in November, adds language requiring a certification from the Talbot County Planning Commission of the amendment's consistency with the county's comprehensive plan.\nAt Tuesday's council meeting, Lesher emphasized that none of the language proposed to be added to Resolution 347 via its second amendment is new. It's a different way to help the county's Planning Commission come to a finding of consistency, he said.\nResolution 347, though considered in a multi-hour Planning Commission meeting last October, has yet to receive any final determination of consistency, which is required when amending the county's comprehensive water and sewer plan.\nMultiple postponements of discussion on the legislation have lengthened the process, though the amended language of Resolution 338 was found consistent by the Planning Commission in December.\n\"This simply gives an alternative for the Planning Commission to say, 'Yes, with this language, if you combine it, we can find this consistent,'\" Lesher said. \"They may find Resolution 347 consistent without this amendment, they may find it consistent both without and with this amendment. If we get those alternatives, we then have that option to act at the council level.\"\nThe need for Resolution 347 stems from a request from the Maryland Department of the Environment last spring.\nThe agency asked the county to submit updated phase information and figures for water and sewer services with corrected classifications for all parcels within Trappe, including Lakeside, in a comprehensive water and sewer plan amendment.\nRelated legislation, Resolution 348, addresses the incorrect water and sewer classifications of parcels shown in two exhibits to Resolution 281, the original legislation approving a wastewater treatment plant for Lakeside under a draft discharge permit.\n\"Without that finding of consistency though, this resolution doesn't reach our desk,\" Lesher added, \"and we don't have that way of bringing closure to the outstanding issues from MDE that will allow us to finish that Report of the Review.\"\nCouncil Member Keasha Haythe questioned the need to add language from Resolution 338 into Resolution 347, saying the addition seemed to be the opposite of what the Maryland Department of the Environment requested.\nThe Town of Trappe is not on the same page as the county regarding the resolutions, she pointed out. Later, Haythe confirmed that the initial resolutions proposed were in line with what the agency wanted from the county.\nThe county's Planning Commission and the Public Works Advisory Board are set to discuss the two pending resolutions and amendments in a joint meeting on Wednesday, Feb. 7, at 11 a.m.\nA public hearing on all three Lakeside resolutions and amendments will be held at 6:30 p.m. at the Tuesday, Feb. 13, County Council meeting.\nFollowing Tuesday's meeting, council President Chuck Callahan issued a statement on the pending legislation.\n\"We understand that the resolutions regarding the county's comprehensive water and sewer plan and the Town of Trappe can be difficult to follow. It is a complicated matter with a lengthy history,\" he said in the statement. \"The council looks forward to addressing this matter on Feb. 13, 2024, and resolving the concerns raised by the Maryland Department of the Environment.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The power outage depleted water in the system and left air in the lines.\nMayor Kim Abner said an alert system did not go off Friday night when one of the town's water pumps failed to work. She said currently all three pumps are working and that they are pumping 600,000 gallons to fill the system. She said Department of Emergency Services was distributing water to people.\nAbner said Monday morning that she expects the water to be back soon. Abner said an investigation will be undertaken to figure out why this happened so it can be avoided in the future.\nShe said the town staff and council members have been pitching in to help people get water.\nThe latest Facebook post reported progress at 9:30 a.m. Monday.\n\"Staff will be delivering meals. Meals will be at fire department. All three wells are back online and pressure is coming up,\" the post read. \"We are now pumping 500 gallons a minute, but we need to fill the water towers and lines that were empty. It will take time, but we are making progress.\"\nBottled water for pick up is available at Federalsburg Volunteer Fire Department Company at noon.\nAbner is telling people not to turn on their faucets yet to allow pressure to build up in the pipes.\nA Facebook statement from the mayor, council and staff said, \"Water conditions have not improved like they should have. We have called in a well specialist for assistance. In the meantime, we are working on sourcing drinking water for our residents. Once we have a distribution location, we will let you know. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your understanding. Staff worked tirelessly yesterday (Sunday) to try to restore services and truly thought time would have allowed the lines to fill and restore pressure.\"\nAbner said some people have been calm and some have been agitated on Facebook, but that solutions are in progress. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to Hengst's letter, all of CWDI's meetings for 2024 will have an open session that the public can attend.\nIn the January letter, Hengst shared the results of the board's January 2024 officer election and gave updates on the project's progress.\nShe said board officers were elected at the board's annual organizing meeting. Hengst was elected president of the board, Shay Lewis-Sisco was elected vice president of the board and Frank Narr was elected secretary and treasurer of the board.\nDion Banks, Rich Zeidman and Mike Frenz are CWDI's other board members. Currently there is one vacant seat on the board that needs to be filled via an appointment made by the Dorchester County Council.\nHengst said board members serve on different committees including a Planning Committee, a Finance Committee, a Communication and Outreach Committee, a Government Relations Committee and a Hotel Development Committee.\nWhen it comes to the project's progress, Hengst said CWDI is currently negotiating a $30 million deal with a boutique hotel developer.

MICHAELS — The Town of St. Michaels Planning Commission has found that plans for San Domingo Creek Park are consistent with the town's comprehensive plan.At a meeting Thursday, the Planning Commission voted unanimously on this.\nThe 7.6 acre property at 201 Boundary Lane was purchased for $2.9 million by the town last year.\nThe town plans to use the existing building on the property for a new town office. The remainder of the property will be a public park, complete with nature trails, expanded wetlands, a living shoreline, a fishing pier, a comfort station and associated parking.\nIn late January, the Commissioners of St. Michaels voted to approve a final master plan for the park, as well as a $1.7 million open space grant application to help fund the project.\nWith the Planning Commission's vote Thursday, the Board of Zoning Appeals will now be able to vote on a request made by the Commissioners of St. Michaels to allow town administration offices and parks and recreation facilities on the property as a special exception.\nAt the meeting, Town Planner Steve Ball said that in order for this request to go to the Board of Zoning Appeals, the Planning Commission needed to determine that the proposed plans for the property are consistent with the town's comprehensive plan.\nBall gave a brief overview of his findings in reviewing the town's current comprehensive pan.\nHe said that although there is nothing in the comprehensive plan that specifically addresses the Boundary Lane site — as the project wasn't anticipated when the comprehensive plan was last updated — there were four chapters within the comprehensive plan that he believes prove the project is consistent with the comprehensive plan.\nSpecifically, Ball pointed to the chapters on municipal growth, environmental resources, climate resistance and parks and recreation.\nHe said the project is consistent with municipal growth because a part of the property will be annexed into the town.\nWhen it comes to environmental resources in the town, Ball said the park will provide buffers, create stormwater filtration and protect and enhance wetland areas. For climate resistance, he said the park will have a living shoreline to help with sea level rise.\nWith parks and recreation, Ball said the master plan for the park will give residents the opportunity to enjoy the natural environment. He said the park will enhance the existing town park facilities.\n\"It also allows for the town's trail system to be expanded for the community,\" he said.\nAfter Ball presented his findings, Planning Commission Chair Christopher Thomas said he wanted to make it clear that the Planning Commission wasn't voting on the specifics of the master plan, but on whether the project plans, overall, are consistent with the town's comprehensive plan.\n\"I think that's important to note,\" he said.\nBefore making the motion to acknowledge the project plans are consistent with the comprehensive plan, Planning Commission Vice Chair John Novak said he didn't see any contradictions, adding that the project makes economic sense for the town too.\n\"Using an existing building instead of building an entire new town office for $2 million plus, I think it makes economic sense,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said the park will enhance the existing town park facilities.\n\"It also allows for the town's trail system to be expanded for the community,\" he said.\nAfter Ball presented his findings, Planning Commission Chair Christopher Thomas said he wanted to make it clear that the Planning Commission wasn't voting on the specifics of the master plan, but on whether the project plans, overall, are consistent with the town's comprehensive plan.\n\"I think that's important to note,\" he said.\nBefore making the motion to acknowledge the project plans are consistent with the comprehensive plan, Planning Commission Vice Chair John Novak said he didn't see any contradictions, adding that the project makes economic sense for the town too.\n\"Using an existing building instead of building an entire new town office for $2 million plus, I think it makes economic sense,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A renewed call for openness in government\n\n February 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editorials \n \n 765\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Open Meetings Compliance Board this week ruled the state law requiring government bodies to conduct business in public did not apply to a Nov. 13 meeting of the Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc.'s Nov. 13 meeting which included all members of the Dorchester County Council and a non-quorum of the Cambridge City Council.The Star Democrat and WHCP, the NPR partner in Cambridge, filed a complaint alleging that the meeting — or most of it — should have been open to the public. The board ruled that the development corporation is not a public body and the meeting was not a \"meeting\" of the County Council.\n\"Thus, the Act's requirements did not apply,\" the ruling stated.\nThe meeting was convened by the Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. board to discuss issues related to developing the prime acreage along the Choptank River at the entrance to the city. The project envisions public spaces like a promenade and parks, a boutique hotel that has a restaurant and bar, and residential and mixed-use spaces along the river.\nThe Nov. 13 meeting included all members of the County Council. A quorum of the City Council was present, but one of the members left so those remaining would be in compliance with the state open meeting laws. The council members present had voted that they believed the meeting was in violation of the open meeting law.\nCWDI, a nonprofit that was formed by the city of Cambridge, Dorchester County and the state of Maryland, has been tasked with planning and developing space along the Cambridge waterfront, known as Cambridge Harbor. Plans include public spaces like a promenade and parks, a boutique hotel and residential and mixed-use spaces along the Choptank River.\nCWDI Executive Director Matt Leonard said that during the meeting, CWDI talked about business deals it is working on.\nDorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said he was glad to see the decision that was made.\n\"There was never an intention for the Dorchester County Council to be violating any confidence of trust,\" he said.\nYet the County Council did violate the public's confidence, and the Open Meetings Compliance Board noted so in its conclusion, saying: \"Although the Act did not apply to this discussion, the appearance that business was being conducted secretly did not serve the purpose of the Act 'to increase the faith of the public in government.'\"\nThe ruling added: \"Our conclusion in no way condones the action of a quorum of the [Councilmembers] in creating what was, at the least, an appearance of impropriety.\"\nThat appearance of impropriety is harmful to a project that is much needed in Cambridge. The successful — and financially sound — development of the 35-acre parcel is critical to the city's future.\nSome good things have already followed the filing of the complaint. We have seen more openness from the development corporation. The group has begun publishing monthly letters detailing what the CWDI board is working on with Cambridge Harbor.\n\"We plan to keep the public informed on our progress and what you can look forward to in the coming months/year,\" said the Jan. 29 letter, signed by CWDI President Angie Hengst.\nThere are crucial discussions ahead, especially about how the projects will be funded. Talk has been to use tax increment financing where property taxes on the land is frozen for decades with the increased taxes generated by the project going to pay off loans financing the development of the property.\nA rift between the city and the CWDI has developed over recent months, perhaps a reflection of the previous secretive nature of the development corporation. Perhaps it is growing concern in the city about the long-term effects of tax increment financing.\nThe widening rift and a proposed city ordinance that CWDI opposes prompted current Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. city-appointed board member Shay Lewis-Sisco to attend the Jan. 8 council meeting.\n\"CWDI is doing things to meet the needs of what the commissioners are asking, as well as working diligently to strengthen the relationship between the city and CWDI,\" she said. \"I do believe, as we've stated in previous meetings outside of the council meeting, that we all have the same heart and the same mind to see, not only CWDI's project come to fruition, but that the community also benefits and it makes sense for the city at large.\"\nWe, too, hope the project comes to fruition. Its success depends on more openness by Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. and all of the government agencies it partners with. It would be a mistake for those involved to take the Open Meetings Compliance board ruling as an invitation to be more secretive and less transparent to the public. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We've had officers out on traffic stops who couldn't be contacted, on calls where they couldn't be contacted.\"\nBacorn said up to 75% of the $107,425 pricetag could be covered by grant money from the US Department of Agriculture. Even so, Getchell said ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) funds were available, enabling the town to commit to ordering them. It will be Bacorn said the \"backbone of Caroline County's radio system is a Motorola system. The compatibility is just better, the features are much better. So we're looking to upgrade and, more importantly, increase officers' safety.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Voters should decide who represents them in Annapolis\n\n February 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 654\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the 2024 General Assembly session, discussion is again underway on changing the roles and responsibilities of local Republican central committees and local Democratic central committees.The primary focus of these committees has historically been on recruiting and supporting political candidates.\nUnder current law, local central committees also have a key role to play whenever a vacancy occurs in the General Assembly resulting from \"death, disqualification, resignation, refusal to act, or expulsion of a state senator or delegate, or in the case of a senator's or delegate's removal from the city or county from which he or she was elected.\"\nWhen that occurs, the local central committee or central committees in the legislative district with the same party affiliation as the departed member are charged with making a recommendation to the governor on a replacement. The recommended individual must have the same party affiliation as the departed member. The governor, in turn, \"must, in accordance with specified procedures, appoint a person affiliated with the same political party to serve the remainder of the vacating senator's or delegate's unexpired term.\"\nSuch appointments are far more common than one might think.\nOf the 188 members currently serving in the General Assembly, almost one fourth were not elected by the voters, but were appointed to fill a vacancy and complete an unexpired term.\nEven more vacancy appointments may occur in 2024 if incumbent General Assembly members win bids for other offices and resign from their present office.\nReaching consensus in changes to the current vacancy process has been and is elusive. Presently, there are three proposals under active consideration, each with supporters and opponents.\nOne proposal would allow central committees to fill vacancies but would require public notice of vacancies and information on a central committee's application and interview process. It would require central committee interviews and votes to be open to the public and central committee members who apply to fill a vacancy to recuse themselves from the recommendation vote.\nAnother proposal would allow central committees to continue to fill vacancies but subject their recommendations to voter ratification under certain circumstances. Recommendations made in the first two years of an unexpired term would be subject to voter approval in the next presidential election. In the second two years of the unexpired term, the appointed individual would have the option of running in the next state election.\nA third proposal would replace the current appointment process with special elections. If the vacancy occurs within the first three years of a term, voters in the district would fill that vacancy through special primary and general elections. If the vacancy occurs within the fourth year, central committees would name an initial replacement who would have to run for election in the next primary election. This proposal requires an amendment to the state constitution which needs a three-fifths vote of approval in the House and the Senate then voter approval in a statewide referendum.\nConcerns have been raised about this third proposal based on estimated costs incurred by local and state boards of elections to administer multiple special elections.\nThe General Assembly is currently discussing a proposed $63.1 billion annual state budget. They also are discussing moving forward on an additional $3.8 billion in new state and local funding for public education over the next 10 years as mandated by the Blueprint for Maryland's Future (the Kirwan Report).\nEmily Scarr at the Maryland Public Interest Research Group recently opined that special elections are \"the cost of having a democracy. People have [a right] to vote for who represents them. It's a fundamental thing and if we're not spending money to ensure that right, what are we doing?\"\nI agree.\nNow is the time to address the outsized role of political central committees and the governor in the process to fill vacancies in the General Assembly.\nThe way to do that is a new process that maximizes opportunities to let the voters decide.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant. He lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Dorchester County Council introduces rental registration legislation, zoning code amendment\n\n February 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 614\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — The Dorchester County Council introduced two housing-related pieces of legislation at its meeting on Feb. 6.The first piece of legislation deals with rental properties. If passed, vacant buildings, short-term rentals and rental units would need to be registered with the county annually.\nShort-term rentals are defined as properties that are rented for more than 15 days and less than 30 days.\nCounty Planning and Zoning Director Susan Webb said the intent of creating these three different registrations is life safety and property maintenance. She said that with this registration, the county would be able to contact property managers in case of an emergency.\n\"Right now we don't have anything,\" she said. \"If there's a vacant property out there, and there's a fire and the person lives out of state or out of the area, we have no way of contacting them.\"\nWebb said the registration would also keep property owners accountable when it comes to property maintenance and following county codes and regulations.\n\"We don't get a lot of complaints about rental properties, but when we do, they're deplorable,\" she said.\nWebb said although code enforcers aren't firemen and policemen, creating these registries and being proactive can help save lives.\nCurrently, the county doesn't know how many vacant and rental properties there are in the county, Webb said.\n\"We need to see how many we do have, and how much time and manpower we have to put into these properties,\" she said.\nBecause of this, Webb said the Council might have to revisit this legislation in the future to make it stronger.\nThe second piece of legislation would amend the zoning chapter of the county code to lessen restrictions on residential accessory structures.\nWebb said 75% of the county's Board of Appeals cases in the past two years have been for accessory structures that are greater than what is allowed by county code. She said this has incurred more legal fees for the county and made meetings longer.\n\"We need to make a difference,\" she said. \"I mean we've had some meetings that have gone later than 10 o'clock at night because the agenda's so big.\"\nWebb said she thinks this amendment would provide relief to both property owners and county staff.\nIf passed, the amendment would make it so that, for lot size of up to 1.99 acres, a residential accessory structure could not exceed 200% of the building footprint of the principal residential structure.\nFor a lot size of two acres to 4.99 acres, a residential accessory structure could not exceed 300% of the building footprint of the principal residential structure.\nFor a lot size of five acres or more, a residential accessory structure could not exceed 500% of the building footprint of the principal residential structure.\nAccording to current county code, for suburban residential, suburban residential-RCA, rural residential and rural residential-RCA zoning districts, the sum total of residential accessory structures on a property cannot exceed the building footprint of the principal residential structure or 1,200 square feet, whichever is greater, without a special exception by the Board of Appeals.\nFor agricultural conservation, agricultural conservation-RCA, resource conservation, resource conservation-RCA and rural residential-conservation zoning districts, the sum total of residential accessory structures on a property cannot exceed the building footprint of the principal residential structure or 1,600 square feet, whichever is greater, without a special exception by the Board of Appeals.\nAt the meeting, Council Vice President Mike Detmer verified the amendment would not give anyone permission to use the residential accessory structure for commercial use.\n\"Absolutely not,\" Webb said in response. \"Every permit that comes into the office, I review and sign off on use to make sure that is compliant with zoning.\"\nCouncil President Lenny Pfeffer said public hearings will be held for both of these pieces of legislation. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Oxford votes on two items at Commissioners meeting\n\n February 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 612\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — At a Commissioners of Oxford meeting Tuesday evening, the Commissioners approved an ordinance that establishes zoning regulations for cannabis businesses as well as an application for FEMA technical assistance.CANNABIS BUSINESSES ZONING ORDINANCE\nThe Commissioners approved an ordinance on zoning regulations for cannabis businesses that would permit cannabis dispensaries and processing facilities as a special exception in Oxford's general commercial zoning districts (C-2).\nThe ordinance would also permit growing facilities as a special exception in Oxford's commercial industrial district.\nA nine-month cannabis moratorium, which temporarily blocked applications, site plans, permits, construction, processing and approval for businesses looking to manufacture or sell recreational or medicinal cannabis in Oxford, will run its course at the end of month.\nTown Attorney Lyndsey Ryan said that Oxford must establish reasonable zoning regulations for cannabis businesses and not be more burdensome than the town's regulations on similar businesses.\nUnder this ordinance, each applicant will have to come to the Board of Appeals to prove the business meets the criteria of a special exception, which includes the most appropriate use of land building and structure, adequate ingress and egress, and adequate utilities.\nFEMA ASSISTSNCE\nThe Commissioners also voted to apply for the FEMA Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Direct Technical Assistance application.\nThis program provides a wide range of non-financial support to communities that may not have the resources to begin climate resilience planning.It will deliver up to 36 months of technical assistance for the town.\nIdentified hazards for Oxford include erosion, flood, hurricane winds, rising sea levels and storm surge.\nPUBLIC COMMENT\nTransparency was a theme throughout public comment at the town meeting Tuesday. Residents asked questions about the town's stormwater management and how the town receives and uses grant monies.\nAt the beginning of public comment, resident Deborah Pulzone read a letter addressed to the Commissioners of Oxford and the town's citizens. In her letter, Pulzone said that for 2021 and 2022, there was only one Maryland Public Information Act filed. In contrast, from Jan. 1, 2023 to Jan. 30 of this year, Pulzone said 30 PIAs were filed.\n\"It is obvious that these PIAs have become weaponized,\" she said. \"It appears they were made for the sole purpose of keeping our town employees preoccupied with busy paperwork, thereby making it extremely difficult to function in a productive and cost-effective manner.\"\nAfter Pulzone received an applause from some residents for her comments, resident Jan Greenhawk said that although she has never written a PIA, the people who have filed them have done so for a reason.\n\"We don't have anything against our employees,\" she said. \"In fact, our employees do a great job. But the problem is, when you don't have transparency, and when decisions are made that no one understands or knows about, then people will ask questions. And if they don't think they can get the answers, then they file PIAs.\"\nGreenhawk said it is the right of town residents to ask questions.\nWhile Greenhawk was speaking, a moment of tension between her and Pulzone caused Commission President Tom Costigan to say, \"Please keep it civil.\"\nLike Pulzone, Greenhawk also received an applause from some residents for her comments.\nLIVING SHORELINE\nDuring the meeting Tuesday, Town Manager Cheryl Lewis said resident Jennifer Stanley will be installing a living shoreline to prevent erosion across the front of her property. Lewis said Stanley is willing to extend the living shoreline to include the end of First Street, which is owned by the town.\nLewis said Stanley knows the end of First Street is used to take out kayaks and other small boats, and so Stanley would incorporate that into the design.\nStanley is asking the commissioners if they would like her to extend the shoreline, Lewis said. This would not be a cost to the town. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Oxford town manager to retire at end of June\n\n February 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 710\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — Cheryl Lewis, Oxford's town manager of more than a decade, will be retiring June 30.Lewis, who has worked for the town since 2012, made the announcement at a Commissioners of Oxford meeting Tuesday.\nBefore making the announcement, Lewis discussed the town's progress in hiring four open positions in the town, including a planning and zoning coordinator, a clerk-treasurer and a police chief.\n\"As you can see, I'm kind of working through a transition of replacements,\" Lewis said.\nOver the next several months, Lewis plans to get the town administration positions filled so that she can set up a \"somewhat seamless\" transition, where people have been hired and trained for their roles before she leaves.\nADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS\nDuring the meeting, Lewis said the planning and zoning coordinator position has been filled.\nIn an interview Wednesday, Lewis said Marilyn Williams from the Wicomico County Department of Planning, Zoning and Community Development has been hired for the job.\nThe position, which was previously held by Maria Brophy, Lewis' daughter, was posted on Dec. 28. Lewis said at the meeting Tuesday that Williams will begin working at the end of February.\nThe clerk-treasurer is a new position for the Town of Oxford.\nAt the meeting Tuesday, Lewis said she has recommended to the commissioners that the town try to hire clerk-treasurer by the end of February so that person can begin working by the end of March.\nAccording to the job posting on the town's website, the new hire will be tasked with directing and managing the town's finances under the town manager's direction and implementing policy set by the Commissioners of Oxford. The clerk-treasurer will act as the chief financial officer of the town.\nThe creation of this position was talked about at a Jan. 11 Commissioners meeting, when Commissioner Katrina Greer said she wanted to discuss the possibility of hiring someone to take on the town's financial duties.\nAt the Jan. 11 meeting, Greer said this could address a material weakness detailed in the town's audit for the town's lack of internal controls. This has been a finding in town audits going back to 2016.\nOnce the town has brought in a planning and zoning coordinator and a clerk-treasurer, Lewis said she recommends the town advertise for a new town manager. At the meeting Tuesday, she said the town manager would \"replace the remaining bits and pieces\" of her job, which would be split up by having three town administration positions, not including an administrative assistant.\n\"I do believe, in order to seamlessly move forward, that you will need to bring in three people,\" she said. \"You're going to have to disburse the workload. You can't just have a person come and replace me and pick up all three of these pieces.\"\nLewis said there have not been any discussions yet regarding the salary range for the town manager position, but she said it will be included in the job posting. According to the clerk-treasurer job posting, the estimated salary range for that position is $60,000 to $80,000 per year.\nOTHER OPEN POSITIONS\nThe town is also in need of a new police chief and a new public works member.\nOxford Police Chief Eric Kellner stepped down from his position in January for \"personal and professional reasons,\" but is staying with the police department as an officer. The department's Lieutenant Chris Phillips has stepped up as interim chief.\nAt the meeting Tuesday, Lewis said she planned to post the chief position online Wednesday and hopes the town can hire a new chief by mid-March so that person can begin working in April.\nMike McWilliams, will be leaving the town's Public Works Department. Public Works Wastewater Superintendent Matt Ozman said McWilliams came to work for Oxford from the City of Cambridge and is going back to the City of Cambridge.\nLewis said she hopes to get the job posting up for McWilliams' position in the next week or two.\nToward the end of the meeting, Greer thanked Lewis for the \"well thought out\" transition plans.\nCommissioner Susan Delean-Botkin said she had worked with Lewis for 12 years now.\n\"I've worked for a lot of people in my 50 years of business,\" she said. \"And I have never met anyone as confident and as caring as you are to this town. Thank you. Thank you for this transition.\"\nAfter Delean-Botkin spoke, the room erupted in applause. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The parcel where the treatment plant is located was proposed to be subdivided into several lots to better manage different treatment processes.\nOne lot would contain the treatment plant facilities, while others would be designated as spray fields or potential future spray fields.\nThe subdivision was approved unanimously by the commission.\nDuring the discussion on the planned unit development documents for Lakeside and the Phase 1D subdivision plan, the Planning Commission made fundamental changes to the documents, including relabeling and redesignating open space areas for clarity, which showed that the overall open space had increased despite no changes to land area or impervious surfaces.\nAdditionally, a 2.3-acre park area within Phase 1D will be split into two smaller park spaces on either side of a new development road.\nA special Planning Commission meeting has been scheduled for March 11 at 4:30 p.m. to discuss and potentially approve the 1D subdivision plan.\nThe commission discussed the cannabis ordinance for zoning, addressing what constituted a \"similar business\" regarding restrictions, skepticism of serious applicants and a concern for the permitted locations where dispensaries could run a business.\nOne commissioner suggested that the town should focus more on cannabis growing and production facilities rather than dispensaries, possibly in light industrial zones. Further discussion will take place during the special Planning Commission meeting next month. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I've been in spaces now and held my own,\" said Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Maryland Angela Alsobrooks.Approaching the May primaries, she is one of several candidates vying to represent Democrats in the race for the state's open senate seat.\n\"This race is not only important to the state of Maryland, but to the country,\" Alsobrooks said.\nOn Sunday, she spoke at a meet-and-greet hosted by the Democratic Club of Kent County held at Minary's Dream Alliance in Chestertown.\nHer opponent, Democrat David Trone, who has represented Maryland's 6th Congressional District in the House of Representatives since 2019, spoke at Washington College back in Dec. 7.\nAs reported by Washington College press, Trone stressed working across the aisle on issues like the opioid epidemic, drug and alcohol addiction, mental health issues, criminal justice reform, structural racism, climate crisis and education.\nAlsobrooks, a former two-term state's attorney, expressed passion for some of the same things, growing economic opportunity, investing in education and making sure people are safe.\nLike Trone, Alsobrooks encouraged reaching out to Republicans on important issues. She saw that differing perspectives are not something to run from.\nAlsobrooks brought up many bipartisan opportunities in the future and some in the past lost over partisan politics.\nIn healthcare, Republicans worked to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, she said.\nOn Economic Issues, there are infrastructure bills both can agree on, she said.\nIn poreign policy, they need people who can exercise a diplomacy-first approach.\n\"Freedom defines our way of life as Americans. America needs to be a strong leader around the world and protect our allies,\" she said.\nAlsobrooks noted Ukraine as an ally, and the need to support them against Russian President Vladimir Putin. She said Isreal is an ally that needs support as well.\nAlsobrooks wants her experience to speak for itself, but she said she is aware her history as a Black woman plays a role. If elected, she said she'll stand in the gap for rights she said are under attack, such as voting rights and LGBTQ rights.\n\"There's no women representing us. Our delegation is talented but not diverse. Of the eight congressmen and two senators, all are men. It is time to send a woman to Washington so our lived experiences are there. I believe every one of us should look at the State and see ourselves. Every race, gender, background, socioeconomic level, makes us stronger if all of us are represented.\"\nAlsobrooks went on to address former Governor, Republican Larry Hogan, who announced his intentions to run for Senate seat on Feb.9.\nSome pundits have speculated if he wins the Republican primary, that would force Democrats to divert resources usually spent in other states.\nHogan, who Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said was the \"get of the year,\" as put by Alsobrooks, would help Republicans gain a majority in the Senate.\nSenior Adviser of her campaign David Sloan pointed out that Kent County went blue for former president Barack Obama in 2008.\n\"On May 14, this county's going green for Angela Alsobrooks,\" he said.\nAlsobrooks said, \"I can really make a difference to our state. In a body that needs a difference-maker I can shake loose some of the gridlock in Washington.\"\nAlsobrooks' next stop was in Easton, capping off her Eastern Shore visit. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

During construction, the project will utilize off-peak lane closures during the day to get work areas ready to ensure successful night work.\nThe eastbound span will close at night, weather permitting, with two-way traffic in effect on the westbound span. Crews will remove at least one section of the deck and replace it with a new precast section during the same overnight shift.\nDuring construction, the project will utilize existing off-peak lane closures during the day to get work areas ready to ensure successful night work.\nWeather permitting, when the eastbound span closes at night, two-way traffic will be on the westbound span. Temporary joint-connection grates will be utilized for this crucial work, allowing for travel lanes to reopen each morning and for a smoother driving transition across work areas.\nWhile the work is significant, the MDTA has designed the project to limit traffic impacts while maximizing safety for contractors and customers during this crucial work.\nCranes are in place and visible while crossing the bridge. Transportation Authority officials urge drivers to be alert and not distracted by construction.\nWork is underway to relocate existing electrical power, communication and fiber-optic lines from the roadway barriers to a dedicated utility corridor.\nRelocation of the utilities will not only eliminate the need for temporary relocation during construction of the new roadway deck and barriers; the under deck location will be accessed for maintenance activities without working in a temporary roadway closure.\nInstallation of the new conduits will be staged from the water, with barges and cranes used to lift material and equipment to temporary under-deck platforms located adjacent to the access catwalk. Almost 10 miles of new conduit will be installed as part of this project.\nA top priority of the Transportation Authority is protecting the environment. For the eastbound deck replacement project, the MDTA is using environmentally sensitive technologies and construction practices to reduce environmental impacts on plants and wildlife in the vicinity of the Bay Bridge and beyond. As part of the Maryland Artificial Reef Program, the MDTA will recycle deck panels removed during this project.\nThese deck panels will be deposited at the existing Love Point artificial reef located in an approximately 20-25 feet deep, 50-acre area in the Chesapeake Bay northeast of the Bay Bridge. It is estimated that approximately 145,000 square feet of deck will be deposited.\nA Stormwater Management Plan includes a 1.04 acre pocket pond that is proposed to address the stormwater management needs of the deck replacement project. The pocket pond will be constructed in a grassy area bounded by U.S. Route 50 westbound lanes, Revell Highway, and the ramp from Oceanic Drive to westbound Route 50 on the western shore.\nThe pocket pond will provide treatment of runoff from existing, untreated pavement owned by the MDTA along westbound Route 50 and improve the hydrology in this area.\nAs part of the landscape management plan, turf grass will be planted and native grass species will be established around the pond including tussock sedge, pickerelweed, arrow arum, lizard's tail and soft stem bulrush. On the Eastern Shore, an approximately 1.1 acre site will be treated for invasive species and replanted with native species.\nAdditional information is available at mdta.maryland.gov. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They can see them very clearly flashing, and they know not to land on the runway.\"\nThe airport has gone to further lengths for extra layers of safety.\n\"In addition, we have physically turned off the instrument landing system for Runway 4/22, so pilots cannot inadvertently receive the landing data,\" Risher said. \"We have got some barricades out there. We have turned off other visual aids for that runway.\"\nThere is another runway in use while 4/22 is closed until April 9.\n\"We have a second runway, 15/33, that is still operational,\" he said.\n4/22 will be closed for a month, then will reopen for a month before being closed again for construction. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This candidate will hold office for a one-year term expiring May 2025. The election will be held at the Trappe Town Council meeting room on Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.The elected candidate will fill the remainder of former Trappe Town Council President Nicholas Newnam's term. Newnam resigned from his position earlier this year.\nJeremy Newnam is the only candidate listed on the ballot. Stephanie Chester and Marcell Pritchett are running as write-in candidates.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the three candidates competing for the seat to ask questions about their campaigns.\nSTEPHANIE CHESTERWhy are you running?\n\"I believe that council representatives should be committed servants. I would be the bridge that assists citizens in bringing their issues to the council and simultaneously be part of seeking solutions.\"\nWhat are your hopes for the town?\n\"That it continues to be a safe small town, maintaining its historic character; that its businesses thrive and keep up with today's economy. That its sense of community is enhanced.\"\nTell me about your thoughts on Lakeside.\n\"Lakeside is here now. It is imperative that it behaves like a good and contributing citizen to the welfare of Trappe. It serves no purpose to rehash the issues concerning whether or not Lakeside was a good investment for the Town of Trappe. That decision having been made, the better question is what issues does its presence present that impact its immediate neighbors and the town in general.\nThere are concerns about tanks … impacting neighboring property. The xouncil needs to address this immediately.\"\nWhat skills will you bring to the commission?\n\"Thirty years of teaching in the public school system has taught me to be a good listener, problem solver, motivator, leader and team player. These skills I believe would prove invaluable to making the Town Council and the community work closer together.\"\nWhat would you like to say to the community of Trappe?\n\"I would like to be your partner in keeping Trappe historic, safe and enjoyable. I would like to be your voice to convey concerns and your assistant in providing solutions.\"\nJEREMY NEWNAMWhy are you running?\n\"I'm a firm believer in doing your part within your community. I've served in the Fire Department for the better part of a decade and believe there is still more for me to do to better serve my community that I call home.\"\nWhat are your thoughts on Lakeside?\n\"I believe Lakeside provides adequate housing opportunities to bring in new residents to the community but also continues the growth of the town in the commercial atmosphere. I hope with the increased population commercial entities will be interested in filling a void within the community causing residents to travel to nearby towns for their necessities.\"\nHow do you plan to attract business to the town?\n\"By exploring adding additional amenities to the Town of Trappe for the existing residents first, I hope to then draw other nearby residents with the appeal of the town.\"\nWhat skills will you bring to the commission?\n\"I believe in the service for others, not the service for yourself. I have held numerous administrative roles throughout my life. Most importantly I have lived in Trappe for the majority of my life and been a town resident for over five years, my decision within my community directly affect the place I have called home for so long.\"\nWhat would you like to say to the community of Trappe?\n\"Regardless of who the residents vote for, I encourage everyone to come out and vote if possible. Their vote impacts the day to day operations of the area they call home, the area I've called home for the majority of my life.\"\nMARCELL PRITCHETTWhy are you running?\n\"I would like to continue to be able to help the folks of Trappe, Maryland, and to be involved with the local government. I attended several other training events and just looking out for the people in Trappe just so they have a voice.\"\nWhat are your hopes for the town?\n\"The hope for the town is to continue to grow. And for everyone to be able to really work together.\"\nWhat are your thoughts on Lakeside?\n\"I think Lakeside is a wonderful idea. And it seems to be going well.

    "content": "Maryland debates “local” wind farm, way offshore\n\n March 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LYDIA HURLEY Capital News Service | Section: General Assembly \n \n 644\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Maryland wants to expand its use of renewable energy by encouraging local projects like wind turbines.But one company's plan to build windmills in waters off the coast is running into trouble this session in the General Assembly, where lawmakers worry about giving their economic support to a project that isn't exactly local.\nThe proposed project would be built off the coast of Virginia Beach — close by, but technically outside Maryland waters.\nOne lawmaker wants to help the company building it, Avangrid Renewables, by making a wording change in a Maryland law that defines who is eligible to sell energy credits to the state. Her bill would expand the current law to let Maryland buy and sell energy credits from a company whose planned wind turbines are closer to the shores of Virginia and North Carolina.\nThe measure is \"a crucial step towards removing obstacles to offshore wind development in Maryland,\" said Sen. Mary Washington (D-Baltimore City), who is sponsoring the measure. \"This bill has the potential to expedite the state's transition to renewable energy.\"\nBut when the General Assembly bought into a set of ambitious renewable energy goals last year, they did so partly because advocates had convinced them they would be beneficial to the local economy. Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George's) argues that those local economic benefits would not materialize for Marylanders if the wind farms were built in other states.\n\"We want to have the power, of course — we want to have the renewable energy,\" Augustine told Capital News Service. \"But we also want to have that economic benefit that's associated with the development… stay here.\"\nThe bill follows last year's POWER Act, which established Maryland's goal of procuring 8.5 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2031, dramatically increasing the state's previous goal.\nRenewable energy generators like Avangrid said this bill could help the state meet its goal by supporting the construction of more than one local offshore wind project on the PJM grid, a power grid that connects several states, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland. Maryland's pledge of support as a future energy credit buyer would help advance any project.\n\"This lease area that we're talking about is gigantic,\" said Ken Kimmell, Avangrid's vice president of development for offshore wind. \"So it's quite possible that the lease area could support a project for Maryland and also a project for Virginia.\"\nBoth states would benefit environmentally and economically, Kimmell said. There are proposed \"marshaling ports\" in Baltimore where the wind turbine's parts would be staged for installation, he said. In addition, the use of union laborers at these ports would benefit Maryland, Kimmell added.\nOther lawmakers are not yet convinced. Some are worried about the negative impacts of offshore wind in general and have concerns about the costs of expanding these initiatives.\nOcean City residents have voiced concerns about offshore wind's impact on the tourism industry, said Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Worcester and Wicomico). She has raised concerns about the potential impact on military training and exercises in the area, as well as fishing and marine life.\n\"There was an expert that testified at the congressional hearing in Ocean City that talked about the impact of the noise on the whales . . . whether it's the drilling of the turbines or whether it's the sound from the turbines themselves that would cause harm to the whales and other marine life,\" she said. \"You also have then whether the project even makes sense from a cost perspective.\"\nAugustine is also concerned that it doesn't make sense. \"How in the world does something landing in North Carolina benefit Maryland?\" he asked in the bill hearing last week.\nLawmakers are open to other legislation this session that would propel the state further toward its renewable energy goals.\nBut legislators still aren't big fans of this particular effort. And with time running out before a crucial session deadline, the bill may stall for now. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge city manager resigns over concerns with CWDI\n\n March 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 909\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Tom Carroll, Cambridge's city manager of two years, submitted his resignation on Monday.In a letter addressed to the mayor and commissioners, Carroll said his last day as city manager will be no later than May 17.\nCarroll shared the news of his resignation with City Council Monday night in a closed session following the council meeting.\n\"This was a hard decision for me to reach, but I do know it is the right decision to make,\" he wrote in an email to the Star Democrat Tuesday morning.\nIn an interview Tuesday afternoon, Carroll said he has accepted a city manager position for the City of Lexington, Virginia. He said that in December, he came to the decision to pursue employment outside of Cambridge in the new year.\nThe reason for this decision, he said, was his concerns with Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc.'s Cambridge Harbor project, a project to develop the space along the Cambridge waterfront. Specifically, Carroll pointed to three events that led to his decision.\nThe first was a Dec. 15 email from CWDI Executive Director Matt Leonard. The email, sent to CWDI stakeholders, said the city's words and actions were jeopardizing CWDI's deal with a company to build a hotel, Carroll said.\nWhen Carroll, at the request of City Council President Lajan Cephas, reached out to two of the city's representatives on the CWDI board, he said he didn't hear back from them on the topic for months.\nAlong with this, Carroll said CWDI's \"fussiness\" regarding a now indefinitely tabled ordinance that would give the city the authority to appoint an individual to represent the city on a non-city governed board — and also remove that individual, and subsequently impose a fine or jail time if the individual continued to act as a representative of the city on said board — made it clear that CWDI was unwilling to change any part of its plan in response to criticism from the city.\nCarroll said the third event that led to his decision was when he learned of a \"significant ethical issue\" involving CWDI's attorney. CWDI is represented by the law firm Miles and Stockbridge.\nThis is not the first time Carroll has spoken about his concerns with the Cambridge Harbor project.\nIn late October, a letter addressed to Leonard and signed by Carroll stated that Cambridge City Council was not in support of the plans for the project. The letter stated concerns with the CWDI's governance, the proposed tax increment financing and the lack of a private sector development partner for a project of this size.\nCarroll himself said in a September interview that having spent 27 years in local governments and having been a part of two major economic development projects, he had concerns with the financial feasibility of CWDI's plan.\nIn his email to the Star Democrat, Carroll said he hopes that he is wrong and that Cambridge Harbor will \"become a story book success.\"\n\"But I fear that I will be correct in its lasting and long-term negative impacts for Cambridge unless it is fundamentally changed,\" he wrote. \"I can no longer standby while this project moves forward in its current form and with the current governance structure.\"\nLeonard said Carroll's reasons for leaving are his reasons.\n\"I don't know what all the reasons are,\" Leonard said. \"If that's the one he has chosen promote, I'm sorry to see that. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but his reasons are his reasons.\"\nLeonard said one of the reasons CWDI was formed was to have an organization in place that can \"transcend political turmoil or disruptions in leadership.\"\n\"We've done everything we can to make sure that we can continue the progress on the project despite political changes,\" he said.\nIn his Monday letter to the mayor and commissioners, Carroll mentioned some of the city's accomplishments since he began serving as city manager, including the Cambridge Police Department's commitment to community policing and the city's undertaking of significant capital projects.\nHe said he was \"particularly proud\" of the city's wages and classifications system that has helped the city's workforce become more reflective of the community.\nIn a press release, Mayor Stephen Rideout said he and the commissioners are saddened by Carroll's decision to leave, and his expertise will be missed.\nIn an interview, Rideout called Carroll leaving a a significant loss for the city. He said the city has been making progress like he hasn't seen since it established its current form of government in 2015.\nCity Council President Lajan Cephas called Carroll a gift to Cambridge, adding that he has made a lasting impact on the city.\n\"Although he's leaving, he's still going to be with us, with the changes that he's made,\" she said.\nBoth Rideout and Cephas said they still have concerns about Cambridge Harbor. Cephas said her concerns lie with the direction CWDI's leadership is going in.\nRideout said this search for the next city manager will begin soon. The mayor and commissioners are responsible for hiring for the position. Carroll said he has offered to assist with the first steps in recruiting the next city manager.\nIn the interview Tuesday, Carroll said he expected to serve the rest of his career in Cambridge.\n\"I love Cambridge and think it has so much potential,\" he said. \"I think this community will benefit by getting very serious about structural racism that we have in this community. And CWDI, the Cambridge Harbor project is something that makes me feel like their approach to this project demonstrates that Cambridge isn't serious about that important conversation.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This project would require $105,000, including items like a flat-top grill, oven, fryer and hood unit.\nSetter provided financial projections to the council, showing that with the new projects, revenues could increase to around $3 million annually once the new facilities are open and fully operational.\nThe goal, Setter said, would be for the golf course, which is owned and operated by the county, to become more financially self-sufficient over time and generate enough revenue to pay for its capital projects and operations without needing as much subsidy from the Talbot County general fund.\n\"We're basically creating a whole new business,\" said Settler of the golf course's renovations, many of which are already underway.\nThe project will cost about $2.4 million as laid out in a previous meeting, not including Setter's $105,000 ask.\nCouncil members Lynn Mielke and Dave Stepp supported the changes to the golf course.\n\"I'm the only one that has seen one of these driving ranges and how popular and successful it is,\" Mielke said. \"That makes an impact on me in terms of my view on proceeding on this and making an investment.\"\nCouncil members Chuck Callahan, Keasha Haythe and Pete Lesher were more hesitant about investing further into the project.\nHaythe said it was essential to treat this as a new business and take a more conservative approach to the revenue produced during its first fiscal year. Funds have already been provided for other capital projects, like the driving range enhancements.\nCallahan suggested that they wait a bit longer before approving the decision. Haythe and Lesher agreed with this statement.\n\"It's a business decision that we have to make with the taxpayers' money,\" Callahan said. \"I would feel a bit more comfortable waiting to see.\"\nStepp and Mielke protested.\n\"My theory on this is if we're going to do it, let's do it right,\" Stepp said. \"Let's get everything in place because we're going to have an opportunity here for a lot of first impressions.\"\nSetter stressed that revenue would drastically decrease if the business were unable to sell hot food, which ultimately changed the minds of Callahan, Haythe and Lesher. The council approved fully funding the kitchen improvements at the golf course.\nIf approved in FY2025 budget and advance funds are allocated. Setter said they hope to complete kitchen renovations before the \"true grand opening\" in 2025. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Conditional uses are uses listed in each zoning district permitted under certain conditions of the Town Code.\nVariances require more unique circumstance standards for the Board of Appeals to review than current conditional use permits, Moredock said.\nAt the March 12 public hearing, with concerns that longer piers can affect public use of waterways, residents spoke in favor of the ordinance to tighten up reviews for pier extension applications further than the normally allotted 150 feet.\nJay Falstad of the Queen Anne's Conservation Association noted property ownership stops at the shore line and it wasn't unreasonable to ask a landowner to have a higher burden when requesting longer piers.\nThe change to the ordinance would not automatically deny applications for a longer pier but \"puts forth a little bit higher of a standard,\" he said.\nIf allowed to go unchecked, longer piers jetting into the water could create an eyesore, and larger boats can utilize marinas, he said.\nBilly Benton, vice president of the Queen Anne's County Watermen's Association stated longer piers can impede on the working areas of crabbing and clamming.\nOn the other side, representing a client that has had a conditional use application in the works for months, Jeff Thompson of Thompson and Richard LLP requested the variance ordinance provide a grandfather condition.\nPier extension requests can be for a number of factors including water depth not just boat size, he said.\nHis client's request has been in the queue for months and Thompson was worried the variance bill approval would trump that.\nIt had not been the Board of Appeals' intention to \"pull out the rug\" from under current conditional use applicants with the proposed amendment, Moredock, said, noting it had not been realized that projects in the pipeline would be affected by the ordinance.\n\"Since 2002, we've had 45 conditional use applications for pier extensions greater than 150, all were approved. The greatest distance was 495,\" Long Range Principal Planner Stephanie Jones said.\nCommissioner Jack Wilson requested additional information about the average pier length requested more than 150 feet.\nPublic comment will be open until the commissioners will return to discussion at its next meeting March 26.\nIn other business, the council approved a map amendment to upgrade the sewer and water services of the Foxx Farm property in Sudlersville to permit services on demand, calling it \"long overdue.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Returning Bay ferry servicey faces choppy waters\n\n April 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 500\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On June 30, 1952, a ribbon-cutting in Anne Arundel County marked the beginning and the end of transportation options between Maryland's Eastern Shore and western shore. On that day, the first Chesapeake Bay Bridge opened for vehicular traffic. That same day, a ferry service that had carried 2 million passengers and 1 million vehicles on the Bay since being launched in 1930 ended.Conventional wisdom then was ferry service would never return to the Bay. Now an effort is underway to return ferry service that is very different from that which ended abruptly 72 years ago.\nCurrently nine Maryland counties — Queen Anne's, Anne Arundel, Calvert, Somerset, St. Mary's, Wicomico, Talbot, Kent, and Dorchester plus the city of Annapolis — are working with a consultant to study the feasibility of a new passenger only ferry service on the Bay. Their final report will include recommendations on next steps if the consultant's feasibility study concludes such a service is viable and sustainable. It is a work in progress. Routes may be added deleted or modified.\nWith all due respect to the supporters of this concept, I suggest there are two critical issues they need to consider if they have not done so already.\nOne issue is the ferry vessel under serious consideration for the proposed new service. It is the Candela P-12 all-electric ferry. It sells for approximately $2 million, does not carry vehicles, seats a maximum of 30 passengers, and has limited storage space for carry-ons such as bicycles, strollers and wheelchairs.\nThis vessel will not be a practical alternative for the huge number of tourists who use Route 50 when going to Ocean City (\"downy shore\").\nAccordingly, this proposed new ferry service is not likely to generate significant support from Eastern Shore residents and public officials hoping for a solution to regular summer traffic jams on Route 50.\nThe second issue is the increasingly limited potential for state funding for this concept.\nDuring the past several weeks in the General Assembly, there has been intense (and yet to be resolved) differences of opinion on how to address structural deficits in the state transportation trust fund and projected structural deficits in the state budget. Those deficits are almost certain to become worse based on the devastating impact on the state economy and state revenues from the tragic collapse of the Key Bridge in Baltimore.\nSecuring state funding for the launch and operation of a new ferry service on the Bay is not going to be a high priority in Annapolis in the foreseeable future.\nI am not suggesting these are insurmountable obstacles or the only obstacles. I am suggesting they are very serious obstacles that cannot be ignored by the proponents of returning ferry service on the Bay.\nOne path forward may be securing private investment for this concept from investors with the resources to launch and operate it.\nOtherwise, returning ferry service to the Chesapeake Bay may be an interesting idea whose time has not yet come.\nDavid Reel is a public relations and public affairs consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge mayor proposes amendments to CWDI Articles of Incorporation\n\n April 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 762\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — In an effort to get the relationship between Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. and the City of Cambridge \"back on track,\" Mayor Stephen Rideout is proposing amendments to the organization's Articles of Incorporation.According to CWDI's Articles of Incorporation, the mayor of Cambridge is its sole member. This means that Rideout has the authority to make amendments to the Articles of Incorporation.\nTuesday morning, Rideout conducted a meeting to share and review his proposed amendments to the Articles of Incorporation. He said he thinks these changes will benefit CWDI's Cambridge Harbor project, a project to develop the space along the Cambridge waterfront that would include a promenade, parks and a boutique hotel with a restaurant and bar.\n\"These amendments to the articles make it more likely for the project to be successful,\" Rideout said.\nCambridge Harbor has been a hot topic of conversation in recent months. On March 18, Cambridge City Manager Tom Carroll submitted his resignation and said he was resigning over concerns with the Cambridge Harbor project.\nIn late October, a letter addressed to CWDI Executive Director Matt Leonard and signed by Carroll stated that Cambridge City Council was not in support of the plans for the project.\nAt the meeting Tuesday, Rideout discussed four main areas of the six-page CWDI Articles of Incorporation document that he wishes to amend. He said he will convene another meeting in the next 10 days to make his final decision regarding the amendments, and he welcomes comments and advice from the CWDI Board of Directors and the public.\nPROPOSED AMENDMENTSThe first change Rideout proposed has to do with CWDI's membership. The amendment would make it so that Cambridge's commission president would become CWDI's sole member in the event that the city is without a mayor.\nCurrently, according to a red-lined document of the Articles of Incorporation that Rideout handed out at the end of the meeting, CWDI's Board of Directors would become the members of CWDI if the city did not have a mayor.\n\"Given the differences of opinion that have developed between the city and CWDI, having the CWDI board become the sole member in the future is not acceptable,\" Rideout said.\nRideout's second proposed change would give CWDI's sole member the exclusive right to amend the Articles of Incorporation and the ability to inspect all CWDI records and attend all open and closed CWDI board meetings.\nRideout called it \"critical\" for CWDI to be transparent and accountable to its sole member.\nThe third main change would make it so that the Articles of Incorporation \"prevail\" over CWDI's bylaws in the case that there is an inconsistency between the two. It would also require the Board of Directors to provide any proposed bylaw amendments to the sole member of CWDI at least 15 days before adoption of that proposed amendment.\nThe fourth change to the document would explicitly give the city, county and state the authority to remove and replace their appointees to the board at any time.\nRideout said he believes that — at least for the city — this authority already exists. But he said the amendment would ensure that authority.\nThis is not the first time the city has considered clarifying that authority. In the beginning of the year, the council considered an ordinance that would have given the city the authority to appoint an individual to represent the city on a non-city governed board; and also remove that individual, and subsequently impose a fine or jail time if the individual continued to act as a representative of the city on said board. At a Feb. 12 City Council meeting, the ordinance was tabled indefinitely.\nThe proposed ordinance had garnered attention from CWDI.\nIn November, Attorney J.W. Thompson Webb of Miles and Stockbridge, representing CWDI, wrote the council that the city was overreaching its authority with the ordinance. In a Jan. 2 letter from Leonard to Rideout, Leonard asked the city to abandon the ordinance altogether.\nCWDI city-appointed board member Shay Lewis-Sisco also asked for this at a Jan. 8 City Council meeting.\nToward the end of the meeting Tuesday, Rideout said that CWDI can \"regain the complete confidence of\" the city through embracing these proposed amendments.\n\"I hope my friends on the CWDI Board of Directors embrace this opportunity,\" he said.\nAfter the meeting, Leonard, who was in attendance, said he didn't have a lot he could say about the meeting because he hadn't yet had a chance to review the amendments Rideout is proposing.\n\"I believe anybody who wants to make CWDI better comes in good faith,\" Leonard said. \"We're always happy to listen to their suggestions. And so I'm going to look at it that way.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This increase will go toward the capital project request for planned Chapel District Elementary School renovations and other capital projects.\nThe increase in the education budget is due, in part, to the implications of the Maryland Blueprint for Education plan. Blueprint is a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state by increasing education funding by $3.8 billion each year over the next 10 years.\n\"Maryland Blueprint required local share funding to increase by $1.053 million for FY2025 budget,\" Martha Sparks, finance director for Talbot County, said at the Tuesday meeting. \"In addition to the mandated funding, the county has included an additional appropriation of $2.6 million. Funding to support Talbot County Schools increased overall by $3.65 million above FY24 levels.\"\nEducation spending represents 37.7% of the county's total proposed budget. These numbers include Talbot County Public Schools, Chesapeake College and the Talbot County Free Library expenses.\nThe budget also allocates an additional $1.5 million in capital improvement project funding for Talbot County Public Schools to prioritize other projects.\nThe budget discussion included the option to expand the amendment of the 1-cent increase in property tax rates for public safety.\nIn November 2020, Talbot County voters approved an amendment allowing a 1-cent increase to the property tax rate to support public safety spending. This increase began in the FY2022 budget and will continue until the FY2026 budget.\nRevenues from the 1-cent increase have been used to fund 26 new public safety positions across departments, such as deputies, paramedics, emergency medical technicians and 911 operators. The funds from the amendment have allowed for inclusion of sheriff's office, paramedics/EMTs and correctional officers in enhanced retirement programs for public safety employees.\nSparks noted that the county has used more than the funds provided by the 1-cent increase to public safety.\n\"The county has used more than the revenues generated from the 1 cent to enhance public safety personnel serving the citizens and visitors of Talbot County,\" she said.\nThe council has the option to allow county residents to extend the 1-cent increase beyond FY2026 through a ballot initiative for voters in the November 2024 general election.\nClay Stamp, county manager for Talbot County, expressed his admiration for the county's finance team for their work on the budget.\n\"There's a lot of hard work that went into drafting the FY 25 proposed balanced budget,\" Stamp said. \"While we're here tonight, I want to thank the council for your cooperation and support over the last number of months.\"\nTwo public hearings will be held to gather community input before final approval.\nA public hearing will be held on May 7 at 2 p.m. in the Talbot County Courthouse and at 7 p.m. in the Easton Elementary School cafeteria, located at 307 Glenwood Avenue. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The two Republican candidates were represented and found common ground on many issues, but especially for their contempt for incumbent Rep. Andy Harris who did not attend the forum.Republican candidates Chris Bruneau and Michael Scott Lemon, replying to a question, said Harris, who has been in Congress since 2008, initially promised to serve only six terms, for a total of 12 years in the House, but opted to run again in 2022 and is running in the upcoming election.\nDuring the forum, Lemon criticized the Harris campaign for the running of his reelection campaign.\n\"I've not seen the hide nor hair of Andy Harris,\" Lemon said. \"So his strategy is, 'My name is already on there. I'm an incumbent; I'm already going to win.'\"\nWhen asked about the incumbent, Bruneau told a story of how he reached out to Harris about his candidacy because he assumed Harris would not run again. In the same email, Bruneau asked how he could take on Harris' conservative legacy. When Bruneau received a reply from Harris, he said it \"wasn't a nice reply.\"\n\"There's new blood, new people, grassroots guys, he can get down there and make a difference,\" Bruneau said. \"So his term may be limited May 14, 2024, by voting a new candidate ... and start doing some work.\"\nThe Democratic forum, scheduled to run before the Republican forum, was canceled when only candidate Blane Miller showed up. Candidate Blessing Oluwadare did not attend.\nAmong other topics discussed and agreed upon among the Republican candidates was a similar frustration with excessive government spending and the large national debt, term limits for members of Congress, advocating for prioritizing American needs over large amounts of foreign aid spending and a desire to lower taxes while also reducing the deficit though they differed on specific approaches.\nWhen asked about the federal role of abortion, Lemon said it should be left to the states to decide.\nLemon stated that it was a \"difficult issue,\" and by leaving it up to the states, the government allowed the voters to make informed decisions for their area.\nBruneau said that it should be up to the individual to decide whether or not they would like to have an abortion because of how complicated and potentially dangerous it could be to the mother's life and to the fetus's life.\n\"These are decisions individuals need to make. I don't know where the basis comes from for the government to get involved in these things,\" Bruneau said. \"I'm not quite sure it's constitutional for the government to get involved in these things.\"\nIn closing statements, Brueneau said he is not a politician; he is a businessman. He made clear that Harris is a candidate like himself and Lemon and that he should have been at the forum so the voters could consider rehiring him as their representative.\nBruneau accused the Harris campaign of not appearing in the forum because he was leading in the polls. Calls made to the Andy Harris congressional office were referred to his campaign office, but no one answered the phone Monday afternoon.\nIn his closing statement, Lemon said he would give the voters his most authentic, honest version of himself. He emphasized that voters need to make their voices heard on May 14. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

There were three people seeking one of the commissioners' seats representing this town of 1,605. These included Lakia Harris-Pierce, Chad Leister and John Hurley.John Hurley was elected to another term as a commissioner for the Town of Ridgely Monday.\nHurley won a three-way election against Lakia Harris-Pierce, Chad Leister with 69 votes.

He will serve a three year term.\nStephanie Berkey, the town clerk and treasurer said, \"It was a good turnout. It was very nice to see this many turn out for the election. There were lots of younger voters.\"\nHurley has serves as a Ridgely commissioner since 2012.\n\"I feel thankful,\" he said. \"In my 12 years in the town, we have gone from a deficit to a surplus. We have not raised taxes. It was a large turnout for the town. I know it was over 100 people who came out and voted.\"\nLooking forward, he said he is well aware that the tax base of a town of 1,605 is small, and he plans to work to maximize the town's financial security and responsibility.\n\"There is only so much money in the pot to go around. I think we make very good use of our money. We have one of the lower water and sewer rates in the county. I hope to not raise taxes in the future,\" Hurley said.\nAccording to the Town of Ridgely website, \"Ridgely is governed by three Commissioners who are elected to three-year terms. Terms are staggered, so one Commissioner is elected each year in April. Town elections are held on the 4th Monday of April. There are no term limits for Town Commissioners.

Lewis said the town had spent time looking for interested residents, and it found 14 who were \"willing to sign on the dotted line.\"\nThose 14 residents agreed to committing 10% of the cost for their home to be elevated, Lewis said. The other 90% of the cost will be paid by the federal government. Lewis said one of those 14 homes is currently being elevated.\nAlthough she is not yet sure of exactly how this process will go, Lewis said she knows the money will go from the Federal Emergency Management Agency through the Maryland Department of Emergency Management.\nThe town was also awarded $143,000 to go towards the cost of doing these elevations to the town, Lewis said.\n\"Until we get some detail, (we) don't know how that exactly works,\" she said. \"But that was the notice.\"\nLewis said the town hasn't been contacted by anyone from the federal government yet regarding this grant award. She said someone pulled out the line items from the budget and sent it to the town.\nCostigan asked if there is a time limit on elevating the homes and spending the grant money.\nLewis said the government says to spend it in a year, but added that the town requested getting three years to spend the money in its grant request.\nThe second federal grant the town is receiving is for sea level rise adaption efforts. Lewis said $1.06 million will be put toward building the Eastern Shore's capacity \"to plan and mitigate impacts of coastal flooding and tidal inundation.\"\nSpecifically, it will increase the capacity of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's research in addressing sea level rise. Lewis said there will be two scientists at the NOAA lab in Oxford working on this, as well as a liaison specialist for the Town of Oxford and a liaison specialist for the broader Eastern Shore.\nLewis said that this project aims to help other Eastern Shore communities, too.\n\"The idea is to take what we do discover and what we are able to do here and carry it to places that don't have the ability,\" she said.\nCostigan asked if this means Oxford will become the \"epicenter\" of sea level rise studies on the Eastern Shore.\n\"You know, it's $1 million for that purpose alone,\" Lewis responded.\nLewis said this project will also study the town's living shorelines. She is hopeful Oxford will receive a tidal gauge as part of the project.\n\"It is written into this grant, so we have high hopes,\" she said about the tidal gauge.\nLewis is still unsure of exactly how this grant will be handled, but said she assumes the town will need to pay the invoices and get reimbursed by the federal government. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Facts about Frederick Malkus clear, indisputable\n\n April 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BETSY MALKUS | Section: Columns \n \n 1445\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n My father always said that there are two reasons for everything. The reason you give and the real reason.Carl Snowden's timing gives me the real reason for his demanding a name change for the Malkus Bridge. He decided the day the legislative session ended was the perfect time to request action. He knows that the legislature cannot address his complaint until the second Wednesday in January of next year. That gives him over nine months to fundraise before it can be taken up. The Francis Scott Key Bridge's demise would appear to have given him the idea. In non-profit lingo, adding the Malkus Bridge to the Key Bridge looks like a \"two-fer.\"\nThese facts about my father, Sen. Frederick C. Malkus Jr., are clear and indisputable.\nThe 1985 bill he sponsored, mandating the funding for the three Choptank River bridges was passed with 100% approval from the Maryland Legislature. Every single member of the Maryland House and Senate voted in favor, all 188, which included all 24 members of the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus. Snowden's Caucus of African American Leaders of Anne Arundel County is clearly not statewide, and they are not elected officials. Whereas they may have good intentions, their clout doesn't compare to the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus. I do wish them well in other pursuits.\nWhen Gov. Harry Hughes vetoed the bill, it was left to the legislature to override the veto. Hughes, an Eastern Shoreman, had appropriated all transportation tax dollars across the state in order to build two subways at the same time, which no other state had been foolish enough to attempt. As a result, no county outside of the metro areas was able to have any road or bridge repair for 10 years.\nAfter nearly a decade of waiting, my father got frustrated and said, \"If Harry Hughes is going to forget where he came from, then, 'where he came from' is going to forget him. Harry who?\" Hughes had remained furious about the joke, which was believed to be the reason for his political suicide. Vetoing a unanimous bill, at the very least, is an exercise in futility.\nAs the bill processed back through, an amendment was added to name it for my father, to our great surprise. He had absolutely dictated in the beginning that a bridge should not be named for a living person and famously retorted, \"I'm not going to die so that you can make it a memorial bridge.\" He was shocked but honored as the bill passed unanimously a second time.\nDr. Edward Papenfuse, legendary archivist for the state of Maryland, came to my father to say that after a thorough study, he could not find a single other bill that had ever passed unanimously in both houses. This was the only 100% vote in Maryland history. Many of these elected officials, these men and women, had worked with my father for decades.\nCertainly, Mr. Snowden would appreciate how difficult it can be to be elected if you are not representing your entire constituency equally. In my father's case, it was 48 years in the General Assembly. He was the longest serving state legislator in the entire country when he retired.\nI have a photo of my father's retirement and standing next to him, beaming, is Sen. Clarence Blount D-Baltimore City. He was a close personal friend and had been leader of the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus. It was he who had offered to come to Cambridge as a voice of reason during \"the troubles\" in the late 1960s. He and my father walked through the troubled 2nd Ward together, speaking to anyone who would listen. This point is often conveniently forgotten.\nFor during this time, three or four Black businessmen came into my father's law office to request his help. They related that \"Gloria Richardson said that she is coming into town with H. Rap Brown and the Black Panthers. They are going to burn our businesses to the ground and blame the white people.\" These men came to my father because they trusted him. The storeowners hoped to have them arrested, but all that could be done at that time was to notify the governor of a possible riot and call out the National Guard.\nIt was widely reported that H. Rap Brown had said, \"Cambridge needs to explode,\" and he was \"going to burn America down.\" This was no secret. It is known that the fire started at the elementary school for Black children. I could never understand why a group of extreme segregationists would burn that down. Why would they do something that could guarantee that your children would be immediately integrated? The students from the burned school had to go somewhere.\nHistorically speaking, the Reichstag fire concept is more plausible, especially with what my father had learned from local store owners. Burn something important down and blame your political enemies. Worked great for Hitler.\nI cannot claim to have been present during the fire that was set after Gloria Richardson brought arsonists into town, but I certainly saw the aftermath. Those businessmen's livelihoods, indeed, whole blocks of Cambridge were burned to the ground. Fire trucks had been blocked from reaching the conflagration. A policeman had been shot. The result was exactly as predicted. Even as a child, I could see that those businessmen had spoken the truth.\nGloria Richardson then moved out of town, along with most of our factories and industry. Stores relocated to safer places, and they never came back. Our county is still recovering from that economic downfall. Whatever good Ms. Richardson may have done here was eclipsed by her violent exit. For the majority in Cambridge, that riot is her legacy. Mr. Snowden, too, is helping to keep Dorchester from recovering. Words have consequences.\nCertainly, free speech is a pillar of our country's legal system. I served as a paratrooper and then as a Huey pilot along the communist Czech border supporting the 1st Armored Division as my contribution to free speech. Arson isn't a form of free expression any more than slander is. I believe I have earned my right to have my say on both.\nSnowden's complaints quote 1963, when I was 4 years old. I cannot speak to that. The other things I lived through in 1967, including all of the violent vitriol that caused me to be shoved around the elementary school cloakroom and my brother to be beaten up, were personal.\nI remember one night when my mother told me to take my younger brother and sister and hide, locking ourselves in an upstairs interior closet. Four vigilantes had come into our yard, miles out of town. They were drunk, had guns and they called my father out. I remember waiting in the dark for a gunshot. I can't help but remember that.\nAs far as I'm concerned, the only part of Gloria Richardson's time in Cambridge that I know about personally was her role as a domestic terrorist. If Mr. Snowden wants the local population to know more about her, I assure you, those burned-out families know all they need to know.\nThose calling for the Malkus Bridge to be named anything else are suggesting they know better than those actually elected by the constituency of the entire state. They believe they are smarter than his peers, who worked with my father to make the state better for all. To disparage him in this way is not only disrespectful to his memory but also to everyone who voted for him or for his bridge bill.\nI find Mr. Snowden is being disrespectful to every member of the 1985 Maryland Legislature.\nMy father never needed the credit, which is why so many respected him. He wouldn't want to be called a hero, but his people and his peers found him worthy. He stuck around to work to repair what Ms. Richardson, H. Rap Brown and the Black Panthers had destroyed. One of his last projects was to have the Hyatt built on the shores of the Choptank. Up to the end, he worked to bring jobs to his district.\nAs he retired, Senate President Mike Miller created an award for my father that he believed truly described his demonstrated public service across nearly five decades. The First Citizen Award plaque can be found at the old Senate office building interior entrance. \"To be a First Citizen is to be a dedicated and effective participant in the process of making government work for the benefit of all.\"\nWhen it came to naming that bridge, that's the real reason.\nGloria Richardson chose to burn her bridges in Cambridge; Fred Malkus labored to build them back. You be the judge.\nBetsy Malkus is the daughter of Frederick C. Malkus Jr. She lives in Cambridge. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trappe Council introduces ordinance to raise water and sewer usage fees\n\n May 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 381\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TRAPPE — On Tuesday evening, the Trappe Council introduced an ordinance to raise water and sewer usage fees.The introduction of Ordinance 3-2024 would amend section 14 of the Trappe Town Code to increase the water and sewer monthly fees for usage.\nThe monthly water usage rate is $4.70 per 1,000 gallons, and it's being proposed that it go to $6.20 per 1,000. The monthly sewer usage rate is currently $10.98 per 1,000, and it is proposed that it go to $11.48 per 1,000.\nThe base fees would not be increased, but the usage fees would be. Commissioner Brian Schmidt, council president, said that though the council does not like to increase fees, the town is in \"desperate\" need of it.\nSchmidt said Trappe currently has three pumping stations that need repair, which would cost roughly $3 million. He also added that Trappe has a $13 million wastewater treatment plant that also needs repairs.\n\"While we hate to increase rates, the financial stability of the town is kind of in need of it,\" Schmidt said.\nAdditionally, the council approved introducing Ordinance 2-2024, adopting the FY2025 budget. This budget established a property tax rate of 33 cents per $100 of assessed real property value and 75 cents per $100 on commercial or business, personal property or public utility.\nIt also established an annual fee of $182 per residential household for trash collection service and adopted an enterprise budget for the town's water and sewer operations.\nErin Braband, Trappe administrator, pointed out that the tax rate for assessed real property and business personal property is not increasing, and the trash rate is not increasing.\nFinally, the council approved the transfer of wastewater allocation from six lots in the Lakeside at Trappe development to the community pool for Lakeside residents.\nLakeside has purchased 120 units and issued 114 permits for homes to be built. The remaining six lots will go toward the community pool.\n\"We're transferring the sewer allocation from those six lots to the community center lots, so there's sewer allocation for the restrooms in the community center,\" Attorney Ryan Showalter said. \"And this agreement basically says we're not going to build houses on those lots for occupancy, we're not gonna open anything for occupancy until the new treatment plant is open.\"\nThe council unanimously approved the agreement for wastewater allocation and development restrictions. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Both have attempted to bolster their claims with the words of other partisans, or with (partisan) experts, or with \"studies,\" which are, all too often, less than objective.\nIn that regard, many actually fail an objective smell test.\nSo, what is a voter to do, you ask. My advise, should you choose to listen, is to listen to both, no all, sides, if possible. There are likely kernels of truth in things they say, emphasis on kernels. However, kernels do not the whole cob make.\nBe skeptical of partisans, they likely have agendas that may not serve the interests of communities at large well. Why is that important, you ask. After all, don't we want the kind of government that best serves our own personal interests and of those with similar interests? Isn't that what political parties are all about? Perhaps, but I would argue, that should not be what they should be all about.\nAs a member of the post World War II baby boomer generation I grew up during a period of time when fathers worked and mothers stayed home to nurtured the family. When neighbors talked to one another, took care of one another and gave consideration of how what they did would affect others in their communities. That is more difficult now, for any number of reasons, but do we really want to walk away from community responsibilities? Is that in our own best interests? I would argue, no.\nWhy is that? Because, in my opinion, we all do better, when we all do better. Life and communities are not zero sum games. There are prices to be paid when we do better, at the expense of others. It's basic civics.\nWILLIAM C. KEPPEN\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Caroline County commissioners discuss FY 2025 budget, years ahead\n\n May 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 878\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — On May 7 the Caroline County Commissioners convened to present the fiscal year 2025 budget, but the budget discussion looked at what's to come in years ahead.Discussions featured two prominent, long-term issues — the county's revenue-generating landfill and the state-mandated Blueprint for Education program.\nThe budget overview also covered the operating budget, capital budgets, proposed tax rates and municipal real property tax differential rates.\nLooking forward, Commissioner Larry Porter said The Mid-Shore II Regional Landfill will generate $420,000 a year in revenue if it stays in Caroline County.\nIn the late 1980s, due to new federal regulations, the counties had to close their landfills and replace them with new landfills. In response to this new regulation, Talbot, Caroline and Queen Anne's counties engaged with MES to form a partnership where each county would take turns hosting a landfill for a 20-year term. Kent County later joined that partnership.\nCaroline County is hosting the current landfill and, under the original arrangement, would be off the hook at the end of 2030 when Queen Anne's County would take over the responsibility of host. However, the partnering counties have agreed to allow the landfill to stay in Caroline County for 12 years longer than initially planned.\nDan Fox, deputy administrator, said the county will receive a revenue increase of around $12.3 million over the duration of the extended agreement at a meeting held earlier on May 7. The counties agreed on a $3 per ton post fee until 2030. In 2031 it will rise to $6.\n\"Landfill is a revenue benefit to the county. Down the road, we will need this money,\" Porter said.\nThe other topic discussed by commissioners was the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a massive educational program that includes salary increases for teachers and more funding for early education.\nThe commissioners are concerned about its expense to the county.\nWhile dramatically boosting state funding for public education over a decade, the Blueprint also asks local school districts — and taxpayers — to do their part.\nIn a letter to Gov. Wes Moore, the Maryland Association of Counties last November listed a litany of concerns. They said the Blueprint's cost estimates don't take into account the bottom-line local impact of several major spending items, including construction costs for additional classrooms needed under the plan's expansion of pre-K and the new minimum $60,000 teacher salary starting in 2026.\n\"It is a bad program and we have to figure out a way to pay for this,\" Porter said.\nEducation-related expenses made up the top expenditure for Caroline County in FY 2025. The Board of Education will receive about $17.1 million if the proposed budget is approved, about $2.3 million more than last year.\nRounding out the top four expenditures are the sheriff ($5,534,994), corrections ($5,889,769) and emergency medical services ($5,563,069).\nThe top three revenue generators for fiscal year 2025 are property taxes ($28,704,000), income taxes ($20,200,000) and a disparity grant from the state ($4,686,791).\nThough commissioners voted to maintain the same tax rates as last year, the county will bring in more revenue from property taxes in FY 2025 due to an increase in the assessed value of properties in Caroline County.\nBecause of this increase, the state will provide less funding to the county in its annual disparity grant.\nAccording to the Maryland Department of Legislative Services, the disparity grant is \"where the local income tax is below 75% of the statewide average. Under the program each eligible jurisdiction receives a grant that enables the per capita local income tax revenues to reach 75% of the statewide average.\"\nDeputy Administrator Dan Fox said that our state disparity grant is being funded at $615,525 less than last year.\n\"That is a state-driven formula that is based off of wealth. We changed in percentage there, which means we receive less money this year,\" Fox said.\nThe tax differential rate was discussed for various municipalities.\nPorter described the tax differential as \"revenue that the county does not collect. It is not money being taken from the towns or given to the towns. It does not affect town budgets in any way. It is money that the town does not collect.\"\nFox said, \"The county is looking to maintain the property tax rate at 98 cents per 100 of all unincorporated areas as well as the towns that do not receive a differential,\" he said.\n\"This year we are looking provide Denton with the same tax rate as the prior year with 92 cents- a six cents differential to get you to 92 cent county tax rate. Federalsburg will have a county tax rate of 90 cents. Greensboro will remain at 92 cents. Preston would receive and remain at 97 cents and Ridgely would be at 93 cents,\" said Fox.\nCommissioner Frank Bartz said they go through the budget line by line. And although there were some conversations, by and large they agreed on each item.\nTwo people Sue Simmons, interim director of Caroline County Arts Council and Dr. Cliff Coppersmith, President of Chesapeake College, both came up and stated how grateful they were for the county's support.\nThey had scheduled an hour and a half for this meeting, but it only took around 45 minutes. One commissioner, Travis Breeding, was \"under the weather\" and did not attend live.\nThe FY 2025 budget is scheduled for potential adoption during the Commissioners of Caroline County meeting on May 28. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Lewis explained, face recognition, data syphoning and micro targeting are all algorithms AI uses to collect and generate information.\nAI is already being used to suppress votes, strengthen division and create narratives and realistic fake news, he said.\nPredicting 2024 will see more voters in polls across the world than any other point in history, and noting \"You can't spell campaign without AI,\" Lewis believes AI will only continue to grow during the election periods and give way to periods of false information spreading raapidly.\n\"The scary part of AI is how realistic it can appear,\" he said.\nCrucial pillars for the path forward include information literacy, informed citizenry, civic learning and personal and political virtue, according to Lewis.\n\"Moral finger wagging\" is an essential aspect of a functioning democracy and areas of \"news deserts\" with little to no local media coverage are particularly vulnerable and susceptible to misinformation, according to Lewis.\n\"Reliable information is often behind a paywall while bad information is often free,\" he noted.\nHowever, as fast as AI is adapting, so is the world.\nThrough \"information inoculation,\" students are learning to be more proactive and less vulnerable to false information and media manipulation, Lewis said.\nThe Gunston School has set a multi-year goal to evaluate and upgrade its approach to civic learning and civic education to help students better understand AI, he said.\nLewis teaches Advanced Placement U.S. Government and has adapted his homework assignments to combat AI's ability to write term papers, he said.\nAlthough scary and uncertain, like the internet, AI has opened doors into new perspectives and benefits including modern medicine.\nLewis strongly advocated for always researching before sharing information.\n\"The takeaway is how powerful this really is,\" he said.\nWhile future technology may be less than uncertain, the dedication of organizations like the League of Women Voters keep democracy alive and thriving in an informed community, according to Lewis.\nThe League of Women Voters is a non-partisan organization that works to encourage informed and active participation in government and works to increase understanding of national, state and local public policy through education and advocacy.\nCurrently 60 members strong, the League is active in community voter services including voter registration events and printing voter guides.\nIn addition to the presentation and meeting, the League offered guides on voting and governmental officials.\nPresident Liz Hammond encouraged everyone to spread the word of the crucial importance of voting and making a difference in democracy.\n\"It is disheartening whenever we hear from people who say they don't vote,\" Hammond said.\nMore information including a quarterly newsletter can be found at lwvqac.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There is also an additional requirement that no licensed dispensary may be located within 100 feet of an area zoned for residential use.\nThese changes were made to comply with legislation that changed what is considered unduly burdensome for cannabis regulations compared to alcohol regulations.\nThe planning commission voted to approve their recommendation with the given changes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Board President Angie Hengst called Zeidman's knowledge and experience invaluable.\n\"We're grateful for his service to the community through his place on the CWDI board these past six years,\" she said.\nCWDI Board Secretary-Treasurer Frank Narr said Zeidman's skills, contacts and guidance led the organization through the \"critical\" initial development phase.\nThe announcement of Zeidman's resignation comes just nine days after CWDI alleged in a court motion that Cambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout sent a letter to Zeidman in October requesting his resignation from the CWDI board.\nRideout declined to comment on Zeidman's resignation.\nThe motion, filed May 14, is in response to a lawsuit filed by the Commissioners of Cambridge in early May against CWDI, CWDI Holdings and Yacht Maintenance Company regarding a 2021 property transfer agreement between CWDI and the city.\nAccording to the motion, CWDI alleges, \"When Mr. Zeidman did not resign in response to this request, the city promptly introduced an ordinance regarding appointment and removal of individuals to represent the city on the governing boards of non-profit organizations ...\"\nThe proposed city ordinance, which was tabled indefinitely on Feb. 12, would have given the city the authority to appoint an individual to represent the city on a non-city governed board; and also remove that individual, and subsequently impose a fine or jail time if the individual continued to act as a representative of the city on said board. In a Jan. 2 letter from CWDI Executive Director Matt Leonard to Rideout, Leonard asked the city to abandon the ordinance altogether.\nOn April 16, Rideout held a meeting where he proposed amendments to CWDI's Articles of Incorporation in an effort to get the relationship between CWDI and the City of Cambridge \"back on track.\" One of his proposed amendments would explicitly give the city, county and state the authority to remove and replace their appointees to the board at any time.\nAlthough Rideout had planned to sign or further amend his proposed amendments to CWDI's Articles of Incorporation on Thursday, he postponed the signing following an agreement between CWDI and the city to enter into mediation.\nAccording to CWDI's May 23 news release, the city has been notified of Zeidman's resignation.\n\"We look forward to working with city leadership on filling the resulting vacancy through the processes described in our bylaws,\" Leonard said. \"And we are optimistic that we can have a productive and successful mediation with the city next week.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Larry Hogan walked the aisles of Simmons Center Market in Cambridge Wednesday afternoon, perusing meats and cheeses and checking out the old the antique cash registers that lined the top row of one of the market's shelves.Walking with him were market owner and Dorchester County Councilman Ricky Travers and County Council Vice President Mike Detmer. Both Travers, a Democrat, and Detmer, a Republican, endorsed Hogan from their respective sides of the aisle for the state's open U.S. Senate seat that day.\nHogan, who won the Republican primary for the seat earlier this month, will face Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks in the general election in November.\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat, Hogan called being endorsed by both Democrat and Republican members of the County Council \"a special moment.\"\n\"This is especially nice because it's a bipartisan thing,\" he said. \"I've always been somebody that reaches across the aisle and tries to find consensus and tries to get things done with Republicans and Democrats working together.\"\nDetmer said in an interview that on the County Council, he and Travers work together to find the \"practical, pragmatic, best path forward\" for Dorchester County residents.\n\"And I think (the endorsements) reflect that Councilman Travers and I both see Gov. Hogan as the pragmatic, practical choice to send to the Senate,\" he said.\nFor Travers, it's not about Democrat or Republican when it comes to the senate seat.\n\"It's about who's the best person for the job,\" he said in an interview. \"That's the bottom line.\"\nTravers said he is endorsing Hogan because of Hogan's track record as governor.\n\"He did a great job for us when he was governor,\" Travers said. \"(I) had a great working relationship with him. And he was very amenable to working with rural Maryland.\"\nHogan said that when he was governor, he kept his promise of paying more attention to the Eastern Shore than the governors before him did.\n\"We work so well with all of the county and the municipal governments all over the Shore,\" he said.\nAlthough Robin Ficker received the most votes in Dorchester County in the U.S. Senate Republican primary earlier this month, Hogan said that doesn't matter.\n\"We want to do whatever we can to convince them that this is an important election,\" he said about Dorchester County residents. \"And it doesn't matter what they did during the primary, we need their vote in the general election.\"\nHogan said his campaign has a lot of support in Dorchester County.\n\"And I'm expecting we're going to win this really big in November,\" he said.\nSimmons Center Market was just one of the stops on Hogan's visit to the Eastern Shore on Wednesday. Hogan started the day at Patriot Point in Madison and then stopped at the Woolford Store before heading to Cambridge to visit the market.\nNext up, Hogan said he was headed to Ocean City to meet with the Ocean City Career Firefighter Paramedics Association and the Worcester County Professional Firefighters. In the evening, he said he had plans to deliver a speech at Stephen Decatur High School's graduation ceremony. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gov. Wes Moore, a friend of Maryland newspapers\n\n June 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM JOHNSON jjohnson@chespub.com | Section: Columns \n \n 669\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Gov. Wes Moore recently vetoed a Maryland House bill that would have been crippling to state newspapers.\"There is also a vital public interest in ensuring the existence of thriving independent local media,\" Moore wrote in his veto letter. \"In fact, democracy can not function effectively in the absence of a free press that provides objective information to the citizenry about crucial events in government and in our communities.\"\nThe legislation, House Bill 1258, would have taken public notices regarding estate administration, currently published in newspapers, and allowed them to be posted on a state-operated website. The cost to state newspapers was estimated at $1.7 million. If the legislation had taken effect Oct. 1, there is no doubt that by the dawn of the new year would have seen significantly fewer newspaper journalists working in Maryland.\nIn his veto letter, Moore noted public notice advertising \"have helped sustain much of the local print media in Maryland' as advertising dollars have dried up and the media industry has consolidated and downsized.\nMoore had some tough words for the newspaper industry, whose lobbying group did not engage in hearings, testimony or conversations about the bill. That was a serious oversight by the Maryland-Delaware-D.C. Press Association, an oversight that could have had disastrous effects on the newspapers that pay dues for the association to represent them in legislative discussions. Moore, without a doubt, bailed out newspapers with his veto.\nSticking on the theme of state politics, the race to replace U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin started hot and continues to sizzle. Democrat Cardin decided not to seek reelection, which set off a ferocious primary battle between Congressman David Throne and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks. Despite being outspent 9-1 by Trone who dumped tens of millions of his own money into his campaign, Alsobrooks easily won the nomination.\nAlsobrooks will face former Gov. Larry Hogan in November. Hogan is hoping to appeal to Democrats to cross over and vote for him as they did when he was elected governor. Hogan started the morning after the primary, releasing a video showing prominent Democrats praising him during his days when he was governor. The video featured clips of Wes Moore, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and even Angela Alsobrooks. The message: Hogan has a history of working across the aisle with Democrats.\nThat message was on display last week when Hogan visited Cambridge where he picked up a couple of endorsements from Dorchester County Councilman Ricky Travers, a Democrat, and County Council Vice President Mike Detmer, a Republican.\n\"This is especially nice because it's a bipartisan thing,\" Hogan told Star Democrat reporter Maggie Trovato. \"I've always been somebody that reaches across the aisle and tries to find consensus and tries to get things done with Republicans and Democrats working together.\"\nFor Travers, it's not about Democrat or Republican when it comes to the Senate seat.\n\"It's about who's the best person for the job,\" he said in an interview. \"That's the bottom line.\"\nHogan drew fire from his own party after he posted on Twitter prior to a New York jury finding former President Donald Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with hush-money payments during the 2016 campaign to cover up an affair with adult film actress, Stormy Daniels.\n\"Regardless of the result, I urge all Americans to respect the verdict and the legal process,\" he posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"… We must reaffirm what has made this nation great: the rule of law.\"\nThat drew criticism from Republicans.\n\"You just ended your campaign,\" Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to Trump's presidential campaign, responded minutes later.\nBuckle your seatbelts, we are in for a wild ride with this campaign.\nCongratulations to Talbot County Council member Keasha Haythe who became a grandmother on March 17 with the birth of Declan James Alexander Haythe. Declan is the son of Marcus Leandre Haythe Jr. and Beatrice Anne Gorman. Keasha Haythe beams when she talks about her grandson.\nJim Johnson is the executive editor of the Star Democrat. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gunsallus scrutinized for Easton Pride flag comments\n\n June 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 840\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A packed chamber at Easton's June 3 Town Council meeting spoke out against Council President Frank Gunsallus for his remarks during a meeting last month concerning Pride flags and the LGBTQ+ community.At the May 20 meeting, Gunsallus said that the Pride flag is \"antithetical to America\" and questioned whether the town should use funds to support such flags and banners.\n\"I believe that it is a socialist endeavor parading beyond or behind the guise of a social movement,\" Gunsallus said May 20. \"And I think that we should not be using taxpayer funds to support a cause that is antithetical to our country and our principles and our Constitution.\"\nMany residents addressed those comments directly during Monday's Town Council.\n\"Council President Gunsallus, you, sir, have done the citizens of Easton a great service by revealing your personal bigotry,\" Easton resident Elizabeth Parks said. \"We know not to vote for you ever. To say that LGBTQ people are antithetical to what America stands for, is to say that you would deny them the right to be who they are.\"\nParks and subsequent residents received loud applause for their words during the public comment section.\n\"The comments made at the previous meeting showed that the LGBTQ members of the Easton community cannot trust the council,\" resident Lauren Fierman said. \"... Why are you pushing back so much on the LGBTQ community when Easton enthusiastically supports Juneteenth, Waterfowl Festival, St. Patrick's Day parades?\"\n\"I do not believe that the leadership of the council was interested in saving money,\" resident Kelley Moran said. \"I believe that the interest of the council leadership was in looking at a way to remove the Pride flags.\"\nResident Shari Wilcoxon was one of a few residents who spoke in support of the council president.\n\"This is not a topic about gay people. That's not what I heard,\" Wilcoxon said. \"The topic that I heard was about fiscal responsibility of this Town Council. ... I'm thankful that (Gunsallus) is diligently looking out for the financial well-being of Easton.\"\nAfter a lengthy public comment section, Gunsallus addressed his remarks from the previous meeting.\n\"I'd like to clear the air — the absolute truth is that I firmly believe all people are equal and should be treated as such,\" he said. \"This is why I support every member of our community. While aiming to be cognizant of the challenges they face, as an elected official, I must be fiscally responsible and use hard-earned taxpayer dollars to support the town's operational needs. And that was the focus of my comments from the last meeting. I apologize if my intent was not clear.\"\nIn January, the council tackled a similar topic, with Gunsallus and Ward 3 Council Member David Montgomery voting against a public assembly permit for the Delmarva Pride Center's annual Pride festival, held June 13 to 16.\nMONTGOMERY COMMENTS\nMontgomery supported Gunsallus' statements about the flags May 20 and doubled down Monday evening.\n\"We were discussing first an issue about the town displaying Pride flags,\" Montgomery said. \"…I do not believe it is the town's business to make everyone feel good about their identity.\"\nMontgomery continued, stating the country is being \"torn apart by identity politics.\" He went on to call out the transgender community's involvement in the LGBTQ+ movement specifically, which was met with boos and some attendees leaving the chamber.\n\"This is about the hijacking of the movement by a transexual ideology,\" he said.\n\"This country's being torn apart because of people like you,\" one attendee said out loud. Others called Montgomery \"pathetic.\"\n\"I've listened to everyone here and I've noticed that every one of you misstated what Frank and I were talking about,\" Montgomery said, referencing the May 20 comments. \"What I stated was that there is a danger to our community from promotion of this transexual ideology.\n\"...This town has no business putting up flags that promote the notion that you will feel better, you will solve your teenage problems if you decide that you should go out and demand your sex be changed,\" he continued. \"That's what I object to, nothing about any individual.\"\nOTHER COUNCIL COMMENTS\nFollowing Tuesday's public comments, Ward 1 council member Maureen Curry stated her support for the residents and the LGBTQ+ community, with Ward 2 council member Don Abbatiello echoing her stance.\n\"I am fully supportive of the LGBTQ community and the Delmarva Pride Center, and I'm looking forward to celebrating with you this month,\" Curry said. \"Words do matter. ... I'm on your side.\"\nWard 4 council member the Rev. Elmer Davis Jr. stated to the council and audience: \"We should learn to love everybody. We're not all going to agree on things.\"\nPrior to public comment, Easton Mayor Megan Cook denounced Gunsallus' original comments before the council, which was met with applause from a number of attendees.\n\"I feel those comments were dangerous, and they do foster a climate of intolerance and exclusion,\" Cook said. \"Asserting that the Pride flag or support of our LGBTQ community is antithetical to our country or our Constitution is incorrect.\n\"When such divisive comments are made, it begins to tear at the fabric of our town.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In the survey, it states that \"with community support, there may be an opportunity for the Town of Easton to acquire this property\" from the county.\nZimmerman, who has a background in business development and has lived in Easton for six years, feels this is a chance for community members to \"lead on an issue rather than react to something later.\"\n\"The survey gives the community members a voice in the decision making process,\" Zimmerman said. \"It'll also help the public officials understand community priorities.\"\nThe survey includes a list of multiple-choice questions measuring respondents' thoughts on potential uses for the space, such as a community pocket park, housing and small business startups. It also has open feedback questions for residents to fill out.\nThus far, Zimmerman has noticed many responses indicating residents would support a new community center, a multi-use park or a courtyard with small shops.Throughout his time in Easton, he also has noticed that the public's opinions are not always known, adding that the survey can \"create a conduit between residents and public officials.\"\n\"When I have attended some of the meetings, I'm always wondering, 'What does the majority of the population feel about this?' Zimmerman said. \"I don't know. And I don't really know if the town officials know either.\"\nThe property, which is owned by the county, is still operational and will be through most of June. County Manager Clay Stamp said the council will discuss the future prospects of the building and surrounding land \"in the coming months.\"\n\"It's going to be a process that the County Council goes through,\" Stamp said. \"I'm sure it's going to be a fairly open process. I'm sure they're going to be interested in getting input … That's going to be on their agenda in the coming months.\"\nStamp said the primary focus will be on moving the department into its new building, which will better house the department that has outgrown its current location.\n\"We're laser-focused on trying to get them into their new building, where they'll be able to better serve the community,\" Stamp said.\nTalbot County Health Department spokesperson Justin Beall said a ribbon-cutting is set for the end of this month. The department's goal is to re-open at the new location by early July.\nResults of the survey will be presented to Easton Town Council and Talbot County Council once county discussions concerning the property begin, according to Zimmerman. However, the survey will remain open for the foreseeable future to gather \"as many responses as possible.\"\n\"We're not advocating for a specific outcome or on behalf of any interest group,\" Zimmerman said. \"This is a grassroots effort to promote a process that encourages public input. Tell us what you think and we'll help amplify the collective voice of the community.\"\nResidents can fill out the survey by emailing {span}eastoncommunitysurveys@gmail.com and filling out the anonymous form. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton budget projects more than $100K saved in overtime pay\n\n June 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 604\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In what was a difficult process, Easton officials worked all spring to finalize the $28 million fiscal year 2025 budget, which included a sizable decrease in overtime pay, an area of much discussion in previous council meetings.According to figures provided by Town Manager Donald Richardson, the town is budgeted to save $127,250 in overtime pay to employees in FY25.\nThe decrease comes after Mayor Megan Cook reworked the budget, which was approved at a June 3 Town Council meeting, to switch the status of 13 department heads from non-exempt to exempt. Exempt employees do not receive overtime pay.\n\"It was a lot of negotiation, because it's not an easy transition,\" Ward 1 Council Member Maureen Curry said. \"But in my opinion, it was the right thing to do.\"\nWhile $430,320 was budgeted for overtime in FY24, Richardson said the current expenditures are about $498,000 as the July 1 fiscal year end approaches. FY25's budget allots $303,070 for overtime pay.\nNotably, there is no overtime budgeted in FY25 for the town manager, building inspections and engineering departments. Those three areas combined for a total of more than $90,000 in projected overtime in FY24's budget, with engineering coming in second-highest overall at $72,000.\nThe highest department in overtime budgeting was police patrol, which will decrease from $256,700 in FY24 to a projected $209,000 in FY25, still the highest amount.\nIT, police administration and parks and recreation will all receive overtime decreases compared to last year's budget. Police special operations, meanwhile, is budgeted for an increase of more than $25,000 in FY25 overtime pay.\n\"Shifting select administrative staff to exempt status has reduced overtime costs and aims to prevent potential budget overruns,\" Council President Frank Gunsallus wrote in a statement. \"... I commend everyone involved in this budget process for their hard work to ensure financial responsibility and transparency.\"\nThe Town Council held a workshop in April to discuss shifting department heads to exempt status. Cook presented a plan of action, including a 3% salary increase for those moving to exempt status to offset the losses in overtime pay.\nCouncil members expressed concern with this increase during the workshop, and those increases were reduced by the time the final budget was passed early June.\nIn June 7 interviews with the Star Democrat, Curry and Ward 2 Council Member Don Abbatiello both praised the mayor for working to reduce those increases during the budget process.\n\"She came back, and many of those increases that we thought were a little excessive were reduced by the mayor to make it a little bit more palatable for the council to accept,\" Abbatiello said.\nCook and Chief Human Resource Officer Rick Farr vouched during the April workshop that this was a much-needed change for the town. While council members largely agreed, it took some tinkering and adjustments.\nAbbatiello is pleased with the status change for select employees and sees it continuing for years to come.\n\"We're talking about department heads,\" Abbatiello said. \"We're not talking about the guys who work outside in public works. We're not talking about the office staff.\"\nWhile Abbatiello and Curry each expressed satisfaction with this year's budget, next year's will be no easy task.\nBoth mentioned that federal funds from the American Rescue Plan Act will run dry. Abbatiello noted the council must keep its eye on the balance of the budget's allocation toward salaries and benefits versus capital projects\n\"You do not want salaries and benefits far (exceeding) operations and capital projects, because then you're not going to get anything accomplished around town,\" he said.\n\"Next year is going to be even more of a challenge,\" Curry said. \"And some belt-tightening may be in order.\"\nMaggie Trovato contributed reporting to this story. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Two candidates run for Oxford commission seat\n\n June 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 665\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — Two candidates will vie for the open Commissioners of Oxford seat in the town's election on June 18.Candidates Norm Bell and Josh Coder are running to fill the seat of Commissioner Susan Delean-Botkin's, whose term is expiring. Delean-Botkin, who did not seek re-election, was appointed to the commission seat in June 2023 following the resignation of former Commissioner Brian Wells.\nThe person elected to the position will serve a three-year term. On June 18, between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Oxford voters can head to the Oxford Community Services Building at 101 Market St. to cast their vote.\nNORMAN BELLOxford resident Norman Bell, 79, is retired from a 45-year career at DuPont. He has municipal government experience through volunteerism, including being chair of the Oxford Planning Commission, president of the Oxford Community Center, chair of the Oxford Hiring Procedures Ad Hoc Committee, and member of the Sea Level Rise and Stormwater Steering Team. Bell has a wife, Paula, two sons and two granddaughters.\nWhy are you running?\n\"We need to calm the divisive atmosphere that is keeping us from moving forward. The people of Oxford have a history of working together to make significant accomplishments. I believe that every resident wants to continue this history of success. I have developed a skillset, through my professional and volunteer experiences, that can help to make this happen. I want to partner with the people of Oxford, in whom I believe, to plan and build for a successful future.\"\nWhat will you bring to the commission?\n\"I began volunteering in Oxford after moving here 12 years ago. I have experience working with town government committees and nonprofit organizations. During my 45-year career with DuPont, I developed skills managing teams, and the ability to encourage people to work toward consensus. I found these skills very helpful in my work as chair of the Oxford Planning Commission, president of the Oxford Community Center, chair of the Oxford Hiring Practices Policy Committee, and as a member of the Sea Level Rise and Stormwater Steering Team. Those responsibilities required full time commitment. As commissioner, I will be equally devoted to my responsibilities.\"\nWhat would you say is the most pressing issue facing Oxford and how do you think the commissioners need to address it?\n\"As of July 1 , five of the 11 town employees, including hopefully a new town manager, will have less than six months of experience as Oxford town employees. This is the most pressing short-term issue. Our attention to the professional development of these new employees will ensure the continuation of services to our residents. Our most long-term pressing issue is sea level rise. The commissioners need to address it by empowering citizens to be engaged in helping to find solutions.\"\nDo you feel that the town and commissioners have done a good job of addressing sea level rise and flooding in Oxford? Why or why not?\n\"The town has been addressing the flooding issue. A comprehensive flood plan was developed, priorities set and grant funding obtained. Detailed engineering studies, necessary to begin the actual design and implementation work, were just approved. Could it have been done in a more expeditious manner? Starting the work depended upon grant funding availability.\nSea level rise is a longer-term issue. As a good first step, the town commissioned a study to assess the future impact of sea level rise on Oxford and its residents. The next step is to empower already engaged citizens in helping to find solutions to this long-term issue. I am a part of the steering team, which is developing that process.\"\nJOSHUA CODERCoder is a Oxford volunteer firefighter and EMT. According to his campaign website, Joshua Coder has a degree in international affairs and economics and a master's degree in geology. His website says he has experience with permitting, environmental compliance, construction, water management, managing budgets and managing audit documentation and financial disclosures. It says he is an Army veteran.\nCoder declined to respond to the Star Democrat's questions and instead directed the newspaper to his website. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore spent Friday afternoon on the Eastern Shore, meeting with local officials as well as nonprofit and agricultural leaders.\"It's great being back here, it's the 18th time that we've been on the Shore since I've been the governor,\" Moore said. \"... I believe deeply that if this is going to be Maryland's decade, it means that the Shore must also be able to live up to all of its promise.\"\nHe made his first stop at the Caroline County Sheriff's Office for a tour of the facility that opened in 2021. Sheriff Donald Baker showed the governor everything from the department's inventory of supplies to its men and women working daily to protect residents.\n\"We absolutely treat our citizens the way they should be treated,\" Baker said to the governor.\nThe two talked about low homicide rates in Caroline County, collaboration between neighboring police and the task of policing in such a large state where policies are different county-by-county. Moore asked about the county's approach to other forms of policing and community safety.\n\"We definitely believe in community policing,\" the sheriff said.\nMoore took the short ride from Denton to Ridgely to visit Martin's House & Barn, a homeless shelter that provides a food pantry and thrift shop for those in need.\nHe met with staff and board members of the organization, lauding the work they do for the homeless population.\n\"We've prioritized everything from funding going toward the Shore, health care … but also organizations like this one that are doing remarkable work,\" Moore said.\nMoore donned a baseball cap for his final stop of the day at Twin Maple Farm in Ridgely. Dave Tribbett Jr. introduced the governor to his team and the farm's planting of miscanthus grass, an environmentally friendly product that can be used for bedding in chicken houses and the creation of biodegradable to-go containers.\nVisibly impressed by the environmental benefits of miscanthus grass, Moore asked about building infrastructure to process the grass, as well as the challenges of growing it.\nThe governor didn't mind getting up close, walking through the farm's fields and getting a close look at the water filtration system and the ground beneath the crops.\nRepresentatives and members from the Maryland Department of Agriculture, Mountaire Farms and USDA were present for Moore's last stop. Travis Hedrick, CEO of North Carolina-based AGgrow Tech, provided Moore insight into the benefits of miscanthus.\nHedrick said miscanthus is especially great for small farmers since it doesn't require equipment to replant it every year. There are around 3,000 acres of the crop on the Shore, he said.\nIf sent to other farms in the area, Hedrick and others emphasized it could create a mini-industry of growing and processing jobs.\n\"You had me at jobs,\" Moore said.\nBefore his three-stop tour, Moore's team held a cabinet meeting with the Caroline County commissioners.\n\"I just told the commissioners — and as they've seen — our belief in them and our commitment to their success is real and this is an administration that believes deeply in making sure the Shore succeeds,\" Moore said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Elmer Davis. \"You three will be remembered for opening this door,\" he said, adding that other groups may now have the ability to obtain festival permits.\nShari Wilcoxon, who wrote to the council in the winter asking for the festival to be held on West Street instead of South Harrison Street, called Monday evening for the council to be \"apolitical.\"\n\"Would you fully support … a Moms for Liberty parade?\" Wilcoxon asked. \"Would you pay for banners?\"\nMONTGOMERY COMMENTS\nMeanwhile, other meeting attendees addressed Montgomery's comments from the June 3 meeting, which included a claim of \"danger to our community from promotion of (the) transexual ideology.\"\n\"By saying that Pride, the Pride flag or any section of our LGBT community is merely an ideology overlooks what the essence of Pride is: a celebration of human rights and the recognition of inherent dignity of all individuals regardless of their (sexual) orientation or gender identity,\" Mayor Megan Cook said at the outset of Monday's meeting.\nMontgomery responded, saying he \"did not appreciate being chastised\" by Cook. The mayor said they will likely not ever \"see eye-to-eye on social issues,\" but that she hopes everyone can keep an \"open mind.\"\n\"What I'm trying to do is to be helpful to those who are being misled by what I think is clearly an ideology, and it's demonstrated by the way my comments were received last month,\" Montgomery said. \"Shouting someone down in an effort of de-platforming simply proves we are dealing with an ideology and a political movement.\"\nJen Wagner, a St. Michaels resident who owns a business in Easton, took to the podium to call for the resignation of Gunsallus and Montgomery, to which the Town Council president said \"that's too far.\"\n\"I will not prolong this debate tonight on facts or their interpretation,\" Montgomery said at the meeting's end. \"I will object to personal attacks, which exclusively came from the audience directed in this direction.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Proposed housing development at former Safeway site reaches town council\n\n June 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A proposed 33-unit housing development at the site of a former Safeway was presented to Easton Town Council Monday evening and met with both praise and questions surrounding its design.The proposal comes from Lane Engineering on behalf of NAI Saturn Eastern and Safeway, which still owns the property, along with Miller Development Corporation, the potential developers of the project.\nThe property, which has been vacant since 2017, sits at 139 N Washington St.\nRyan Showalter, an attorney representing Miller Development, said that designs were presented and passed by the town's planning and historic district commissions.\n\"I think it's fair to say that the Historic District Commission members were very complimentary and appreciative of the level of design and detail,\" Showalter said Monday.\nLane Engineering planner Brett Ewing and project architect Maurice Walters showed the council renderings and sketches of the units and surroundings.\nEach unit has two parking spaces — most of them in garages — and access to an open walkway in the center of the homes, renderings showed. There are 24 townhomes connected in the middle of the lot, with nine standalone units.\n\"It is an outstanding, outstanding project,\" Ward 1 Council Member Maureen Curry said. \"I'm excited it's in my ward. Thank you for choosing Easton. That's the plus side.\"\nCONCERNS DISCUSSED\nMultiple drawbacks of the project, however, were discussed by the council and the applicants. Parking was one of those concerns, with Ward 4 Council Member the Rev. Elmer Davis suggesting developers purchase additional parking across the street in a public lot.\n\"I know that you have two parking spaces, but I don't think that's enough parking if you have visitors,\" Davis said. \" … I'd like to see you purchase some of those public parking spaces so that we can assure that you have overflow parking in your proposal today.\"\nCurry said the council has a \"bigger problem with parking\" than just this one potential development, to which Ward 3 Council Member David Montgomery agreed, calling the two spaces per unit mark \"pretty generous.\"\n\"Twenty years ago, I was sitting in the same seat, talking about the same thing, that we need parking downtown,\" Curry said. \"But now it's critical. I would hate to not have a project like this because we haven't done our due diligence on creating parking downtown.\"\nDavis and Ward 2 Council Member Don Abbatiello each expressed worries about open space at the property. General planned unit development proposals require at least 30% of a development area be open space, but Miller Development's proposal falls under the town's PUD infill subdistrict.\n\"Open Space shall be that which is deemed adequate by the Town Council,\" the town's code states for PUD infill projects.\nDavis and Abbatiello suggested that the council consider requiring the developers to make financial contributions to open space areas downtown, affordable housing projects or parks and recreation.\nEwing said he and his team will review parking possibilities and additional contributions. Robert Miller, principal of Miller Development, told the council that \"there is a point where we push too far\" in terms of finances.\n\"We are threading some really close needles on this project. I want to be upfront with that,\" Miller said.\nCouncil President Frank Gunsallus said public comment would remain open at the next meeting on July 1.\nNO GROCERY STORE\nWhile the site of the former Safeway has been unoccupied for nearly seven years, hopes from residents for another grocery store remain. Showalter told the council that those hopes will not come to fruition.\nHe referenced Safeway's parent company, Albertsons, also owning subsidiary ACME, located on Marlboro Avenue in Easton. Albertsons also merged with Kroger, which owns subsidiary Harris Teeter across Route 322 from ACME.\n\"It's become abundantly clear that there's no circumstance in which Safeway will sell this property in a manner that allows it to be occupied or redeveloped as a grocery use,\" Showalter said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Organizations that have received property exemptions in the past include Cambridge Commons, Cedar Meadows Rod and Gun Club, and Home for Hurlock.\nTax exemptions make it so that individuals or organizations do not have to pay a tax due to certain qualifications. For example, a charitable organization can apply to be exempt from property taxes through the state.\nCounty Attorney Chip MacLeod acknowledged the history of these exemptions but said the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation has certain requirements when it comes to qualifying for property tax exemptions.\n\"When I hear a gun club LLP, I'm trying to think of how that's going to fit into a property tax exemption,\" he said.\nMacLeod said the county needs to do its due diligence, and he said there is a cost to the county when it comes to offering exemptions.\n\"Every one of these exemptions is less revenue,\" he said.\nRevenue is particularly important for the county as it inches closer to fiscal year 2025. In late May, the council passed its fiscal year 2025 budget, acknowledging the difficulties of getting it to the finish line. At the May 28 meeting where they passed the budget, Council President Lenny Pfeffer said they \"made it by the skin of our teeth\" in balancing the budget.\nAlong with voting to have MacLeod review historically approved property tax exemptions at the June 18 meeting, the council voted to send a letter to those organizations to let them know their exempt status is under review. Tolley said these letters will most likely be sent out before the property tax bills are sent out.\nTolley also told the council to keep in mind that these organizations that have been exempt have not been billed for a long period of time.\n\"So you're likely to hear that when they receive the bill,\" she said. \"You will hear that concern from these organizations.\"\nMacLeod said that having these property owners come in to ask for a rebate is better for the county than offering a blanket exemption.\n\"I just want a little more time to look at this,\" he said about the list of historically property tax-exempt organizations. \"And I think it's in the council's interest to know what the universe of these exemptions (is) and really understand them one by one.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Without fair elections we have no true democratic process.It is the law of the state of Maryland that both political parties have equal representation by election judges for the primary and general elections in all precincts. It has come to the attention of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee that the law is not being upheld.\nNot only do Democrats make up the majority of election judges at several precincts, many Talbot County Republicans are complaining to the Central Committee that they were either turned down in their applications to the Board of Elections or else never called.\nThe people who have notified the committee, saying they have been rejected, are American citizens and registered voters who have no reason to be disqualified from service on Election Day.\nAn Easton woman and registered Republican wrote: \"I applied to be an election judge in April 2024. I took the online training and passed. I am still waiting….\"\nOne non-Democrat woman in Royal Oak was informed in March that all positions were filled but that she could be a stand-by judge if she wanted. This is odd because some citizens we know who have applied and been accepted to be election judges have said that more judges were desperately needed.\nAccording to Wikipedia, as of March 2024, there were 11,631 registered Republicans and 10,543 registered Democrats in Talbot County. But the statistics offered by the Talbot County Board of Elections as of April 2024 show that there are 54 Republican judges and 62 Democrats.\nThis number should be equal.\nWhile the needs of various precincts no doubt differ one from another due to varying populations, it is still unacceptable for there to be more Democrat than Republican election judges when we know many Republicans who have applied for the job.\nWe hope that the balance of election judges is made more equitable in all precincts by November.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Choptank fishing pier plans still TBD\n\n June 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 737\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — The Maryland Department of Natural Resources is continuing to determine the best place for a new fishing pier on the Choptank River between Talbot and Dorchester counties.The search for a location began in 2021 with closure of the Bill Burton Fishing Pier.\nGregg Bortz, media relations manager for DNR, said in an email that the department is working with both counties, as well as the City of Cambridge, to find \"the best option for access\" to the Choptank. He said the department is considering a few sites that are \"in the general vicinity of the current pier.\"\nBortz said after this process is complete, DNR plans to move forward with creating that access.\nIn late December 2021, the fishing pier was closed due to structural safety concerns. A February 2022 underwater inspection revealed crumbling concrete in multiple areas of the structure below the water's surface.\nAlthough Joe Brooks — who lives a few houses down the road from the Dorchester County side of the fishing pier, on Radiance Drive — was sad to see the fishing pier close, he was happy that it would put an end to the trash in his front yard and illegal parking on the street.\n\"It was just out of control for many years,\" he said. \"Everyday you get up and walk and pick up trash out in the front yard. ... And it's all kinds of trash.\"\nBrooks helped petition the City of Cambridge to get no parking signs put up on the street, but he said there were people who parked there anyway.\n\"There's not adequate parking for a fishing pier there,\" Brooks said about where pier's former location. \"I mean, there's a very small parking lot for the use of the pier.\"\nAs DNR looks for the best spot for a new fishing pier, Brooks thinks it should go somewhere other than where it currently is. He said the Talbot County side of the river has many acres of land with ample space for parking. Brooks said if the fishing pier must go on the Dorchester County side, the county Visitor Center is on the other side of U.S. Route 50, and would make more sense as the pier's location.\n\"It's not trying to fit a square peg in a round hole,\" he said.\nParking and accessibility are primary concerns for DNR when it comes to deciding on a location for a new pier, Bortz said.\nBrooks said he doesn't know anyone else in the neighborhood who wants a new fishing pier to be built in its current location.\n\"Pretty well everyone in my area had issues with parking and sometimes (dis)respectful people on the pier,\" he said.\nAmerican Legion Post 91 Commander-elect and former Maryland Sen. Rich Colburn said he estimates there is room for 12 cars in the parking lot for the closed fishing pier. He said a new fishing pier on the other side of Route 50 or on the Talbot County side would have more room for parking.\nThe American Legion Post, which is directly across the street from the closed fishing pier on Radiance Drive, has been interested in leasing the fishing pier parking lot from DNR since the pier closed. In a May 24 letter, DNR Secretary Josh Kurtz told Colburn in response to the reuqest that DNR was unable to lease the parking area at that time.\nBortz said the lot is not for sale because it could be part of the department's plans for future park access. Colburn said he understands DNR will need the parking lot when it demolishes the current pier, but until that happens, he believes DNR could easily lease the lot to the American Legion.\nMid-Shore Fishing Club President Tom Wilkison thinks the closed pier should be replaced with a new one in the same location.\n\"Because the community needs it,\" he said. \"There are so many people that used to use that pier, especially from the Cambridge side.\"\nWilkison, who has never fished off the pier but has walked on it, said the current location of the pier is accessible. He acknowledged it could use a little more parking on the Dorchester side.\n\"I just hope that the state puts something back there,\" he said.\nBrooks said when DNR does construct a new fishing pier, it's important that it also maintains and polices the pier.\n\"That's the best way to keep people — in my mind — respectful, is have a respected place and have a presence of people to enforce that,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He stated that the Pride flag was \"antithetical to America\" and that he believes \"that it is a socialist endeavor parading beyond or behind the guise of a socialist movement, and I think that we should not be using taxpayer funds to support a cause that is antithetical (in stark contrast to) our country and our principles and our Constitution.\"\nMr. Montgomery voiced support, and so do I and the majority of people I am acquainted with. I've been been appalled at the negative responses of the LBGTQ community and their supporters since this happened and the vitriol which Mr. Gunsallus has been subjected to from this loud and angry societal fringe of people who supposedly stand for freedom.\nI am a proud white, English-American, evangelical Christian, heterosexual, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, nurse, teacher and fervent American patriot. But I do not feel the need to publicly celebrate with flags celebrating any of these titles. The American flag covers them all, including the LGBTQs of the country, and is all that is needed to fly in the cities, towns and villages of our country as it stands for freedom for all.\nUnfortunately this fringe community has a goal of determination to legitimize and normalize their deviant lifestyle choices by forcing those with differing beliefs, especially those based on biblical standards, not only to validate but to celebrate these choices. They represent less than 20% of the population, yet they insist that diversity, equity and inclusion requires everyone to not only agree with them but celebrate them and their aggressive agenda.\nMr. Gunsallus is like the boy who recognized that \"the emperor has no clothes\" pointing out the absurdity of this agenda which only serves to divide us. He and Mr. Montgomery should be applauded for their boldness and not allow themselves to be overcome by the noise.\nThere is a quiet majority of concerned citizens behind them.\nLINDA HOUCHENS\nSt. Michaels \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hearn Building project moves toward construction with pivot\n\n July 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 715\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Green Street Housing is adapting its design plans for the Hearn Building project on Race Street following concerns from Cambridge Planning and Zoning commissioners over ground-floor residential units.After a June 4 Planning and Zoning Commission meeting where Green Street — an affordable housing developer — presented its concept site plan for review, Cambridge City Attorney Patrick Thomas determined that placing apartment units on the ground floor of the the Hearn Building does not comply with the city's Unified Development Code.\n\"So we will be adapting our plans accordingly to prepare for resubmission to the planning commission,\" Green Street Director of Development Chase Powell said in an interview.\nGreen Street hopes to have an updated concept site plan for the commission to review in time for the commission's August meeting, Powell said.\nAt the June 4 meeting, Powell presented his company's plans for 505 and 509 Race Street — a roughly 50,000-square-foot mixed-use development that would include 44 residential units and 4,000 square feet of commercial, office or retail space fronting Race Street.\nPowell said Green Street is financing the project using funding through the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development's Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program and the department's loan resources.\n\"And with that comes a high commitment to designed quality and energy-efficiency,\" he said at the meeting.\nCurrently, there are two buildings on the land that Green Street plans to develop. Powell said they plan to raze 505 Race Street and build a new building in its footprint. For the Hearn Building at 509 Race Street, he said Green Street essentially plans to build a building within it.\n\"The Hearn Building is a shell, more or less, with a roof,\" he said. \"So what we are proposing is what I would say, just a phenomenal feat of engineering to put a structure within a structure.\"\nDuring the meeting, Commission Vice Chair William Craig brought up Green Street's plan to put apartment units on the ground level, behind commercial space. He cited a section in the city's Unified Development Code that states residential uses should be located on the upper floors of buildings in the \"core\" subdistrict, which the property is in.\nCraig also pointed to the permitted uses table, which does not permit commercial apartments on the ground floor of a building located in the core subdistrict.\n\"That's what the ordinance says,\" he said. \"And so I don't know how you're going to make it comply with that with this residential on the first floor.\"\nThomas said he hadn't looked into this before the meeting, but agreed with Craig's interpretation of the code.\nNEXT STEPS\nIn an interview, Powell said since the city's determination that there cannot be residential units on the ground floor of the property, Green Street's architect is in the process of reconfiguring the plans to retain as many units as possible.\nAlthough Powell suspects they will not be able to keep all 44 units in the property plans, he thinks the project will still be financially viable.\nCambridge City Planner Holly Baldwin said Green Street will need to to come back to the Planning and Zoning Commission again with the project's preliminary site plan. Once the commission has approved the plan, Green Street will have to submit its final construction plans for review and approval by city engineering and the city's zoning official, Baldwin said.\nPowell said Green Street has had to do a lot of work to help people understand Green Street's intentions with this project.\nIn October, Cambridge Commissioner Brian Roche sent a letter to Maryland Secretary of Housing and Community Development Jake Day requesting a revision to the Hearn Building project plans. Roche said the current plan would further concentrate poverty in an area without an excess of available jobs, would go against Cambridge's Neighborhood Revitalization Plan and its Comprehensive Plan goals and would be an \"excessive\" cost to taxpayers, among other things. Roche also brought up a concern for management issues down the line.\nAt the meeting on June 4, Powell said TM Associates Management, which manages Cambridge apartment New Horizons, will be managing the Hearn Building apartments once the project is complete. He said there shouldn't be concerns about poor management because Green Street is a local developer.\n\"So we're very driven to make sure that everything's being maintained and it's orderly,\" he said. \"Because it's in my backyard, too.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lengthy public comment examines council’s stance on Pride\n\n July 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 904\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — For the third consecutive meeting, Easton residents filled town council chambers to express opinions on council rhetoric regarding last month's Delmarva Pride Festival, Pride banners and the LGBTQ+ community.Council President Frank Gunsallus originally came under scrutiny for comments made at a May 20 council meeting. At that meeting, he said the Pride flag was \"antithetical to America\" and questioned whether town funds should support downtown Pride banners.\nRichard Potter, the president of Talbot County's NAACP branch, told Gunsallus on Monday that his office will send the council vice president a letter requesting a meeting this week.\n\"We found the rhetoric from this council troublesome,\" Potter said. \"We found the information resembling that of the Jim Crow era.\"\n\"That rhetoric when I heard it, coming from members of the council, it was disturbing,\" resident Rudy Reyes said Monday. \"I did feel unsafe.\n\"I'm also scared. I think a lot of people, especially after the May 20 meeting, are scared. A lot of people don't want to come up here in front of the council to address some of the things that were said.\"\nThe June 3 meeting was the first of three highly-attended meetings in which residents pushed back on Gunsallus' comments. That is also when Ward 3 Council Member David Montgomery claimed there is a present \"danger to our community from promotion of (the) transexual ideology.\"\nAt the subsequent June 17 meeting, Mayor Megan Cook, along with many residents, denounced Montgomery's comments.\nOn Monday, numerous residents spoke in support of Montgomery.\n\"I feel that we have devolved into a me against you and you against me,\" resident Anne Cerutti said. \" … I saw nothing wrong with what Mr. Gunsallus and Mr. Montgomery had said.\"\nResident Judi Esola thanked Montgomery and Gunsallus for \"being free.\" \"I think we're afraid of being conservative,\" Esola added.\nMontgomery said Monday's meeting was \"a much more congenial atmosphere\" than the June 17 meeting, in which one resident called on him and Gunsallus to resign.\n\"I appreciate those who have spoken on both sides, but in particular hearing the emphasis that these are opinions, these are points of view,\" Montgomery said.\nFESTIVAL PERMIT\nIn January, Gunsallus and Montgomery each voted against a permit for this year's third annual Delmarva Pride Festival in downtown Easton. Kyle O'Donnell, chair of the Delmarva Pride Center, told council members Monday that he has filed for a public assembly permit for 2025.\nHe said the center is committed to continuing the \"family-friendly event,\" adding that he would like to see the council return to the unanimous, bipartisan support for the permit it had in 2022 and 2023.\n\"If you cannot bring yourself to vote yes for this public assembly permit, to vote yes for freedom, consider casting a respectful abstention,\" O'Donnell said.\nResidents on both sides spoke out during the public comment section.\n\"Nobody needs to go after our children,\" resident Catherine Nobles said. \"We do not need them coached, we do not need them groomed, we do not need them telling their parents that they have no rights to what they want to do.\"\n\"I saw so many happy families, happy children,\" resident Brandi Whiting said of the festival. \" … What I didn't see was scantily clad people, I didn't see people grooming anybody. … I saw businesses making money … and I saw dollar signs.\"\nBIAS COMPLAINT\nAt the start of Monday's meeting, Gunsallus read aloud a statement from Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble regarding a hate bias complaint filed last month.\nTina Jones, a board member of the Delmarva Pride Center, filed the complaint June 7 to the attorney general's office in light of the previous council comments. The attorney general's office then directed her to reach out to Talbot County law enforcement.\nShe said she called the Talbot County Sheriff's Office to report the bias incident.\nJones told The Star Democrat that her main goal is to have open dialogue with council. Although Jones said she spoke with Gunsallus following a June meeting, she said neither Montgomery nor Gunsallus have reached out to her privately to discuss the matter.\n\"I'm trying to have a dialogue,\" Jones said. \"And I have offered that up every time I've spoken.\"\nThe statement from Gamble said that after reviewing Easton Town Council video footage, the Talbot County State's Attorney's Office and the Office of the State Prosecutor determined that there was no hate crime committed at the meeting.\n\"However, since the Maryland law required police departments to take reports for bias incidents, our office generated a report and the incident was documented,\" the statement said. \"This is not a criminal investigation.\"\nGamble told The Star Democrat he contacted the attorney general's office to obtain a legal definition for a hate bias incident, to which the office said there is no legal definition.\n\"My office does not weigh in on whether a bias incident occurred since there is no legal definition on what exactly a bias incident is,\" Gamble's statement read by Gunsallus said. \"The Maryland legislature passed the law in 2019 requiring Maryland law enforcement to take these reports but failed miserably to give legal guidance.\"\nJones attended Monday's meeting but did not speak during public comment as she has in previous meetings.\n\"Clearly, I feel like I have a target on my back,\" Jones said. \"It would've been very difficult for me to get up there last night and state on the record ... what my home address is. There's a level of fear.\"\nThis report has been updated to further clarify the history of discussions between Jones and Gunsallus. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It comes after residents expressed concerns about excessive noise coming from the Tidewater Inn on Dover Street.Ordinance 823 states that \"amplified music from commercial establishments\" is not allowed from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Council members voted unanimously to approve the legislation after a short discussion.\nResident Helen Houseman lives on Goldsborough Street right behind the hotel and wedding business. She explained her concerns to council members Monday.\n\"I'd only moved in for a couple of months when the Tidewater hosted a wedding,\" Houseman said. \"And that music was so loud that I couldn't hear my TV. I could make out every single lyric that was playing.\n\"It's all about the decibels. It is so incredibly loud … When they host an event in that tent, it is so irresponsibly loud that it's profoundly affecting my quality of life.\"\nEnid McKitrick, Houseman's neighbor, agreed.\n\"It wasn't just the noise, it was the vibrations in the walls,\" McKitrick said. \"It felt as if there was a band in my bedroom. It was so loud.\"\nResident Brandi Whiting felt the 10 p.m. cutoff was a bit early.\n\"I think cutting it off at 10 is a little drastic if you want to keep bringing in young people into this town,\" Whiting said. \"There's not a lot to do after 9, not a lot to do after 8.\"\nThe ordinance defines amplified music as \"any music that is played outside of enclosed structures and is amplified through speakers or other electronic means.\" It also states that if doors or windows are open for an \"extended period,\" then music from indoors will be considered outdoor music and thus be prohibited.\n\"I do think that Tidewater and any other business should be good neighbors,\" Ward 4 Council Member the Rev. Elmer Davis said. \"If they're having something outside, they should talk to the neighbors and make them aware of what's going on. It's about being neighborly.\"\nCouncil President Frank Gunsallus noted that the ordinance does include the option for businesses to procure a permit to play outdoor music during the restricted hours. The ordinance also exempts \"music played for government-sponsored events and ceremonies.\"\nThe ordinance will go into effect 20 days following approval from Easton Mayor Megan Cook. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Council left the public hearing open for an Aug. 5 meeting.\nROUTE 50 ANNEXATION\nEast of U.S. Route 50 and between the Royal Farms and Unitarian Universalist Fellowship at Easton, Corrigan & Trippe Ventures is proposing the annexation of county land for an estimated 240-unit housing project.\n\"Is it ideal to have another 240 cars entering Route 50 where it is already heavily congested?\" Easton resident Becky Allen asked. \"Do we really want people walking on the shoulder of Route 50?\"\nAllen, who lives right next to the property, said she still has not heard from developers, even after council previously suggested reaching out to nearby residents. Other residents also indicated worries about traffic and walkability.\n\"I don't see that we have any benefits to this other than we're packing them in,\" Connie Knopp said. \"We know what benefits it is to the developer, the realtor and the lawyer. They get the benefits.\"\nCorrigan & Trippe's attorney was out of town Monday, deferring a potential vote to July 15.\nAFFORDABLE HOUSING\nA lack of affordable housing was a common theme from residents who spoke Monday.\n\"I love this town, but I can't live here,\" Rudy Reyes said. \"I can't afford to live here.\"\n\"There is none,\" resident Charlotte Brown said of affordable housing. \"Especially for the seniors. You have senior citizens that are sitting on waiting lists for ten years to get a spot in a place that they can afford.\"\nStephanie Chester, who currently resides in Trappe, brought up her concerns to council members and the Affordable Housing Board at a meeting on Tuesday.\n\"The infrastructure of Easton is changing,\" Chester said Monday evening. \"But I don't see people of middle class or lower class getting anywhere. They're not getting houses.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

In February, Diaz underwent a liver transplant. He said in an interview that resigning from the board was something he had been thinking of since becoming sick.\nMorgan, who was vice president of the board, resigned June 14. She resigned one day after a contentious Board of Education vote to terminate the district's contract with Vision Quest, an alternative education program for district high schoolers that has been met with criticism from residents since it was approved in September.\nIn an interview, Morgan said the vote was not the only reason she decided to resign. \"My decision,\" she said, \"(came) when I saw the direction the people appointed by the County Council — not elected by the people — have chosen to take.\"\nAt the council meeting on July 2, Detmer talked about his experience attending council and board leadership meetings with Diaz, Morgan and Pfeffer.\n\"I think that in that ground-level experience, I really got to see both of their heart and passion for kids,\" he said.\nIn those meetings, Morgan and Diaz would \"pour their hearts out,\" Detmer said.\n\"I really value the way that both of them worked to try to get to what they believe was right for the children of this county and then for the staff members of this county,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It comes since Easton is in its sixth year in the municipal separate storm sewer system program.\nWhen the ordinance was first presented at a June 17 town council meeting, council members questioned if power washing would be feasible with the regulations.\n\"It doesn't mean that you can't power wash,\" Van Emburgh said Monday. \"It just means that you need to use the best management practices to contain the runoff.\n\"If you're power washing the side of a house and it goes into the grass, and it doesn't leave the yard, that's okay. We're looking for water that leaves the property (and) gets out onto the street.\"\nVan Emburgh said placing mats in a driveway is an example of how to prevent power washing chemicals from going into the street.\nThe ordinance does include exemptions, such as residential car washing, irrigation water and dechlorinated swimming pool discharges that fall in line with MDE regulations. Car wash businesses are not included in the exemption list.\n\"So a commercial car wash has to recycle their water,\" Van Emburgh said. \"The ones that I know of do that, they recycle their water.\"\nMultiple council members brought up concerns about the ordinance.\n\"I'm quite concerned, because I think the community needs to know about this legislation and what they can and cannot do,\" Ward 4 Council Member the Rev. Elmer Davis said. \" … I'm not quite sure the community understands this document holistically. There has to be some more public relations regarding these changes.\"\n\"My concern is, what is Public Works going to do once we pass this?\" Ward 2 Council Member Don Abbatiello said, referencing the work the town does to spray weeds. Van Emburgh responded that \"it does seem on the surface that that's something we have to change,\" adding that he would look into that concern.\nVan Emburgh said the town was in \"no rush\" to approve the illicit discharge ordinance during Monday's meeting. Ward 1 Council Member Maureen Curry said she was not ready to vote on the ordinance. Ward 3 Council Member David Montgomery said he was \"perfectly happy with it the way it is,\" but was content deferring to others who have outstanding questions.\nThe council elected not to vote on the ordinance Monday, leaving the public hearing section open for the next council meeting on July 15.\n\"There are some violations occurring around town that we're aware of,\" Van Emburgh said. \"We want to have the law to be able to enforce that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Council approves agreement for transfer of Lakeside plant\n\n July 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 583\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TRAPPE — Ahead of Trappe taking ownership of the Lakeside Wastewater Treatment Plant, the Trappe Town Council unanimously approved an agreement for the transfer of responsibility between the town and the developer.This is a significant step in the process of Trappe obtaining responsibility over the Lakeside plant, which will serve the Lakeside at Trappe housing development.\nThroughout the council's July 3 meeting, questions were asked by council members and residents, common themes among which were concern for the future and making sure that every effort was made to protect the town.\nTown attorney Lyndsey Ryan, the council and Lakeside engineer Robert Rauch took time during the meeting to break down the responsibilities of the developer and the town in the transfer contract.\nDEVELOPER'S RESPONSIBILITIESUntil the transfer of responsibility is finished, the developer is required to pay all operational costs directly and reimburse the town for any town operational costs associated with the wastewater plant.\nThe developer is required to assign to the town all guarantees and warranties provided by contractor, equipment ownership and a maintenance bond for a period of three years. A maintenance bond is purchased by a contractor to protect the property owner from the costs to remedy a completed construction project's defects.\nThe bond will cover 100% of construction cost to the town. Prior to Trappe approving any subdivision, plat or site plan approval for subsequent phase of the Lakeside development, there will be the bond to provide funds.\nIncluded in funds provided by the developer, the developer will have to establish a capital reserve fund, which would go towards capital operation, maintenance and replacement costs in the wastewater treatment plant until the town assumes sole responsibility for the operation.\n\"The developer is going to remain responsible for payment of any deficiencies between the actual operation and maintenance costs of the wastewater treatment plant and the user fees collected by the town,\" Ryan said.\nWHEN TRANSFER IS COMPLETE Once Trappe has full responsibility for the plant, the developer is required to establish an escrow account, a contractual arrangement in which a third party receives and disburses money.\nThis account has to have five times the max deficiency payment during the six months preceding the date the town takes over. That amount must remain within the escrow account until the plant is self-sufficient.\nIn case of any deficiency in the plant, the developer is required to open another escrow account to cover the deficiency.\nAdditionally, there is a provision in the contract that if the developer would like to construct a second wastewater treatment plant to serve the development, they would be required to upgrade Trappe's existing plant to provide capacity to any remaining properties within Lakeside. This way, the Trappe wastewater plant will be prepared to take on any additional capacity needed.\n\"At the end of the day, it's just covering your basis so that the town never has to put out money for Lakeside, their development, their wastewater treatment facility and anything that partakes in that,\" Council member Jeremy Newnam said.\nFINAL STATEMENTSToward the end of the meeting, Rauch gave an update on the plant. Rauch said the plant is \"exceeding all expectations.\"\nThrough questions asked throughout the meeting, residents and council members alike wanted to ensure the town's protection from any future changes the plant may have.\n\"You can't plan forever for everything,\" Rauch said. \"But you can protect the town forever for everything through this agreement, and the effort was made to make sure that there's no question that the town is not going to be exposed to any financial issues.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Last summer, the city contracted with The Traffic Group to complete a downtown traffic study, according to the memo. In December, the City Council voted to temporarily — pending feedback — replace the traffic lights with stop signs at certain intersections.\nSince February, the city has replaced six intersections with stop signs over three phases. Those intersections are:\nSpring Street and Gay Street.Muir Street and Race Street.Muse Street and Gay Street.\nHigh Street and Glasgow Street.\nHigh Street and Locust Street.\nGay Street and Poplar Street and Race Street.\nAt the City Council meeting on July 8, acting City Manager David Deutsch said the city found no negatives associated with the study. He said there wasn't an increase in traffic accidents, and neither the city nor police department received \"feedback of any significant nature.\"\nIn the memo, Jackson said the city received both positive and negative feedback about a week after each phase of the project was completed.\nAt a City Council meeting in March, Cornelia Turner expressed concerns about the switch from stop lights to stop signs.\n\"It's a mess,\" she said at the meeting. \"I've almost been rear-ended.\"\nJackson said that since all three phases were completed in mid-April, the city has received little to no feedback on switch to signs.\nWith City Council's approval, Deutsch said the city would get started on taking down the traffic lights as quickly as possible. It will cost the city about $4,000 to remove the traffic lights and poles. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Open Meetings Compliance Board finds Cambridge City Council in violation\n\n July 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — The Maryland Open Meetings Compliance Board has found the Cambridge City Council to be in violation of the Open Meetings Act for actions made during and following a City Council meeting on Jan. 8At a City Council meeting on July 8, Cambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout read a portion of the board's July 3 opinion, which found that the council violated documentation requirements for a closed meeting preceding the open session council meeting in January.\n\"The city does not fully agree with this decision, but has read it as required by the Open Meetings Act board,\" he said before directing city staff to publish the opinion on the city's website.\nAccording to the opinion, which was published on the Maryland attorney general website, the board found the city failed to prepare a written closing statement to enter into a closed session meeting, failed to put together \"sufficiently detailed\" minutes of the closed session and failed to put together a \"sufficiently detailed\" public summary of the closed session.\nThe board did not find that the council violated the Open Meetings Act by holding the meeting itself.\nThe opinion states the complainant filed an application in September requesting the city rezone several parcels of land. It says the council was scheduled to vote on the matter on Jan. 8, and at the beginning of that meeting, the council voted to postpone the vote on the application.\nAccording to the Jan. 8 council agenda and meeting minutes, the council voted to postpone one item that dealt with rezoning: an ordinance that would have amended zoning to make four contiguous parcels at the corner of Washington and High streets the same zoning district.\nAt a council meeting on April 22, the council voted to deny the proposed ordinance, which had previously been tabled, in a three-to-two vote, with commissioners Jameson Harrington and Brian Roche voting against denying the rezoning.\nJim Chaney, complainant and managing member of Quality Housing Cambridge LLC — which submitted the application to rezone parcels on Washington and High streets — said he thought the Compliance Board did the best it could with the information it was able to obtain.\nChaney said it was concerning that the city did not keep \"proper minutes\" for the closed session meeting. He said that he didn't believe in the city's leadership.\n\"How do you attract businesses and people to come to the city when you're doing things like this?\" he asked.\nAccording to the opinion from the Compliance Board, the complaint alleged that the council:\nEntered into closed session without convening the meeting in open session.Had discussions in closed session outside the parameters of what it said it would discuss.Failed to make required disclosures to the public after exiting closed session.Conducted business outside of a meeting that should have been conducted in an open meeting.\nThe complaint also alleged that the council violated the act by tabling the ordinance during the Jan. 8 open session meeting.\nThe Compliance Board said it could not conclude whether the council \"improperly convened\" in closed session Jan. 8 after the town said it made a public announcement before doing so.\nThe board said that although the council invoked two exceptions that allow it to enter into closed session, the council did not prepare a written closing statement, which is a violation of the act.\nThe board also said it could not determine whether the council talked about things outside the bounds of what it claimed to enter closed session for because the council failed to disclose anything regarding the substance of the closed meeting in its sealed minutes. The board found the council in violation of the Open Meetings Act because of that failure.\nRegarding the allegation that the council conducted business it should not have outside of the meeting, the board said the question is really a matter of whether the council met in secret because the act only applies to meetings. The board said the council denies discussing the application before the regular meeting, and the board could not conclude whether the council met in secret.\nThe board said tabling an item is not a violation of the act and declined to find a violation based on that specific allegation brought forward by the complainant. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The first time community members get to share ideas is usually when the development is in front of the town council, and by then essential parts of the plan are difficult to change, he said.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook, Easton Town Council President Frank Gunsallus, members of the Easton Affordable Housing committee, area residents and representatives of the Mid-Shore Board of Realtors were in attendance Wednesday.\nWheedleton said as an Eastern Shore native, he felt proud to help bring people together to share their ideas for this property.\n\"We understand how important this site is for this town and for the East End neighborhood in general and for the greater community, which is why we're here today,\" he said.\nTwo mixed-use developments will be built on the former Perdue grain facility on Brookletts Avenue. The developments will provide affordable housing opportunities and commercial space for the town, the developer said in a May 28 statement.\nThe project's developer is Chesapeake Community Development, a subsidiary of The Arc focused on creating equitable, accessible and inclusive committees, according to the Chesapeake Community Development website.\nAttendees at the Wednesday meeting sat in groups of seven and answered questions about the development's future.\nThe questions included:\nWhat are key residential elements needed for the community?What challenges do you see for the property?What would success look like for the development?\nEvery table had large post-it notes for attendees to write down their ideas. Once they moved on to the next question, the meeting leaders would come by each table, take the large note and stick it to the walls for all to see.\nAs the meeting progressed, attendees shared their hopes and concerns, including wanting active commercial use of the property, playgrounds, proper security and accessible buildings.\nCarolyn Jaffe, an advocate for the East End Association, shared her concerns about parking with her table.\n\"We had a lot of discussion about the difficulty with the streets that surround (the site). The site itself has three very narrow streets,\" Jaffe said. \"They're not expandable … So you've got parking, you've got traffic, which is already a problem. There's a lot to swallow in that.\"\nOther attendees requested restaurants, open space for residents, and a diverse mix of residents from different incomes, ages and ethnicities.\nJonathon Rondeau, president and CEO of The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, said this event was essential to the organization, and he was happy to see a mix of excitement and some well-founded concern.\n\"Any development that we're doing, whether it's housing or mixed development, is reflective of the communities we serve,\" Rondeau said. \"Before we are fully done with the development process of designing the space. We wanted to hear what the community wants to see as part of that so we can make sure that it's integrated into the plans.\"\nWhen closing out the meeting, Wheedleton urged everyone to continue to share their ideas through an online feedback form at ccdmaryland.org.\nA second community meeting will be hosted in September, with details to be announced soon, according to Wheedleton. That meeting will feature information and plans based on the comments from Wednesday's meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It goes into effect July 21.\nAustin Smale, general manager of the Tiger Lily restaurant on North Washington Street, said it will affect how his business accommodates live musicians.\n\"We might not be able to support the same acts we have in the past, with larger-sized bands as well,\" Smale said. \"And then night entertainment with DJs or any type of musician will be indoors now.\"\nWhile Smale said the restaurant's entertainment is secondary to its food and drinks, he emphasized that live entertainment has brought in both locals and tourists, even from out of state.\nThe ordinance defines amplified music as \"any music that is played outside of enclosed structures and is amplified through speakers or other electronic means.\" It also states that if doors or windows are open for an \"extended period,\" then music from indoors will be considered as outdoor music and thus be prohibited.\nBusinesses can apply to Town Council for a permit to play amplified music beyond the permitted hours. \"Government-sponsored events or ceremonies\" are exempt from the rule.\nWard 2 Council Member Don Abbatiello said the council received many complaints from residents about noise levels around 11 p.m. and midnight.\n\"I'm a firm believer if you buy a house next to a bar, you know what you're getting into,\" Abbatiello said in an interview. \"But these weren't complaints from somebody who was across the street. These were complaints from people who were blocks away, and they were still hearing it late into the night.\"\nThe 10 p.m. mark was chosen since it falls in line with county regulations, Abbatiello said.\nThe Town Council held a brief discussion last week prior to voting on the ordinance. Two residents that live on Goldsborough Street spoke during the public hearing to express frustration with noise coming from the nearby Tidewater Inn.\n\"I'd only moved in for a couple of months when the Tidewater hosted a wedding,\" resident Helen Houseman told the council. \"And that music was so loud that I couldn't hear my TV. … When they host an event in that tent, it is so irresponsibly loud that it's profoundly affecting my quality of life.\"\n\"I do think that Tidewater and any other business should be good neighbors,\" Ward 4 Council Member the Rev. Elmer Davis said at the meeting. \"If they're having something outside, they should talk to the neighbors and make them aware of what's going on. It's about being neighborly.\"\nSome residents, though, expressed frustration with the ordinance under a Facebook post by the town on Thursday.\nOne commenter, Quinn Parsley, is a musician who has played at Tiger Lily before. He's worried the new law will have a negative impact on both local businesses and the town's music scene.\n\"It's already pretty tricky to do much live music in Easton,\" Parsley said in an interview with the Star Democrat. \"Especially considering how supportive of the arts Easton makes itself out to be, doing something like this, this doesn't do anything to help any musicians.\"\nDon Reedy, director of operations at the Tidewater Inn, said in rare instances, weddings request to use the outdoor tent area on the property. He said the Tidewater Inn will cut off those gatherings at 10 p.m. moving forward compared to what had been a 10:30 p.m. cutoff.\nReedy's main frustration stems from a lack of communication with the town.\nIn an interview, Reedy said the Tidewater Inn was not notified by the Town Council ahead of July 1's meeting and hasn't heard from the town since. He believes \"it could have been a lot better handled.\"\nSmale also said he wished a \"different approach\" was taken to address noise concerns.\n\"We've been always respectful and trying to work with the town and the residents,\" Smale said. \" … I wish the Tidewater and ourselves would've been involved in the conversation a little bit more.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "American Legion Post 91 makes case for putting new fishing pier on other side of Route 50\n\n July 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 598\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — American Legion Post 91 Commander-elect Rich Colburn urged Cambridge City Council to encourage the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to build a new fishing pier in a different location from the Cambridge pier that was closed in December 2021.\"We think it's very meaningful that we have this conversation regarding a new fishing pier and the demolition of the other two,\" the former Maryland senator said on behalf of the American Legion at the council meeting July 8.\nIn 2021, the Bill Burton Fishing Pier State Park piers — one on the Talbot County side of the Choptank River and one on the Dorchester County side — were closed due to structural safety concerns. According to previous Star Democrat reporting, an underwater inspection in February 2022 revealed crumbling concrete in many areas of the structure below the water's surface.\nAt the July 8 meeting, Colburn told the council that there are three possibilities when it comes to locations for a new fishing pier — in Talbot County or on either side of Route 50 on the drive into Cambridge across the Frederick C. Malkus Bridge.\nColburn said the current location of the Dorchester County pier, which is next to the American Legion on Route 50, is \"probably the worst possible site.\" He said Post 91 thinks the Dorchester County Visitor Center side is the \"ideal\" spot in the county.\n\"But the Legion site has about 12 parking spots,\" he said. \"It's like a little matchbox.\"\nColburn said that Post 91 and residents in the neighborhood have had to get cars towed away and signage put up.\n\"I think it was a burden on your police department,\" he said.\nThe American Legion has been unsuccessful in trying to get DNR to lease the old fishing pier parking lot to them.\nColburn called it \"odd\" that DNR hasn't directly contacted Post 91 about potential plans for a new fishing pier due to the post's proximity to the possible new locations.\n\"We're very distraught that DNR doesn't seem to communicate with us,\" he said. \"But we think they will with the city and the county, particularly if you join together at a site that you both like.\"\nIn June, Gregg Bortz, media relations manager for DNR, said in an email to the Star Democrat that the department is working with both counties, as well as the Cambridge, to find \"the best option for access\" to the Choptank. He said the department is considering a few sites \"in the general vicinity of the current pier.\"\nBortz said after this process is complete, DNR plans to move forward with creating that access.\nAt the council meeting, Commissioner Brian Roche told Colburn that, to his knowledge, the city hasn't received any communication from DNR regarding the pier. He said he was invited to one meeting with DNR as a ward representative and, at that time, DNR said it only had money to demolish the pier.\n\"So it's news to me, and I think it's probably news to the rest of the commission, if there's been any forward movement on this,\" he said.\nCommissioner Laurel Atkiss said having a conversation about the fishing pier is important.\n\"I mean we were built on the river for a reason,\" she said. \"There are people in this city that live off of what they can catch. I think it's something very important that needs to be discussed.\"\nColburn said the American Legion is in support of a new fishing pier.\n\"We just think if hundreds of thousands of dollars are going to be spent with demolition and construction of the new fishing piers, they ought to be put in proper spots,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County Council votes to add ballot measures for November election\n\n July 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 657\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Come November, Dorchester County residents will decide whether or not to make changes to the county charter, including clarifying the county manager's responsibilities, adding language to ensure transparency and adjusting budget due dates.At a Dorchester County Council meeting on July 16, the council voted to approve six separate resolutions — which will be made into referendums on the November ballot. The council voted against approving one resolution that could have created a term limit for county council members.\nThe six resolutions, which were based on March recommendations by the Dorchester County Charter Review Committee, include:\nAdd language that solidifies the differences between the county manager's responsibilities and the council's responsibilities.Remove the residency requirement for the county manager.Remove the residency requirement for the director of finance.Require an administrative review to take place the first fiscal year of each new council.Change the due date for the proposed county budget from May 1 to May 15 and the due date for the adoption of the county budget from June 1 to June 15.Add language to ensure transparency.\nResidents will not be able to vote on whether county council members should be limited to three consecutive four-year terms in November.\nAt the July 16 meeting, Council President Larry Pfeffer was the only council member to vote in favor of the resolution. He said he voted this way because the county charter says that the charter should be reviewed every decade by a commission, and this was one of the modifications to the charter that the commission recommended.\n\"So I felt it would be best to leave it up to the voters themselves to see if they felt the term limits were something that should be modified in the charter,\" he said.\nCouncil Vice President Mike Detmer said he was voting against the resolution because he \"philosophically opposes\" these term limits. He said that every election is a term limit. Detmer also said that being a districted county rather than an at-large county limits the candidate pool.\n\"We want the best player available,\" he said. \"And if that person should sit there for four terms or five terms, that should be the decision of the people.\"\nBefore voting to approve the resolution regarding county manager responsibilities, the council amended its language.\nOne amendment clarifies that the council has a right to direct the county manager. Another makes it clear that individual council members cannot give orders to employees.\nRegarding the second amendment, Detmer said he took issue with phrasing in the resolution that says, \"council shall deal with administrative and departmental and departmental services solely through the county manager.\"\n\"Does this mean I cannot even send an email to them?\" he asked. \"That's how it could be construed.\"\nThis part of the resolution goes on to say, \"and neither the council nor any member thereof shall give orders to any subordinate employee, either publicly or privately.\"\nSusan Dukes, who was on the County Charter Review Committee and is the mayor of Secretary, said the intention of this particular change to the charter was to make it clear that no one council member should be able to make requests to department heads or employees on their own.\n\"You're hiring a county manager to do that job,\" she said. \"And that's what we felt like it should be because there has been past issues where that has become a problem. And we wanted to firm it up to make sure that you would act as a body and not as individuals.\"\nThe council voted to change the wording to make it clear that no individual council member should give orders to county staff.\nThough the majority of the resolutions passed unanimously, council member William Nichols voted against the resolutions regarding county manager responsibilities and governmental transparency.\nHe said he voted against the resolution for county manager responsibilities because he doesn't think that an appointed individual should have more authority than five people who were elected. He said he voted against the transparency resolution \"because it's already here now.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore hauled a large basket of food to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul's food pantry Wednesday evening, along with an even larger smile.The governor made his second public appearance on the Mid-Shore in as many months, speaking to local officials and volunteers of the Easton food pantry and thrift store.\n\"You all remind me of what it means to have hope,\" Moore said. \"You all remind us that we live in a big and a beautiful and a bright world and that we all have a place in it.\"\nHe mentioned that St. Vincent de Paul's work to help county residents in need comes \"at a time when we continue to allow political vitriol to create horrific images that we continue to see on our television screens.\"\nMoore has denounced \"political violence\" in statements since an assassination attempt on Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump less than a week ago. The shooting, which took place at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, July 13, left one spectator dead and Trump with a minor injury.\nThe governor's Easton visit came in the midst of a push by some Democratic leaders for President Joe Biden to reconsider his candidacy in the upcoming November election.\nMoore's name has been floated as a possible replacement for the president's atop the Democratic ticket. But the governor has been steadfast in his support of Biden.\nPrior to speaking Wednesday evening, Moore explained his support for the president.\nMoore pointed to the state's recovery in unemployment, a reduction in homicides and shootings, and the Port of Baltimore reopening — areas in which Biden's assistance has been crucial to Maryland, he said.\n\"Those things did not happen by accident,\" Moore said in an interview with The Star Democrat. \"They required leadership, and they required partnership. And I'm just really thankful that we have the president as a partner.\"\nMoore said the upcoming election between Biden and Donald Trump is a \"binary choice.\"\n\"For me, the choice between Donald Trump and President Biden is an easy one,\" Moore said. \"President Biden's consistently supported the people of our state, and I'm excited about thinking about what another four years of President Biden could be like.\"\nAlex Handy, president of the Easton chapter of St. Vincent de Paul, said during the governor's visit that Moore is \"one of the warmest people I've ever met.\"\n\"He (had a) big smile, came over, hugged people like crazy,\" Handy said.\nIt was the first time that Skip and Peggy Baraldi, volunteers at St. Vincent de Paul, saw the governor in person. Skip took notice of Moore's \"outgoing\" personality as he talked to the crowd for around 10 minutes.\nMoore thanked volunteers at St. Vincent de Paul's Easton chapter, an organization he said acts as the \"backbone of our social fabric\" in an interview with The Star Democrat. Talking to the crowd, Moore emphasized his faith.\n\"I do want to be very, very clear: I am a child of God,\" Moore said during his speech. \"I know who woke me up this morning. I know who will put me to bed tonight. … So when I say I'm thankful for you and I'm praying for you, I mean it.\"\n\"It's an honor to be your colleague, it's an honor to be your friend, it's an honor to be your neighbor, it's an honor to be your governor,\" Moore continued, drawing applause from the crowd. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We do not have access to any of our court systems right now. They are working of a fix... We can't access our court system at all so we are not able to view anything within the cases.\"\nA statement on the Maryland Judiciary website read, \"Due to the worldwide Microsoft outage, all Maryland courts, offices, and facilities will be closed to the public today but will remain open for emergency matters. All clerks' offices are closed.\"\nThe culprit behind the outage was determined to be cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.\nCrowdStrike said one of its software updates malfunctioned, causing some users' computers to go inert.\n\"CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,\" the company said in a statement Friday.\nWhile national and state outages caused some closures on the Mid-Shore, the impacts to local technology were not felt quite as significantly.\nLarge corporate data bases were more at risk than smaller, local computer users, according to some IT professionals.\n\"Most of the outage is going to be a higher level corporate customer,\" said Jon Sharp, general manager of Jason's Computers in Easton. \"We were worried this morning with the Microsoft stuff, but it hasn't seemed to trickle down to the residential customer.\"\nJeff Lankford, business and marketing coordinator for the Easton Airport, said the airport did not shut down operations Friday. Branch banker Amy McKenzie from PNC Bank in Easton said the bank had not had any problems.\nCrowdStrike said that it had already implemented a solution to the bad code problem causing the outages Friday afternoon. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

County staff and project consultants will be on hand to address any questions, comments or concerns from attendees.\n\"This project underscores Talbot County's commitment to maintaining and enhancing its infrastructure for the safety and benefit of all residents,\" the release read. \"A full road closure of a portion of Tunis Mills Road will be required during the construction period.\"\nDiscussions on the project started nearly 20 years ago when the county did a preliminary engineering report to look into replacing the bridge. In the late 2010s, the previous county council appropriated $1.8 million to the replacement project.\nThe county then went to the State Highway Administration to look into utilizing federal aid funding to replace the bridge. SHA provided an 80% grant, with 20% of local funding applied to the project. According to the county's website, total costs for the project could be up to $6 million.\nProposed changes to the old wooden bridge include adding an additional two feet of clearance, replacing timber piles with steel piles, adding a wooden laminated deck that can be paved over, widening the bridge slightly for walkers and improving a ramp and unloading platform. Several other bridges in the county have undergone similar laminated deck replacement.\nAccording to the county's website the design phase of the replacement project is almost complete, and an advertisement for construction is expected to go out in the late fall or early winter.\nFor those unable to attend the meeting Aug. 7, the Public Works is taking inquiries or feedback directly at clarke@talbotcountymd.gov, mmertaugh@talbotcountymd.gov or 410-770-8170. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Many stopped to watch the process, one woman insistent on carrying off a piece of the tree, others taking photos from the street.\nAccording to Queen Anne's County Public Works Department Chief of Engineering Lee Edgar, the courthouse elm tree displayed visual signs of distress last summer, including a wilting canopy and browning leaves.\nDespite the best efforts of the Public Works Department and the assistance of local and specialized arborists to diagnose and promptly treat the tree, assessments indicated it was stricken with Dutch Elm Disease, an intrinsic infection that attacks a tree's vascular system, Edgar said.\n\"We certainly gave it our best shot,\" he said.\nThe courthouse elm had previously been thought to have been of a variety resistant to fungal infections.\n\"And that was not the case,\" he said.\nThe tree is a field elm, and by best estimates was approximately 120 years old. The tree at the time of removal was about five and one-half feet in diameter and estimated to be about sixty feet tall.\n\"The loss certainly came as a sad day for us,\" Edgar said.\nQueen Anne's County is currently reviewing qualifications from tree experts to remove the elm.\nLocal sawmill Wood Ingenuity LLC of Queen Anne specializes in handling large sections of wood and has been tasked with milling.\n\"We're going to make the most of it,\" Edgar said.\nThe county is exploring ways to best repurpose the wood into the historic courthouse under renovation, including potential aspects such as plaques, gavels and furniture, he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Town Manager Tammy Kelledes said the town hopes to re-open the building Thursday.The town initially discovered multiple dead and alive bats in the Town Hall building on July 12. The building has been closed since July 12.\nKelledes said the town's insurance did not cover cleanup costs. She said removal of the bats cost the town just over $9,000. Duct work and deep cleaning each cost approximately $1,500.\n\"Since the attic isn't typically checked, this issue has unfortunately grown,\" the town wrote in a Facebook post after finding the bats.\nThe town added that bat droppings pose risks, necessitating the closure. \"It can carry harmful fungi that, when inhaled, can cause histoplasmosis — a respiratory disease that can be severe, especially for those with weakened immune systems,\" the town wrote.\nWhile Town Hall is closed, residents can go to Meeting Hall at 111 S Main Street for assistance, which is located across the parking lot from Town Hall.\nThey can also reach the town by calling 410-482-6222 or emailing greensboro@greensboromd.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "County, state leaders break ground on St. Vincent de Paul expansion\n\n August 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 585\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — County and state leaders joined together Thursday morning to ceremonially break ground on the expansion and remodeling of St. Vincent de Paul, a nonprofit organization that provides food, shelter and clothing assistance to Talbot County residents in need.Though the project still needs a town permit to begin actual construction, stakeholders gathered to celebrate the progress the nonprofit has made toward growing its space and offerings.\nThe expansion and remodeling will increase the current 7,200-square-foot building on Canvasback Drive by 2,560 square feet. It will grow the organization's space for its food pantry, thrift store and advisory offices.\nAlex Handy, president of the Easton Chapter of St. Vincent de Paul, spoke at the ceremony about the building's growth since he joined the organization.\n\"We have an incredible facility here,\" Handy said. \"We're about to expand it even larger. And we have hundreds of volunteers. And all I can say (is) that God must've had a vision for where we were going, because I can tell you 22 years ago, we had no idea we'd be here today.\"\nWillow Construction has designed a floor plan for the remodel, which attendees could look at on Thursday. St. Vincent de Paul Vice President John Plaskon says Willow Construction's general contracting service will cost about $898,000. Additional costs for engineering, plumbing and architecture may put the total mark over $1 million, Plaskon said.\nTo help with funding, St. Vincent de Paul is receiving a $625,000 grant from the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development. The department's assistant secretary, Carol Gilbert, attended Thursday's ceremony.\n\"You guys are doing something right, I'm sure,\" Gilbert said. \"I'm really impressed by the volume of support of services that you give to your community.\"\nTalbot County Council Member Keasha Haythe also talked to the crowd about the organization's importance to Talbot County, calling it an \"exciting day\" for the county. Last month, the council allocated $100,000 in American Rescue Plan Act funds for the nonprofit's expansion project.\nPlaskon said the project may take around eight to nine months once a permit is issued and work commences. He hopes that all sections of St. Vincent de Paul will remain operational for as much time as possible during construction.\nPart of the added-on space will include a new food pantry. Plaskon said that if they can move the pantry from its old area to the new one between its normal Tuesday and Saturday distribution days, no services will be affected.\nThe thrift store, though, will have to close down for a short period.\n\"The thrift store generates half the revenue that we need to operate. The other half comes from donations,\" Plaskon said. \"We want to minimize how long it's shut down. But there's no way around it, it's going to have to happen, it's just a matter of how many weeks.\"\nIn addition to a larger space for the pantry, thrift store and meeting rooms, Plaskon said the site's parking situation will be improved. Plaskon said the \"parking lot gets really jammed up\" on Saturday mornings when the pantry distributes and the thrift store and boutique are open.\nDuring the ceremony, Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) spoke to the crowd, emphasizing the current economic struggles residents are experiencing and thanking the St. Vincent de Paul volunteers.\n\"Being able to have this resource in the community is a life-saver for so many, so many that can't afford anything, and there's some that can afford some, but they still need some help,\" Mautz said. \"And this has become just a critical part of the Mid-Shore community.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Port Street housing project nearing completion\n\n August 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 675\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Nine affordable housing units and a new headquarters for a local nonprofit organization are nearing completion on Port Street. The Port Street Commons, a project led by The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, is slated to finish construction in October.The project includes nine apartments — seven two-bedroom units and two three-bedroom units — and approximately 10,000 square feet of space for The Arc's new regional headquarters, featuring offices and a behavioral health suite.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Jonathon Rondeau, president and CEO of The Arc, gave a tour of the 24,000-square-foot space to Jake Day, Maryland's secretary of housing and community development.\nConstruction workers were in action on the site, and drywall and insulation was installed on the first and second floors of the three-story building. Day called it a \"great looking building.\"\nRondeau pointed out the importance of bringing immediate assistance to those in need of housing in the Easton area, which is why his team has worked to aim for completion in under four years. The site was identified in July of 2021, and construction began last June. \"We want to move quickly,\" Rondeau said.\n$6.5 million of the project's approximate $11-million price tag has been raised, and The Arc is nearing the end of its capital campaign. Rondeau told Day that The Arc is financing the gap of around $4.5 million.\n\"If we wanted to raise the full $11 million, that would've taken us about eight years,\" Rondeau said.\nDay was impressed with the pace of the Port Street project, asking Rondeau, \"can we set you up with lots of other developers to help guide them through the process as speedily as The Arc has gotten through?\"\nA ribbon cutting is planned for Nov. 7. Rondeau said the first batch of tenants will move in Dec. 1, with a second batch coming in on Jan. 2. The Arc's headquarters will open in January.\nEight of the nine units will accept tenants based on a public lottery system. The ninth unit is designated to the Talbot Interfaith Shelter to house someone transitioning out of the shelter.\n\"Because of the site plan, all nine units are slightly different,\" Rondeau said, \"which was not the most economical, but it was the only way we could maximize getting nine units into the available square footage.\"\nAll of the units will feature free Wi-Fi and appliances including a microwave, along with \"solid surface countertops\" and carpet in bedrooms to save money in the back end for property management. The units will be managed by Chesapeake Neighbors, a housing subsidiary of The Arc.\nRondeau said two of the units on the first floor are \"universally designed,\" with accessible bathrooms and appliances meant to accommodate those with disabilities.\nAs Day and other members of the Department of Housing and Community Development toured the space, Rondeau pointed out how the office spaces will support The Arc's overarching goal of providing counseling and assistance to those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\nThe headquarters are expected to add around 35 jobs to the area. Rondeau said employees at the Easton site will have health insurance. A full-time nurse will also be in the building.\n\"Three years ago, The Arc decided to self-insure our health insurance for our employees,\" he said. \"And we have a partnership. We provide free urgent and primary care to all of our employees.\"\nRondeau is excited for The Arc's services to continue expanding outside of Anne Arundel County, which is where the organization was founded and has the largest presence.\n\"We've grown significantly over the last 25 years here in Easton,\" Rondeau said. \"We wanted to have an Eastern Shore headquarters.\"\nThe project is the first building in Easton to fall under the town's mixed-use waterfront zoning district regulations, Rondeau said. Passed in 2019, the zoning code emphasizes connecting the Easton Point waterfront to the town's downtown area. Rondeau said The Arc made sure to have the front doors of the project facing Port Street as part of the zoning expectations.\nAfter the tour, Day thanked Rondeau and expressed his support for The Arc's fast-moving efforts.\n\"It's an awesome project, it's an incredible project,\" Day said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But just three days after announcing the hire on June 24, the Commissioners of Oxford announced the town and Calvert had \"mutually agreed to part ways.\"\nShortly after the news of Calvert's hire, some community members expressed concerns about the town's candidate vetting process.\nIn an effort to move forward with finding a new candidate, Commissioner Katrina Greer introduced the resolution during a July 9 meeting, requiring the town to use a \"professional search team that specializes in local government.\"\nDuring the workshops Wednesday, separate interviews were held for the two firms, GovHRUSA and Berkley Group.\nEach firm gave a presentation showing the goals, working timeline and outreach that could be done if they were hired. After each presentation, the commissioners asked questions of the firms.\nCommissioner Katrina Greer requested a thorough understanding of the background checks each firm conducts on candidates.\nCharlene Stevens, executive vice president for recruitment services at GovHRUSA, said her firm prides itself on ensuring well-researched candidates.\n\"We do media searches on candidates, to understand what is out there on them, as well as be able to have a conversation with them,\" Stevens said. \"If there's media that is concerning, then … Mike (senior consultant) will review that information with you and make sure that you are comfortable moving forward with the candidate.\"\nKelsey Wong, chief operating officer for Berkley Group, said her firm uses a third-party background check to assess candidates but at the time could not remember the name of the company and said she could provide that information later.\nGreer stated it was vital for the firm to come back with the company name since the background check was essential for hiring a new candidate.\n\"We had a problem with (background checks), and we would want criminal search to go back a number of years, do the credit check, do the civil check, etc. because people are handling money and purchases, etc.,\" Greer said. \"And a national criminal check going back 23 years.\"\nEach commissioner asked questions concerning issues of the timeline of hire, whether or not the firms have worked with communities with populations below 1,000, networking and how the firms involve the community in the hiring process.\nCommissioner Tom Costigan said the workshop was informative and helpful for the process of finding a new town manager.\n\"It's important to us because we're basically doing our due diligence to find the best possible candidate for our town manager position,\" Costigan said.\nA decision will be made in the \"next couple of weeks,\" and a follow up meeting with Berkley Group was requested to be scheduled to meet the rest of the team and to have a better understanding of the firm's background check process, according to Greer. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In April 2022, Bradshaw pleaded guilty to five counts of distributing revenge porn.\nCurrent Mayor Stephen Rideout, who is not seeking reelection, was elected to fill the remainder of Bradshaw's term.\nBradshaw will run against Cambridge Commission President Lajan Cephas, who served as the city's interim mayor after Bradshaw resigned and before Rideout took office.\nCephas also has faced legal issues. In 2022, she was charged with second-degree assault in connection with a domestic violence incident in her Cambridge home. The charges were dismissed in January 2023.\nAs of Monday, Bradshaw and Cephas were the only two listed as approved candidates for the Oct. 19 mayoral election on the city's website. The deadline to file is Tuesday.\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat, Bradshaw said he is running primarily due to an \"outpouring of support\" that he has received.\n\"And that was, I think, largely based on the background that I had when I was in office previously and our ability to move forward various parts of a broad-sweeping agenda that was aimed at improving Cambridge throughout the city,\" he said. \"Not just in one neighborhood or in one aspect of the city's needs, but across all the various areas of need and geography in Cambridge.\"\nBradshaw wants to keep the focus of his campaign on where Cambridge is now and where it is going, rather than on his past legal issues. He said he thinks voters feel the same way.\n\"While I understand that there will be some thoughts and some attention given to those things, I think that where we stand now and where we can go in the future is really where I want to keep the focus,\" he said.\nA news release from the Bradshaw for Cambridge Committee said during Bradshaw's time in office, the city started giving residential property tax credits for public safety officer recruitment, increased salaries for police officers, replaced and upgraded Cambridge Police Department and Public Services Department vehicles, expanded ethics reporting requirements for city representatives and began the planning and implementation of the Homeownership Works program, a state pilot program created to increase affordable homeownership opportunities.\nBradshaw said he thinks that as mayor, he served as a catalyst for the City Council to move issues forward and work toward solving them.\n\"And I think the same will be true this time,\" he said. \"That though there will be commissioners that have excellent ideas, that I'll be able to serve as a catalyst to get those ideas from the point of discussion to the point of decision.\"\nCephas, who has served on the city council since 2021, said in a text that being qualified for the position of mayor doesn't make you the best candidate. She said that after Bradshaw's resignation, she proved that she is capable and committed in the position of mayor.\n\"During (those) nine months with powers of mayor, we established the Gun Violence Task Force, resulting in 65% decrease in murder and decrease in violent crime in the city,\" she said.\nCephas said it's important for voters to believe in the legal system and \"allow it to work.\"\nShe spoke about the importance of moving forward with a vision of a one Cambridge.\n\"We've notice Cambridge is divided on many platforms from policing, CWDI, businesses, race relations, community development and housing to name a few,\" she said. \"We are divided in many ways in Cambridge, and (the) mayor should be the unifying agent bringing the city's business forward, not back.\"\nCephas said that if elected mayor, she will be committed to moving the city's business forward \"with the spirit of ONE Cambridge.\"\nCambridge's city election will be held Oct. 19. All five Cambridge City Council seats will be up for grabs, along with the mayor's seat. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the list, every race except for the Ward 5 commissioner race has at least two people running.\nMAYORAL RACEThere are three candidates vying for the open mayor seat: Cambridge Commission President Lajan Cephas, former Cambridge Mayor Andrew Bradshaw and former Cambridge Commissioner La-Shon Foster.\nCurrent Mayor Stephen Rideout said in June that he would not be running for reelection. He told the Star Democrat when he ran in 2022, he only intended to fill the remainder of the term of Bradshaw, who resigned in January 2022 after being charged for distributing revenge porn on Reddit.\nBradshaw told the Star Democrat Aug. 5 that he is running primarily due to an \"outpouring of support\" he has received. He said when he was previously in office, the council moved forward multiple pieces of \"a broad-sweeping agenda\" aimed at improving the entire city. He said he thinks he served as a catalyst for city council to move issues forward and work toward solving them.\n\"And I think the same will be true this time,\" he said. \"That though there will be commissioners that have excellent ideas, that I'll be able to serve as a catalyst to get those ideas from the point of discussion to the point of decision.\"\nBradshaw wants to keep the focus of his campaign on where Cambridge is now and where it is going, rather than on his past legal issues, and he thinks voters feel the same.

She talked about her more than 30 years of experience as a social worker and community organizer, which she said puts her in the right position to help move Cambridge forward.\nFoster said the city needs to invest in its children. She said there needs to be activities that meet the needs of the majority of Cambridge's children. She said lot of the activities available now are not affordable for all families.\n\"I feel that with the right leadership, with the right dedication and the right motivation, the citizens of Cambridge can win and we can all win and we can all arrive at a good place at the same time, together,\" she said. \"And I feel that I am that candidate that will bring Cambridge together holistically.\"\nCOMMISSIONER RACESIncumbent Commissioner Laurel Atkiss is running against Brett Summers for the Ward 1 seat. Atkiss was elected in June 2023 in a special election to finish the unexpired term of then Ward 1 Commissioner Brian Roche.\nJenna LeCompte, Nancy Jackson, Jermaine Anderson and Shay Lewis-Sisco are running for the open Ward 2 seat, which is currently held by Lajan Cephas.\nFrank Stout and Gary Gordy will vie for the Ward 3 commissioner seat, which is currently held by Commissioner Jameson Harrington. In June, Harrington told the Star Democrat that he would not be seeking reelection. He said he likes to volunteer and help, but politics is \"just not my forte.\"\nIncumbent Commissioner Sputty Cephas and former Commissioner Dave Cannon are seeking the Ward 4 commission seat. Sputty Cephas has served as commissioner since 2021.\nIncumbent Commissioner Brian Roche will be the only candidate on the ballot in the Ward 5 race. Roche was elected as commissioner of the ward in June 2023 in a special election to finish the unexpired term of former Commissioner Chad Malkus. Before that, Roche served as commissioner of Ward 1, which he was sworn into in 2021.\nAssistant City Manager Brandon Hesson said that in the races with more than two candidates, there will need to be a run-off election unless a candidate secures more than 50% of the vote on Oct. 19. If necessary, a run-off election will be held Dec. 3.\nThe election is being run by the city. Hesson said the city is using a third-party company to handle the ballots. The deadline for voter registration is 4 p.m. on Sept. 27. Residents can register to vote at the Dorchester County Board of Elections. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Dodd said each election cycle, they open a brick-and-mortar headquarters \"for the run-up to election day.\"\nThe headquarters acts as a central location where residents can get Republican candidate campaign materials or receive assistance in registering to vote or switching their party affiliation.\nDodd said the committee knows there are \"JFK Democrats\" in the community that no longer align with the Democratic Party. He said the committee also wants to register young voters who identify with Republican policies.\nHaving a headquarters in the heart of Cambridge, where many people will see it, is something that is important to the committee.\n\"The headquarters opened just (one week) after the attempted assassination of President Trump, and we saw the timely establishment of our headquarters as a message that we remain undeterred by political violence.\"\nDodd said that since setting up on Gay Street, the headquarters has received a positive response from the public. He said there has been a \"massive demand\" for campaign materials from the committee.\nAlthough store hours have yet to be announced, the committee will be hosting a grand opening for its new digs on Friday, Aug. 9 at 6 p.m. Dodd said the committee plans to have light fare and merchandise giveaways at the event, which is open to the public. He said they will also have some \"special guests\" at the event.\nAttendees will be able to purchase merchandise for the committee's Choptank River Boats for Trump Parade, which will be held Aug. 11 at 1 p.m. The parade will start at Long Wharf in Cambridge and end at Suicide Bridge Restaurant in Hurlock.\nDodd said the committee can be reached via Facebook or email at docomdgop@gmail.com. He said it always welcomes volunteers. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Despite mixed public reactions at past town meetings, no members of the public spoke Monday evening.The proposal comes from Lane Engineering on behalf of NAI Saturn Eastern and Safeway, along with Miller Development Corporation, the potential developers of the project. It includes 24 partially-connected townhomes and nine standalone units. The property, which has been vacant since 2017, sits at 139 N Washington St.\nCouncil members mentioned discussions with developers about a per-unit contribution to the town's affordable housing efforts. Ward 1 Council Member Maureen Curry said it's her \"understanding that the developer has agreed\" to those contributions.\n\"We discussed the possibility of a $10,000 per-unit support of the affordable housing fund,\" Ward 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello said, \"with $5,000 coming at the building permit stage and $5,000 at the moment of getting the permit of occupancy.\"\nTown Attorney Sharon VanEmburgh said she will work with Ryan Showalter, an attorney representing Miller Development Corporation, in the lead up to the next town meeting Aug. 19 so that a potential vote on the proposal comes to the council.\nFIRE DEPARTMENTSonny Jones, chief of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, presented a report to the Town Council on Monday detailing the station's activity through the month of July.\nAs of July 31, the department has responded to 540 fire or rescue incidents this year, 255 of which came in the months of May, June and July, Jones said.\n\"I really want to point out that this is an all-volunteer organization, and as of July 31, our members have spent 8,515.07 hours in service to the community,\" Jones told the council. \"And I'm very, very proud of all the men and women who do that.\"\nJones pointed out that Mondays around 3 p.m. tend to be the department's busiest time. He also said there's been a decrease in the number of false alarms.\n\"(Ward 2 Council Member Don) Abbatiello has assisted us with that in taking great strides to try to reduce the amount of false alarms,\" Jones said. \"We have done some outreach to businesses which were problematic, and encouraged them to have a system to maintain.\"\nJones also said the fire department has raised $3.2 million to date for a training facility project that has been in the works. He said a construction contract was awarded to Willow Construction.\nThe new training facility, which will be located at 9095 Mistletoe Drive in Easton, will be a hub for all volunteer firefighters across the Mid-Shore region who are looking for specialized education.\n\"This is an exciting project for us,\" Jones said. \"It's the first of its kind in the area … And we're going to see some significant start in September for the building of that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'It's iconic': Tunis Mills residents push back against county design for bridge replacement\n\n August 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 692\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TUNIS MILLS — More than 50 people gathered at St Stephens AME Church Wednesday evening to engage with county leaders regarding proposed construction to replace the Leeds Creek Bridge in Tunis Mills.County employees and project engineers presented plans to replace the 345-foot wooden bridge. Designs propose a structure with a \"laminated timber deck\" and \"asphalt wearing surface.\"\nResidents living in and around Tunis Mills expressed a bevy of concerns about county designs Wednesday evening. Many testified to the bridge's uniqueness and fit in the community, while others are worried an asphalt surface would jeopardize the safety for residents, particularly children and teenagers.\n\"People love this bridge, it's iconic,\" Doug Marvin, who lives near the bridge, said. \"I didn't grow up here, and I heard about it years before I bought the house where I did. It's like tradition for every kid that goes to school in this county to jump off the bridge … It's used in photographs, for tourism, to get people to come to this county.\"\nPrompted by a question from the audience, nearly every single attendee raised a hand when posed with the choice of a timber surface versus an asphalt one.\nAt the end of the meeting, County Manager Clay Stamp said that the county and its public works department \"will go back to the drawing board to a degree\" to explore the wooden surface option.\n\"At this point I think it's fair to assure you that moving in the direction of a wooden deck bridge is the direction we are seeking,\" Stamp said.\nPROJECT DESIGNSThe meeting began with a presentation of the proposed designs, which the county has said is around 90 to 95% complete.\nProposed changes to the bridge include adding an additional two feet of clearance, replacing timber piles with steel piles, adding a wooden laminated deck that can be paved over, widening the bridge slightly for walkers and improving a ramp and unloading platform. Several other bridges in the county have undergone similar laminated deck replacements.\nThe Talbot County Council first discussed replacing the bridge in 2007, allocating $1.8 million to the replacement project. Now, the project's estimated cost is around $6 million, with around $4.5 million federally funded.\nMark Ledebur, an engineering consultant, noted drawbacks to a full timber structure at Wednesday's meeting.\nHe said county experiences show an asphalt surface is less labor-intensive, easier to plow, smoother and easier to replace. Ledebur also presented quotes obtained by the county for timber boards in the case of replacement.\nOne resident asked if the county could compare costs for timber boards and asphalt, along with how often each material may have to be replaced. County Engineer Ray Clarke said his department could work on those comparisons.\nA project schedule shown to attendees on Wednesday projected a final decision for the bridge replacement this September, though Clarke emphasized the county is not ready to submit and is keeping the option of a wooden surface open.\nRESIDENT INPUTSusan McDermott leads a citizen group vowing for the bridge on Tunis Mills Road to remain as a full wooden structure.\nThe group, which has met with the county in the past, asserts that a timber structure is more durable than other materials and has environmental benefits. During the meeting, McDermott emphasized that the Leeds Creek Bridge is unique compared to busier bridges in Talbot County.\n\"Don't put an asphalt smear in the middle of our community,\" McDermott said. \"We don't want it, and we don't need it.\"\nMany residents that spoke Wednesday said an asphalt surface would only encourage speeding across the bridge. Both the current posted speed limit and the proposed one are 15 mph.\nSome were worried for the safety of children and teenagers who jump off the bridge into the creek as an unofficial tradition in the area. Resident Claudia Donegan said kids \"interact with this bridge intimately.\"\nPeter Stifel lives right across from the bridge and has driven over it for almost 60 years. On Wednesday, Stifel said his support for a wooden replacement is a \"vote for tradition.\"\n\"It is the heart and soul of a village,\" Stifel said of the bridge. \"And I'd hate to see it succumb to the plastic, push-button world that we are all being forced into.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This first part of the project, a 2,080-foot trail, stretches from Jackson Street to Delaware Avenue.\nHurlock Town Manager John Avery said the trail is a \"relatively flat,\" six-foot-wide, paved asphalt trail with eight solar streetlights, three steel benches and trashcans placed along it.\nSince its opening, the path gotten a lot of use. Avery said residents have reacted positively to the new public space.\n\"Everybody said that it's great they can have a place they can walk that's safe, that's lit at night,\" he said.\nHurlock Town Council Member Russell Murphy said in an email that the trail has been used \"much more than expected.\"\n\"Every time I have been on it or ridden by it, there are people using it,\" he said. \"We are so looking forward to completing phase two and phase three.\"\nMurphy said he first introduced the idea for the trail as a way to light up Railroad Avenue and make it safer.\n\"Once seeing some of the rails-to-trails projects going on, it was brought up again as a way to provide a path from one end of town to another with safety and health also being in the forefront,\" he said.\nOnce all three phases of the project are complete, the trail will stretch 1.5 miles from one end of the town to the other, ending at North Main Street Park. To complete the last two phases of the project, Murphy said the county will need to take ownership of the railroad and then the town can ask for the county's permission to proceed with applying for grant funding.\nMurphy said the Town Council hopes the trail will draw in visitors.\n\"We are hoping that anyone passing through will want to walk the trail and see what Hurlock has to offer,\" he said.\nOn Aug. 3, the town held a grand opening for the trail. Avery said the event went well, with Hurlock Mayor Rev. Charles T. Cephas and four of the Town Council's five council members in attendance.\nMurphy called the grand opening \"a monumental event.\" He said although the turnout was light, he hopes that word will get out and the trail will bring in prospective residents and businesses.\nIt took about two years for the trail to get built. Avery said the majority of that time was spent securing grant funding from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, which funded $82,000 of the approximately $105,000 project through the Community Parks and Playgrounds Program.\n\"The property is owned by Delmarva Power, so there was a joint-use agreement that had to go in place between Delmarva Power, the Department of Natural Resources and the town,\" Avery said. \"And it took quite a while to get that worked out.\"\nAvery said that after the agreement was worked out, the town was able to secure the grant funding for the project.\nMurphy said the project could not have come to fruition if not for Avery and Cephas. He said the trail can bring residents closer together.\n\"When an activity, such as a park or trail, gets people outside, it will bring the community closer together,\" he said. \"Its great to see neighbors and friends out and about so we can communicate and stay in touch with each other.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now, the council has scheduled a special session to again go over the requests before the application deadline passes.During the meeting on Aug. 7, community member Cheryl Lewis went before the council and requested approval for two items.\nThe first was permission to submit an application request on Aug. 21 to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Community Parks and Playgrounds Program to obtain funds for a girls softball field.\nThe second was to make a motion to approve, contingent on the state, a change in the joint agreement between Talbot County and Trappe required for the grant fund application. The change would name the county as the local government responsible for the park maintenance.\nAccording to Lewis, Maryland has pre-prepared a joint agreement for seeking park funds stating the local town government is responsible for maintaining the park's \"attractive appearance.\"\nLewis requested the town council pass a motion changing the joint agreement to clarify that Talbot County will be responsible for the park, not Trappe.\nCommissioner Walter Chase, a member of the county park advisory board, said Lewis should attend a park advisory board meeting for further approval.\n\"I'm on the park board, so I'm gonna have to get a field from the park board before I sign anything right here because I don't get myself in trouble,\" Chase said.\nLewis said she had met with the county's parks advisory board during their last meeting and they had approved the concept of the softball field.\n\"(The park advisory board) did approve the concept of the softball field,\" Lewis said. \"The joint agreement part they don't have authority to do. That's between (Trappe) and the Talbot County Council, and I'm talking to the... County Council at their meeting next week.\"\nLewis urged the council to pass the two motions, stating that applications are only accepted within the month of August and once the month passes they will not be able to apply until next year.\nDuring the vote, Commissioner Rosalee Potter and Chase did not approve the motion to approve the application, and it failed to pass.\nChase said he would like to bring it back up with the parks board for approval. Potter said, \"this is not anything personal. I am just accustomed to doing things more in order.\"\nIn order to stay within the August deadline, the Trappe Council will hold a special meeting the morning of Aug. 19 with the purpose of reviewing the grant funding application requests to be submitted. The public is welcomed to appear. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Department head reports will be placed on the consent agenda. Commissioner Katrina Greer said this will allow for more legislative time at meetings.\nThe resolution, effective immediately, permits the commissioners to develop and adopt administrative policies that \"promote good governance and transparency.\"\nGreer made the motion to pass the resolution at the commission meeting on Tuesday. The resolution was passed unanimously.\n\"We've been talking about how to best deal with each other and the staff and setting up some norms,\" Greer said before the vote.\nWhen it comes to agenda setting, the resolution sets deadlines for when items can be submitted and states that the commissioners must approve the agenda.\nThe administrative guide will break down what commissioners must approve and be notified of and what decisions and tasks are under the authority of the town manager or clerk treasurer. The guide will also details that in the event there is not a town manager, those duties will be taken on by the clerk treasurer with guidance from the commissioners.\nThe town has been without a manager since the retirement of former Town Manager Cheryl Lewis at the end of June.\nThe commissioners' next open session meeting will be next Tuesday, Aug. 20 at 6 p.m.\nGreer said the commissioners will also be holding a special closed meeting on Friday to discuss search firm contracts. The town is seeking a search firm to help in its search for the next town manager.\nCommission President Norm Bell said the commissioners started with a list of seven search firms and have since narrowed it down to five. He said some due diligence is still needed before the commission can come to a decision, but if all goes well, the commissioners will vote on a search firm next Tuesday. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said Delmarva Power and Light recently met with the town about it.\nJeff Middleton, senior program manager for vegetation management at Delmarva Power and Light, said that across the nation, between 40 and 50% of all electrical outages are caused by trees, making the maintenance of vegetation near power lines important. He said the company follows industry standards when it comes to trimming trees, including using directional pruning to \"encourage vegetation to grow away from the power lines.\"\nDuring the meeting, residents expressed concerns that the trees had been trimmed back too far. Art Murr said his neighbor's tree was trimmed all the way back to the bird's nest.\n\"The tree, honestly, was butchered,\" he said.\nResident Barbara Paca said the tree Murr is referring to will probably die of sunscald due to the way it was trimmed by the contractors hired by Delmarva Power and Light.\nIn response to residents' concerns, Middleton said he understood the change can be \"stark\" and \"jarring.\"\n\"But please know the trees that we're looking at, they were trimmed four years ago,\" he said. \"The trees that were lush, they are going to be lush again. I wouldn't have a job if I killed every tree along the power lines and if they didn't grow back.\"\nMurr said he understood what Middleton was saying, but wanted to point out the \"stark\" difference in how his neighbor's tree was trimmed this year compared to four years ago.\nOther concerns brought up by residents include the look of the trimmed trees, Delmarva Power and Light's notification standards and safety to personal property.\nResident Leslie Howells said when the tree outside her home was trimmed, no one knocked on her door to notify her to move her car, which was parked beneath the tree in the driveway. She said her car was within four feet of the tree that they were pruning \"big tree limbs\" from.\nMiddleton said that if there is any concern about damaging private property, the workers will not proceed.\n\"Apparently the people that were there, they felt comfortable that they could perform the work safely, and they proceeded,\" he said.\nHowells said that was unacceptable and residents should be properly notified of when the tree trimmings will take place.\nOxford commissioners also voiced some concern at the meeting. Commissioner Katrina Greer said when she and Oxford Wastewater Superintendent Matt Ozman approached one of the sites where trees were being trimmed, there was no supervisor.\nBoth Greer and Commission President Norm Bell, acknowledging they aren't arborists, said some trees looked over-cut.\nSheehy said this reaction from residents is common when the trees are trimmed. She said utility directional pruning is different from how an arborist might prune because some limbs need to be trimmed in a way that could seem over-cut.\n\"But it has to be done there because of the nature of directional pruning,\" she said.\nMiddleton said he suggested to the commissioners that the community put together a tree council. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bradley Park suggested for future dog park in St. Michaels\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 679\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — A group of St. Michaels residents want a dog park in what they call an \"underutilized park,\" but the town administrator and some commissioners seemed reluctant to commit to it at a Wednesday night meeting.The Commissioners of St. Michaels did not vote on the issue, and the item was moved to the next meeting in September.\nMitch Ettinger, founder of Friends of the Dog Park, came dressed for the occasion — a shirt decorated with dog drawing and a folder covered with dogs wearing sunglasses.\nFor over three years, Friends of the Dog Park, a group of St. Michaels residents and dog owners, have been advocating for a park to bring their dogs and create community.\nNow in front of a new commission, Ettinger recommended Bradley Park for the dog park. According to Ettinger, the one-acre park is underutilized; there are few residential homes located nearby. Bradley Park is also already unkempt by the town, and it would not require additional acquisition funds.\nEttinger said the overall cost of the park would be approximately half a million dollars to remove the old playground equipment, create a fence and renovate the park to better fit a dog park. The Friends of the Dog Park has filed to become a nonprofit and will plan to raise the funds through donations and grants so the cost would not fall on St. Michaels residents.\nEttinger asked commissioners to tentatively approve Bradley Park as the future St. Michaels dog park and to direct town staff to retain an engineering firm to prepare a site plan that will be submitted to the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board and Planning Commission.\nThe group asked for about $7,000 for the site survey because all efforts up until now have been completed and paid for by residents.\n\"[Friends of the Dog Park] might feel that the town has skin in the game,\" Ettinger said. \"That we don't have to go out and raise $7,000 in our pockets to have a site plan that ultimately could be shut down.\"\nRob Straebel, town administrator, raised concerns he had with the park, stating a need for more public comment from residents before moving forward.\n\"I know that this community, they take their parks very seriously,\" Straebel said. \"And unfortunately, this is going to be a fair amount of people that are opposed to it, and there's probably going to be a fair amount of people that would love to see a dog park there.\"\nCommissioner Katrina Whittington raised questions over the town's prioritizes when it comes to supporting projects. According to Whittington, the town was deciding whether to pay over $200,000 for a small plan for a dog park and yet there is concerns over funding a site plan for Bradley Park.\nStraebel said the $200,000 would have been a \"policy decision\" by commissioners for a different property.\nMore questions and potential ideas were raised by commissioners. Some suggesting bifurcating Bradley Park and updating the playground equipment, others sharing concern for the price of the park and public opinion of the park.\nEttinger reminded commissioners that he had offered to do a survey the last time he was in front of the council and he was told not to.\nAdditionally, he said, when the town hired an architect to come up with a master plan for the seven acres at San Domingo Park, a survey of the entire town was done and from the residents who participated, their No. 1 request was a dog park.\nA few resident commented that there is a responsibility from the new commissioners to work toward a dog park since during the commission election last spring they had said they would approve it.\nWhittington suggested the commissioners move the subject to the next meeting but noted that the idea of a dog park has not seen much progress in years.\n\"This seems like Groundhog Day all over again,\" Whittington said. \"... This is ridiculous just to get a dog park here at St. Michaels.\"\nAfter a bit of back and forth from commissioners and town residents, the council decided to delay further discussion on the park until the September meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Town Council approves 33-unit housing project at former Safeway site\n\n August 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 620\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A proposal for a 33-unit housing development at the site of the former Safeway in downtown Easton was unanimously approved by the Easton Town Council on Monday evening.The proposal came from Lane Engineering on behalf of NAI Saturn Eastern and Safeway, along with Miller Development Corporation, the potential developers of the project. It includes 24 partially-connected townhomes and nine standalone units. The property, which has been vacant since 2017, sits at 139 N. Washington St.\nThe town's planning and historic district commissions reviewed the proposal before it landed on the Town Council's agenda this summer. On Monday, council members gave the green light to the project, which fell under the town's planned unit development infill subdistrict.\n\"I can assure you that we all thought long and hard about this,\" Ward 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello said before the vote. \"This was not a quick decision. … This is going to be a decision that is going to outlive our tenures on the council.\"\nTown Attorney Sharon VanEmburgh discussed three conditions included in a findings of fact for the application prior to the vote.\nThe first condition requires developers to contribute $10,000 per unit to the town's affordable housing fund, with $5,000 due when the unit's building permit is issued and the other $5,000 due when the unit becomes occupied.\nThe second condition indicates the units \"shall be privately maintained by a homeowners' association established for the community, which shall also provide private trash collection for all residences of the PUD District.\"\n\"They have to include that in their covenants,\" VanEmburgh said, \"so there is notice to everyone who buys a piece of property there that it will be private trash pickup.\"\nThe final condition states if developers stray too much from the approved architecture of the homes, the project will have to return to the town's planning and historic district commissions for review.\nWhile an Aug. 5 public hearing went by without resident input, many concerns were brought to the council at the project's previous public hearings in June and July. Abbatiello directly addressed those concerns prior to the vote Monday, including traffic, parking and the prospect of building a grocery store at the site.\n\"Traffic was another concern that was raised by many of my constituents,\" Abbatiello said, \"and while the 33 units will add some traffic to the area, it will be significantly less than what was there when Safeway was open.\"\nAbbatiello added that after following up on Town Council discussions about parking, he learned there are \"over 550 parking spots, not including on-street parking, in the downtown area.\" Some residents' wishes that a grocery store replace Safeway \"comes down to the fact that the current owner of the property is not going to sell it with the idea of developing another grocery store in that spot,\" he said.\nAbbatiello's most difficult hurdle in fully supporting the project was the affordability aspect, he said.\n\"None of these units are going to be affordable,\" Abbatiello said. \"We need housing for seniors, which was mentioned a lot. We need apartments that don't charge $1,600 for a one-bedroom. We do need those things. But when you look at the sale price for this property, there's no way a developer could purchase that and turn it into an affordable housing project.\"\nAbbatiello thanked Robert Miller, the founder of Miller Development Corporation, for listening to council concerns and agreeing to \"financially support an infrastructure project that's going to provide necessary workforce housing to town employees.\"\nWard 1 Council Member Maureen Curry echoed Abbatiello's statements and thanked developers.\n\"I could not have said it any better and I thank you for all the same reasons,\" Curry said. \"And I appreciate the Miller (Development Corporation) stepping up and donating $10,000 per unit to our affordable housing fund.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

DeKarske discussed the organization's efforts in improving the visitor center, which includes procuring quotes for new outside signage and providing an interior that follows Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility requirements.\nWard 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry asked if there was a holdup in the town's work on redesigning the interior of the visitor center.\n\"There was a design, we are now tweaking, changing the design slightly,\" Mayor Megan Cook said. \"Yes, there had been a holdup.\"\nDeKarske noted other updates, such as welcoming Tom Maglio as marketing and events manager in July, updating the website and continuing to market towards the Spanish-speaking community.\nShe presented a breakdown of the corporation's funding sources for the 2024 calendar year. 65.4% of funding comes from the Town of Easton, 22.1% comes from grants and 12.5% comes from sponsorships.\nFiscal year 2025 grant funding for the Easton Economic Development Corporation includes, but is not limited to, $300,000 in Project Restore funds and $25,000 in Main Street Improvement Program funds, both from the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development.\nThe latter goes toward marketing, DeKarske said, while the former was awarded to two downtown projects earlier this summer: a Dover Station project to revitalize a former roofing supply center on Dover Street and Dock Street Foundation's project to install a museum and visitor center centered around Frederick Douglass. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Farmers, residents raise safety concerns regarding potential Route 662 closure\n\n August 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 758\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As site preparation is underway for a new regional medical center in Easton, many residents are concerned about the looming closure of Route 662, or Longwoods Road.The University of Maryland Shore Regional Health's new hospital is expected to begin construction in the spring of 2025. Since designs have a corner of the hospital sitting in the middle of existing Route 662, a section of the road is expected to be temporarily closed from Oct. 1 to May 1.\nGreg Gannon, a co-operator of family-owned grain farming operation C.H. Gannon & Sons on Longwoods Road, is not necessarily opposed to the closure. But Gannon said that the closure will \"represent an inconvenience at some level\" to not just the agricultural community, but everyone who uses the road.\n\"Moving large farm equipment and construction equipment these days is dangerous,\" Gannon said.\nInstead of using Route 662, many farmers may have to travel on nearby county-owned roads. Gannon noted the visibility is worse on those county roads compared to Route 662.\nShore Regional Health representatives have stated that delaying construction of the hospital until a new route is complete would present significant financial and time barriers to the project. Hospital construction is estimated to complete in the summer of 2028.\n\"The University of Maryland Shore Regional Health is committed to advancing the health of Mid-Shore residents and the new Regional Medical Center project is one of the most significant developments in the history of Talbot and its surrounding counties,\" Shore Regional said in a statement enailed to the Star Democrat. \"We recognize that building a state-of-the-art hospital to replace an aging and outdated facility may cause inconveniences and have worked tirelessly with state, county and city officials to ensure interruptions to daily activities are minimized. The necessary decision for a temporary closure of Route 662 was made in conjunction with the State Highway Administration, Talbot County officials and the Talbot County Sherriff's Office.\"\nNearly 70 residents wrote to the Talbot County Council in opposition of a bill that acts as a land transfer agreement between the county and Shore Regional, amending old legislation that required Shore Regional to build a new route before closing the current one.\nA request signed by 67 residents asked that the county stick with the original plan that dated back to 2013. Council members voted 4-1 to approve the bill at their most recent meeting, with Council Member Lynn Mielke the sole no vote.\nThe letter presented four main concerns: increased traffic on local county roads, potential backups if there's an emergency situation on U.S. Route 50, effects on farmers who use Route 662 for equipment and access to the Talbot County Community Center.\nWittman resident Mark Marshall, who signed the letter, uses the road to travel to and from work. He believes it'll be a detriment to safety for farmers and residents alike.\n\"It's going to put a hardship on a lot of people who basically depend on that road,\" Marshall said, \"especially on weekends with the traffic and everything going to and from Easton.\"\nAs part of the bill passed Tuesday, the transfer of the land from the county to Shore Regional Health is contingent upon the fulfillment of a road inspection and contribution agreement. That agreement requires Shore Regional Health to contribute to surrounding road work.\nSurrounding county roads — Hailem School Road, Hiners Lane, Airport Road and Goldsborough Neck Road — will all receive paving work this September, County Manager Clay Stamp said. Though that paving is unrelated to the potential Route 662 closure, Stamp said Shore Regional Health will be contributing financially to the effort.\nSince Route 662 is a state road, the Maryland State Highway Administration is responsible for approving its temporary closure and providing an official detour, which is expected to be U.S Route 50.\n\"SHA continues to work with all involved parties and will review the proposed detour plan to ensure it meets standards and provides for a safe alternate route,\" SHA wrote in a statement to The Star Democrat.\nWhile the bill approved by the county facilitates the transfer of the road from the county to Shore Regional Health, the Maryland Board of Public Works first must approve the transfer of the land from the state to the county.\nUpon successful transfers and State Highway Administration approval, the road may be partially closed for drivers come Oct. 1. Marshall, who drives Route 662 nearly every day and sees large farm equipment, is worried for the safety of the operators when that time arrives.\n\"If you have to go down (Route) 50, you're taking your life in your own hands,\" Marshall said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Washington College court win confirms partial demolition of armory will proceed\n\n September 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 591\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Chestertown Historic District Commission's May 1 decision to grant an application to Washington College to partially demolish the John H. Newnam Armory will most likely stand following a judge's ruling Wednesday.Over the summer, the college hit a speed bump in its plan to build a boutique hotel and conference center on the property that once headquartered the National Guard.\nAfter the Historic District Commission's decision, there was a citizen's appeal made to the circuit court by residents Barbara Jorgenson, Tom Kocubinski and Steve Mitchell. They were opposed to the college's plan, favoring restoration over partial demolition.\nBut on Wednesday, with local Judge Harris Murphy recusing himself, visiting Judge Sidney Campen sided with the college.\nCampen's decision came on the grounds that the petitioners didn't have legal standing to make their appeal.\nIn his opening argument, Collin Wojciechowski, an attorney representing the college, brought up a case he said was similar to this one.\nRay v. Mayor and Maryland City Council of Baltimore, he said, had \"striking parallels in this matter.\"\nIn that case, citizens lived within 1,000 feet of the property, but the city still moved to dismiss the case, a move with which the Maryland Supreme Court agreed.\nUnlike in that case, the petitioners, Wojciechowski claimed, can't argue by proximity since none of them live within 1,000 feet of the applicant property.\nHe said other than proximity, the burden of proof for the petitioners is to prove their \"personal or property rights are adversely affected in a way different than the rest of the public.\"\n\"... Petitioners can't show that here. None of the history of the individuals is unique from their neighbors. That uniqueness is needed and Maryland courts have never found it to exist,\" Wojciechowski said.\nNelson rebutted, saying this case was indeed unique.\n\"There's no appellate authority that addresses the question of standing in the historic district,\" Nelson said.\nFurthermore, he said he had actually worked the case referenced by the defense, arguing it in every stage of litigation.\nThat issue, he said, was a zoning decision over a 200,000-square-foot Walmart, not an historic district decision of a building constructed in 1931 in a small town.\nHe firmly disagreed with Wojciechowski. Residents within the Chestertown historical district are the exception, he said, because demolishing and rebuilding will affect the petitioners' taxes, property values and insurance.\nThen pointing to the Historic District Commission guidelines, he read, \"If an owner within the historic district allows a building to fall in disrepair, that adversely affects the character of the district.\"\nAnd again in the guidelines, \"The loss of any contributing historic building diminishes the district and can never be replaced.\"\nNelson said in this situation, the college allowed the building to go into disrepair. Additionally the Historic District Commission then violated guidelines by not issuing a written statement summarizing their decision on May 1, he said.\nCombined with the written testimonies from the petitioners, it proves they should have standing, he said.\nWojciechowski countered, stating this is straightforward case, and the arguments about the Historic District Commission were merit questions, not about standing.\nHe said if the judge allowed this, it would set a precedent encouraging the appeal of Historic District Commission decisions.\nAfter both sides presented their arguments, the judge agreed with Wojciechowski, dismissing the petitioner's claim.\nHe said Nelson did not present enough evidence or case law to show the petitioners would be adversely affected differently than any other resident in the district.\nMike Sosulski, president of the college, said he was satisfied with the judge's decision. \"I think's it's the right result,\" he said. \"While we appreciate our neighbor's position, we're pleased that the project's going forward.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "St. Michaels proposed dog park must find new location\n\n September 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 489\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — The long-desired dog park for St. Michaels has faced yet another barrier in its journey to becoming reality. Friends of St. Michaels Dog Park, a volunteer group advocating for the park, have decided to move away from the proposed Bradley Parks location due to concerns from residents.During the Aug. 14 Commissioners of St. Michaels meeting, members of Friends of St. Michaels Dog Park spoke up and suggested Bradley Park as the location for the future park. According to Mitch Ettinger, the founder of Friends of St. Michaels Dog Park, the one-acre park was \"underutilized\" with few residential homes located nearby and had the added bonus of already being maintained by the town.\nBut last week, St. Michaels residents were sent a message from Ettinger stating the group had requested the commissioners remove the planned dog park discussion from the Sept. 11 meeting.\nEttinger said the decision came after hearing concerns from those living adjacent to Bradley Park. These concerns included noise from barking and the effect the park would have on the property value of their home, Ettinger said.\n\"Quite frankly, I just couldn't see myself standing up and saying, 'disregard these neighbors.' That's not the way that I think. That's not the way that my committee thinks,\" Ettinger said. \"And so we withdrew the proposal for Bradley Park and asked the commissioners to take it off the agenda for this week.\"\nThe effort to have a dog park built in St. Michaels has been ongoing for more than three years. Ettinger said the dog park has been volunteer-led since its origins and is widely supported by residents of the town, according to a survey conducted when an architect was coming up with a master plan for seven acres at San Domingo Park. The site did not work for a dog park due to grant requirements that would prohibit fencing.\nMoving forward, Ettinger said he would like to see commissioners of St. Michaels to take initiative and assist with the finding of a new property.\n\"It's time for the commissioners to step up, and they've been supportive of this concept, but they have yet to propose a location,\" Ettinger said.\nEttinger said his group would continue to work behind the scenes to assist commissioners in picking a location, and currently there are a couple of options that are under consideration.\nDan Conway, a member of Friends of St. Michaels Dog Park, said he and the committee are still committed to the dog park project. For him, it is more than just a place for dogs to run around. It is a community building area and would benefit owners and dogs alike in St. Michaels.\n\"Dog parks aren't really for dogs ... They're for people, and they help make a municipality, a community,\" Conway said. \"In my experience, it's where townspeople can get together and renew acquaintances and make friends and share experiences. And so that, to me, is the beauty of a dog park.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Board of Directors meeting on Wednesday, the board accepted the resignation of board member Dion Banks and accepted appointments from the City of Cambridge for two vacancies.In an interview with the Star Democrat, CWDI Board President Angie Hengst said Gaver Nichols and Natalie Chabot will fill the seats of Banks and former board member Rich Zeidman.\nCambridge City Council President Lajan Cephas said the new board members were the \"best candidates\" for the open seats.\n\"(They are) people who know this community, and they understand it,\" Cephas said. \"And I know they have the best interest at heart.\"\nHengst said both new members have the experience the board was looking for and fill in knowledge gaps on the board. She said Nichols has development and architecture experience and Chabot has a long history with the community.\nNichols, who is an architect, is currently a member of the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeals. Hengst said Nichols will be resigning from that board.\nCephas said Nichols' experience with the Board of Zoning Appeals will give CWDI the advantage of understanding what's expected when it comes to zoning.\n\"That should build an even stronger relationship between the city and CWDI so that they're prepared before they go to the table knowing what will pass and what likely is not going to pass,\" Cephas said.\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat, Nichols said he is proud to be on the board. He said he hopes to see the waterfront become \"an outstanding place to go\" as a local and as someone visiting Cambridge.\nHengst said Chabot is \"invested in the community.\" In her career, Chabot has served as Cambridge's economic development director and Dorchester County's tourism director. She also served on the Sailwinds Park Board for more than a decade.\nCephas said throughout Chabot's career, she has \"always protected the historical fabric of our community.\" Cephas said Chabot is \"well-versed\" when it comes to grant money that is available for development projects.\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat, Chabot said she views the appointment as a great opportunity for herself and for the board. She said she thinks she can bring a lot to the table with her experience and passion.\nChabot said she is looking forward to being a proactive member on the board and seeing significant action on the waterfront.\nZeidman, who was appointed to the board by the city in 2018 and reappointed in 2021, resigned in May. In a May 23 news release from CWDI, Zeidman mentioned the progress that CWDI has made on Cambridge Harbor and his desire to spend his retirement years in actual retirement as reasons for his resignation.\nThat month, amid a lawsuit with the city, CWDI alleged in a court motion that Cambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout had sent a letter to Zeidman in October requesting his resignation from the CWDI board.\nBanks joined the board as a city appointee in 2022. Hengst said in a text message that Banks resigned due to \"increased travel demands in his current position at work,\" which made him unable \"to devote the necessary time to the board.\"\nCephas said she is sure this decision is something Banks thought long and hard about and felt was best, not just for himself, but for CWDI.\n\"That's just the type of person that Dion is,\" she said.\nBanks did not immediately respond for comment.\nThis article may be updated. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A request from the county's public works department to award funds for that temporary relocation was made to Talbot County Council on Tuesday.The request was to award Bates Moving and Storage Company the moving and storage contract for just over $100,000. Council members voted unanimously in favor of the request.\n\"Bates has a lot of experience with moving library collections. They've done a number of libraries on the Eastern Shore as well as media centers,\" Dana Newman, director of Talbot County Free Library, said. \"And they have a special way of packing up library materials so that it's kept in order, and that it's stored in conditions that are okay for storing books over a long period of time.\"\nNewman said the collections will be moved to a temporary location in St. Michaels as renovations are completed. \"It does sound like a lot of funds needed for this, but it is a specialized process, if you can imagine trying to keep about 20,000-plus library materials in strict duodecimal order,\" Newman told the council.\nThe storage will last for around 15 months, during which they will not be available to be checked out. The move will begin around late October. Council members expressed support for the request.\n\"I'm excited that you're getting to the point that you're moving everything,\" Council Member Keasha Haythe said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton, can you spare a dime for a paper bag?\n\n September 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARION O ARNOLD | Section: Columns \n \n 714\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Easton Town Council President Frank Gunsallus has introduced an ordinance aimed at the town's Plastic Bag Law by doing away with the paper bag fee.The law prohibits stores from providing plastic bags and requires retailers to charge a 10-cent fee for paper bags. The fee helps retailers with the higher cost of paper bags. According to Maryland Retailers Association's Sarah Price, who testified at the last Town Council meeting, the 10-cent fee helps level the playing field between retailers allowing them to recover the cost of paper bags for shoppers who take them, reducing overhead and keeping prices lower for all shoppers. It's a fee, not a tax. Retailers keep the fee.\nPaper bags come at an environmental cost, so the 10-cent fee also helps the law from inadvertently substituting one environmental problem with another. Paper bags require trees and a polluting process to make them. Paper bags can be recycled or composted, but most will end up in landfills where they become a source of planet-warming methane gas.\nFor shoppers, the fee makes things more equitable. Those shoppers who take paper bags pay for them. Not having a fee will raise prices on other goods since retailers will have to recoup the increased costs of giving out \"free\" paper bags. Those of us who bring our own bags will end up paying higher prices, even though we won't be using disposable paper bags.\nMost importantly, the 10-cent fee incentivizes shoppers to bring their own bags. It's your choice. You don't have to spend a dime if you bring your reusable bags.\nI think of major environmental laws like the Clean Air and the Clean Water acts. Businesses had to make big investments to meet the demands of the laws or meet up with stiff penalties and fines. Here, with our plastic bag law, we're just asking businesses to charge a small fee for paper bags and to keep every dime they collect.\nWithout the 10-cent fee the law loses a part of its environmental impact. No one is saying let's bring back plastic bags, but if free, paper bags will fly out retailers' doors — and smaller retailers will bear the cost. Laurel, Maryland, passed a bag law in 2022 without a fee. Two years later, they changed their law to add a 10-cent paper bag fee because more than two-thirds of shoppers there just took the free paper bags. Since January, shoppers in Laurel taking paper bags has dropped to 32%.\nEaston's plastic bag law was the result of months of work by a team of town leaders, Easton residents, and community representatives, with encouragement and backing from Talbot watermen, local businesses and environmental organizations. Since then, plastic bags no longer hang from our trees, pile up in hedgerows and ditches, and end up in our waterways. The economic and environmental benefits for Easton are many.\nJeff Harrison, president of the Talbot Watermen Association, was an early supporter of the plastic bag law. He has said, \"We have to understand, whatever we do on the land eventually ends up in the water.\" At the last town council meeting, he testified to the law's success, saying he \"doesn't see bags in the water anymore.\"\nThe law works, and we can readily see the results.\nMr. Gunsallus argued that repealing the 10-cent fee was for those \"who are struggling.\" I have no doubt that people struggle, but no one shopping in Easton is required to pay that 10-cent fee either. There's no fee if you bring your own bag. Bing Crosby's big hit from 1932, \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" came to mind. Back then you could go to a five and dime store and do some damage with that dime in your pocket. You could get two pairs of socks or two cups of coffee. Today, about all you can get for a dime is a brown paper bag.\nMr. Gunsallus does not take into account the greater cost of pollution from paper bags. It affects us, the creatures we share this space with, and causes economic and environmental damage. The 10-cent paper bag fee helps the plastic bag law work. Thanks to our enlightened town leaders, the law is a great success and a benefit to us all. As the old saying goes, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It was finished five months ahead of schedule.\n\"We now have more parking,\" Ironside said. \"The new trail gives easier access to the lighthouse.\"\nTo get that new trail, Park Ranger Shannon Whalen said the original parking lot is now a turnaround for vehicle traffic and another field was used to create the larger lot with 52 parking spots instead of 26. Ironside said residents of the neighboring Chesapeake Isles community will no longer fight with traffic.\n\"Our goal was to alleviate the heavy traffic at Turkey Point Lighthouse,\" she added, noting there is a new route connecting the larger parking lot to the historic lighthouse.\nWhalen said there is now dedicated handicapped parking closer to the lighthouse.\n\"They can drive right up to the lighthouse,\" Whalen said. Handicapped visitors need only call the park ranger at 443-252-4258 and ask for access, which will unlock the gates.\nRepositioning the location of the trail also mitigates erosion issues on the high shore line.\n\"We abandoned the old trail, which will be replanted to stabilize the soil and eliminate erosion,\" Ironside said. \"We will turn that back with native vegetation.\"\nMeanwhile, progress continues on the renovation of the campgrounds at Elk Neck State Park.\n\"We have limited camping for the campground,\" Ironside said. \"A lot of loops are being shut down.\"\nIt reduces the available spaces from 300 to 76. Only two loops will remain open plus the youth group camp.\n\"The beach and Rogues Harbor will remain open throughout,\" she added. So will Turkey Point Lighthouse.\nWhalen said the work to address parking made slight changes to the trail.\n\"It's the same loop but now it's .8 miles instead of 1.2,\" Whalen said. \"And we have port-a-johns in the parking lot.\"\nTurkey Point Lighthouse will be open every weekend in October from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. for tours. The park itself is open seven days per week from 7 a.m. until sunset. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

During the Sept. 10 meeting, Bell said the purpose of the policy \"is to create an atmosphere where the elected officials, staff and members of the public can attend to business efficiently, fairly and with full participation.\"\nSpecifically, the policy limits when and for how long public commenters can speak and prohibits heckling, defamatory comments and profanity. The resolution also makes it so commissioners do not have to answer questions residents ask during public comment.\nThe different limitations, as well as the way in which the resolution was passed, drew concern from residents.\nBoth Bell and Commissioner Tom Costigan said during the discussion that the commissioners had been receiving responses from residents regarding Bell's proposed resolution since the previous town meeting when it was introduced.\nCommissioner Katrina Greer — who voted against passing the resolution — brought up the town's charter, which says, \"the rules of the commissioners shall provide that residents of the town shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard at any meeting in regard to any municipal question.\"\nGreer said she is proposing a different resolution, which hadn't yet been posted on the town website prior to Tuesday's meeting. Greer said she wanted to schedule a workshop, gather input and put together one merged resolution to vote on.\n\"There is a need, and most towns have it, for a little bit of rules,\" she said. \"But this is something that the town needs to participate in and see the documents.\"\nGreer said that unlike Bell's proposal that restricts public comment to the end of a meeting, hers would allow for public comment before actionable items, or items that are voted on.\n\"Letting people talk at the end of the meeting about something that has already been voted on is useless and does not satisfy the requirement for a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the meeting,\" she said. \"It is also dismissive of the right of citizens to participate.\"\nTensions rose throughout the discussion, which public comment was not allowed during. At one point, one resident asked the commissioners, \"Are you really not going to allow public comment on this?\"\nBell responded that the commissioners had received feedback prior meeting. When another resident spoke up, Bell said, \"Excuse me, there will not be back talk. Please.\"\nAt another point, when resident Susan Kordell started to make a comment, Bell banged his gavel and told her to \"sit down, please.\"\nAt the end of the meeting, Bell said he acted \"quickly\" to try to stop commenters due to concerns about the commissioners' time to discuss the matter at hand.\nAlthough Greer felt the commissioners should not vote on meeting procedures Tuesday evening, both Costigan and Bell said they were ready to vote.\n\"It's a resolution, and if there are any amendments to it, we can certainly address them in the two weeks, and we (can) vote on any amendments or changes or adoption of one over the other,\" Bell said.\nAlong with approving Bell's proposed resolution, Bell and Costigan agreed to schedule a workshop on the topic for next week so at the next town meeting, the commissioners can consider any amendments that might be suggested.\nAt the end of the meeting, resident Emilie Knud-Hansen said she though thought the procedure around the resolution at the meeting was unfair.\n\"We deserve to find out what you're voting on before you say, 'We'll vote on this resolution and then we'll deal with amendments,'\" she said. \"I think that's really backwards.\"\nResident Dave Donovan said at the end of the meeting that there was irony in the fact that a resolution on public comment \"was itself enacted without public comment.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County landowners offer different perspectives on expanding solar\n\n October 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 575\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Converting Caroline County land into solar is a contentious issue.Some landowners see a chance to repurpose their land, add to the tax base and make some money. Others think it is against the rural character of the county.\nDave Tribbet owns farmland in Ridgely. He said he has been approached a couple of times by solar companies, and he has declined their offers.\n\"If you are taking up farmland, is solar going to feed anybody? I don't like solar. I am an adamant farmer who believes in feeding people,\" Tribbett said.\nBut he acknowledges that not all farmers in the county take the same stance on the issue as he does. He said he sees some landowners going for solar, attracted by the stable profits that farming can't always provide.\n\"A lot of the younger generations that inherited farms, that did not do the work, the backbone of the farm, to really appreciate the farm, and they see the money that is offered them. They are the ones probably jumping in on that,\" Tribbett said. \"There is less risk, and they are guaranteed the pay at the end of the day.\"\nAnother farmer, Jim Lewis, sold 200 acres, a part of his farm, to Enel, a multinational corporation, for the Waypost Solar Project. It is near Templeville and Marydel.\nEnel claims it will supply carbon-free electricity to 15,000 homes with this project. The company bought land from nine landowners and have 550 panel acres.\n\"I am not one to say 'everything is for sale,' but at the right price 'everything is for sale.' They offered 1.5 times my land's value. The piece of land was not the best farmland that I farmed. If I can trade one piece of land and walk away with some money, then I essentially doubled the size of the land that I had by doing it,\" Lewis said.\n\"If I can make $1,000 an acre with solar, and I can only make $100 growing corn or soy beans, it is back to economics,\" Lewis said. He later added that because he is making more money off the land, more of his income can be collected in taxes.\nSolar relies on the transmission lines in Caroline County, which are used to move the energy. If land is not adjacent to the lines, it isn't as useful to solar companies.\nThe county government has put a cap of 2,000 acres that are available for solar development. Most of those acres have been developed already.\nDecommissioning, the process of dismantling the solar panels and steel posts at the end of their lives, has county leadership worried that solar will leave an eyesore that is hard to get rid of.\nLewis said that solar companies have told him that when 20 years go by, they will take the panels because they are valuable.\n\"If they leave me a farm that has steel stakes that the panels were on, I can with a mini excavator with a thumb and a roll off can, I can clean up 20 or 30 acres a day and make it back into ag productive land,\" Lewis said.\nBut Lewis said he can see the aesthetic downside. And he can see if you are a farmer that rents land, that solar is competition.\n\"The commissioners shouldn't care about people's private business deals,\" Lewis said.\nAt a council meeting Commissioner Larry Porter said, \"This is a fight that we better gear up for. I am not going to see this county covered in solar.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This portion is expected to be the most expensive due to the marshy area and many trees to be removed.\nPhase 5 entails the Thompson Creek and is seeking design and funding with funding needed for the construction of the road.\nPhase 6 involves U.S. Route 50/301 overpass crossing.\nThere are three potential locations for crossing that take into account county-owned property or easements, Cohoon said.\nA key aspect of the project moving forward will be a required feasibility study by the State Highway Administration to determine where the best crossing location would be and where connections to existing trails systems can be made, he said.\nThis study will take into account future plans including bay crossing and the widening of Route 50.\nThe department is currently seeking grant funds for the approximately $120,000 to $150,000 feasibility study, Cohoon said.\nA timeframe for completion is undetermined at this point as the different potential locations may have different impacts, he said.\nMany of the construction aspects are weather dependent, he said.\nProgress also is developing on the Cross County Connector Trail Extension, according to Cohoon. Queen Anne's County received $80,000 from the Baltimore Regional Transportation Board through the adoption of the 2024 Pedestrian and Bicycle Master Plan earlier this year. This grant is to conduct a feasibility study to extend the Cross County Connector Trail from Long Point Park to the Nesbit Road overpass by 2.8 miles.\nThis study includes feasibility of pedestrian and bike facilities on existing overpasses crossing U.S. 50/301 at Chester River Beach Road and Nesbit Road, Cohoon said. Work is underway with RK and K Civil Engineering as the consultant for this portion and is expected to be completed by the end of the year, he said.\n\"The ultimate goal with any of these crossings is to connect the South Island Trail with the Cross Island Trail. That's been a long-standing goal for many, many years for the county,\" Cohoon said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If they miss the second one, they can catch the third one.\"\nRichard Osborne, chair of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee, said it's important for everyone to vote and encourage those that they know to do so as well. He said a benefit of early voting is avoiding a situation on Election Day where results begin to trickle in while polls are still open.\n\"The reason why you want to do that is because if you wait until the last day and you see maybe elections lost, it might discourage you from voting,\" Osborne said.\nAcross Maryland, more than 150,000 people participated in early voting during the presidential primary election in May.\nIn Talbot County, 7.08% of eligible active voters voted early, tied for the highest percentage of any county with Kent. In Caroline and Dorchester, 4.43% and 4.1% of voters participated in early voting, respectively.\nAt a Sept. 14 rally in Denton, local Republican politicians gathered to campaign in front of Caroline County voters. During the event, many calls for early voting surfaced.\nFirst District Congressman Andy Harris (R-Md.), the featured speaker at the event, asked attendees to vote early for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said the same.\n\"You need your vote in the bank,\" Harris said. \"You must bank your vote.\"\n\"It's incredibly important,\" he continued. \"We have to beat the Democrats at their game, and their game is voting before Election Day.\"\nChairs of local central committees, such as Talbot's Democratic Committee Chair Patrick Firth are noting that the unexpected can happen on Election Day, such as long lines, car troubles or work emergencies.\nFirth said all voters should make a plan, emphasizing the security and efficiency of not just early voting days, but mail-in ballots.\n\"Sometimes the easiest way to make sure that your voice is heard is get it done along the way,\" Firth said. \"And that's what's so efficient and common sense about participating in the election via the mail-in ballots.\"\nJulie Quick, chair of the Caroline County Republican Central Committee, said her team is emphasizing to voters the multitude of voting options in the first post-COVID general election cycle.\n\"I think a lot of people here are so used to voting in person, and we just really want to raise awareness that there are so many options,\" Quick said.\nGeneral election early voting in Maryland begins Oct. 24 and runs through Oct. 31. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

At the time, the board's breakdown of judges was 62 Democratic, 50 Republican and 11 unaffiliated.\nAt Tuesday's meeting, Stepp said the difference between Democratic and Republican judges had lowered to seven. \"I ask that we keep up that work,\" Stepp said.\nHe also thanked Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble for sending a letter to the Board of Elections and Election Director Tammy Stafford last week. In that letter, Gamble \"strongly\" urged the board to follow state election law.\nCouncil Member Lynn Mielke, as she did on Sept. 24, disagreed with Stepp. She brought up a letter written by Attorney General Anthony Brown that was sent to Gamble on Monday.\nIn that letter, Brown addressed the \"limited role of local law enforcement … in the electoral process.\" While not an official opinion of the attorney general, Brown said achieving \"exact party balance\" isn't always possible for local election boards due to volunteer rates, training and no-shows on Election Day.\n\"My Office has consistently advised that opening a polling place, even if the number of judges from each party is not exactly equal, is preferable to closing the polling place and disenfranchising all the voters who would have voted there,\" Brown wrote in his letter.\nMielke said Tuesday, \"We have rulings from the attorney general that the procedure that was started by (Council Member) Stepp and others, were overruled … And that there was nothing found … that the local board of elections have done wrong.\"\nZONING WAIVERCouncil members unanimously approved a zoning change waiver for around 17 acres of land off of U.S. Route 50 that developers aim to use for an affordable multifamily housing project in Easton.\nThe development on the east side of Ocean Gateway is planned by developers Corrigan & Trippe Ventures. Easton Town Council approved the annexation of the land in July.\nThe resolution passed Tuesday approves a waiver that will allow a proposed zoning change to take immediate effect without a five-year hold. The area will be rezoned from the county's town conservation zoning to the town's residential zoning, providing developers with a higher approved density.\n\"They would essentially be locked into the uses that are permitted under the county's TC zoning now for a period of five years,\" County Attorney Patrick Thomas said if the waiver was not passed.\nZach Smith, an attorney representing the developers, said the maximum density under the town's residential zoning is 3.5 units per acre, along with a 5-unit-per-acre mark permitted by the town's multifamily housing special exception.\nIf developers plan to exceed those marks, they will have to come before the Easton Town Council for a planned unit development approval. Smith noted developers would then need to revisit the County Council for a supplemental waiver.\nSmith emphasized to council members that while developers are obligated within the annexation agreement to reach a 50% mark of affordable units, the goal is for 100% of the units to be affordable.\n\"This housing is not necessarily housing designed to attract new folks to our community, it's really to serve folks that are already in our community,\" Smith said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ryan Anthony of the Cambridge Spy, Sharon Smith of the Cambridge Association of Neighborhoods, Jim Johnson of the Dorchester Star and Jim Brady of WHCP moderated the forum.\nWard 2 candidate Jenna LeCompte, Ward 4 candidate Dave Cannon, Ward 3 candidate Frank Stout and Ward 5 candidate Brian Roche — who is running uncontested — were not at the event.\nIn an email to WHCP on Friday, LeCompte said she is \"taking a step back\" from her campaign and would not be at the event. She did not respond to requests for clarification from the Star Democrat on what that means.\nMAYORAL FORUM\nSandwiched between two commissioner candidate sessions, the mayoral forum gave candidates Lajan Cephas, Andrew Bradshaw and La-Shon Banks-Foster the opportunity to share their perspectives on an array of Cambridge issues, from the waterfront, to revitalizing the city's downtown, to race relations.\nDuring the session, candidates were asked whether the city should get more involved in Dorchester County Public Schools, which is one of Maryland's lowest ranked school systems.\nBradshaw said he would like to implement a mentorship program, which would reach across racial and socioeconomic lines, and encourage the Board of Education to implement a charter school program. He said charter schools across the state tend to perform at the state average, which is \"significantly better\" than Dorchester schools.\n\"And they are only located in counties and jurisdictions with poor performance,\" he said, \"so there's corollaries where they can succeed in places like Cambridge.\"\nFoster, who attended the forum virtually, said every graduate from Dorchester County high schools is a county resident and could be a Cambridge resident.\n\"We cannot ignore the fact that whoever graduates from either of the schools that I mentioned can and will impact the City of Cambridge, and we must have an active role,\" she said.\nCephas said it is important for the city to be \"extremely supportive\" of the county, but there is no need to \"reinvent the wheel.\" She said there are nonprofits already in place to address education concerns.\n\"So it's extremely important that we understand what's already in place, support those nonprofits that are already in place, and each of us just pick up a book and read to someone,\" she said.\nCOMMISSIONER FORUMS\nThe seven commissioner candidates at the forum were split into two groups. All commissioner candidates were asked the same questions from the moderators.\nKicking off the event were Ward 1 candidates Brett Summers and Laurel Atkiss, as well as Ward 3 candidate Gary Gordy. Ward 2 candidates Jermaine Anderson, Shay Lewis-Sisco and Nancy Jackson, as well as Ward 4 candidate Sputty Cephas, closed out the event.\nWhen asked about code enforcement and overall housing quality in the city, Summers said hiring tenant advocates to promote a tenants bill of rights would be beneficial.\n\"Because if the tenants feel like they can contact the city inspector and have them come out without fear of getting evicted or some other kind of retribution, then the tenants are empowered to improve our housing stock,\" he said.\nAtkiss said the city has implemented a software system to make it easier to enforce things like building code violations. She said Cambridge is doing city-wide building inspections and recently hired a new code enforcement officer.\n\"We've invested money, we've invested time,\" she said, \"and now we're going to invest the manpower, and we're going to start to see some results that I hope everybody's going to be really happy with.\"\nLewis-Sisco said code enforcement should strategically target houses where renters are living in deplorable conditions. She said community engagement should also be a focus.\n\"So that when code enforcement officers go out to a homeowner or a property, they are able to offer those additional supports or let them know what additional resources exist,\" she said.\nThe issue of addressing crime in Cambridge was also brought up during the forum.\nGordy said improved lighting, more cameras and more monitoring of those cameras are needed in the city's \"hot spots\" in order to lower crime rates. When talking about monitoring cameras, he brought up a shooting that occurred over the weekend.\n\"Because last night police got there so fast, but they couldn't see who it was,\" he said about the need for 24-hour camera monitoring.\nJackson said addressing the issue of crime in Cambridge might start with more than detaining people. She said she would work to help resolve those problems if elected.\n\"There is something deep where this person is committing these acts,\" she said. \"It could be the home life or it could be the environment.\"\nCephas said strengthening the police department's community policing division is important. He talked about programming for youth to attract \"local and diverse talent\" as another solution.\n\"Let's do a cadet program to get some of these young people before they get out into the community and do wrong things or bad things,\" he said.\nAnderson said these problems have existed for a long time and won't be a quick fix. He stressed the importance of being proactive and communicating.\nWhen asked about the greatest threat to the city, both Atkiss and Anderson talked about the city standing in it's own way.\n\"But the biggest opportunity is imagine if we get out of our own way,\" Anderson said. \"Think about the opportunity that would pose for this city ... how much of a difference that would make.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Changes made to St. Michaels Tourism Advisory Board\n\n October 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 534\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — The Commissioners of St. Michaels have made changes to the controversial Tourism Advisory Board, including additional members and updated language.According to Commissioner David Wojciechowski at a Wednesday meeting, the ordinance establishing the board was \"re-drafted\" to take into consideration comments from the commissioners and the public.\nThe idea of a tourism board was brought forth during the town election last May. Wojciechowski, Alexis Roiter and Jay Hudson, who were all later elected as commissioners, said during their campaigns that they would work with business owners to make the town more friendly to their needs.\nThe purpose of the board, according to a town memo, would be to assist the town in its efforts to encourage businesses to locate or remain in the town and to make recommendations to the commissioners. The board would also \"work closely with the Talbot County Tourism Board on a unified, regional marketing approach.\"\nDuring an August commission meeting, the proposed tourism board was met with pushback from residents, who raised an array of concerns about potential conflicts of interest and a lack of data supporting the board's creation.\nA major change to the ordinance Wojciechowski pointed out was a change in language. For the purpose of the board, language was changed to \"manage, promote and stabilize the economic health of the town's tourism economy.\"\n\"One of the objectives here is to stabilize tourism, to make it to the right size, if you will. Not too large for the town, not too small, but to manage tourism doesn't get out of hand,\" Wojciechowski said.\nAdditionally, there were changes to the amount of members on the board. Originally, the board would comprise seven members serving four-year terms, all appointed by the commissioners. Membership would include a resident not associated with a business and representatives from the lodging, eating/drinking, retail or service, marinas, museums and nonprofit sectors.\nThere was outcry by residents over the low number of residents on the board. Now membership has been changed to include two town residents.\nPublic CommentDuring public comment, resident Daniel Spiegel, who in the past has shared concerns over the establishment of the tourism board, said he and other residents have marked issues with what he describes as a \"seriously flawed ordinance.\"\nSpiegel's main concerns involved potential conflicts of interest and the town's level of involvement in private business operations and gathering data. He stressed there are already small business associations, such as the lodging association, which could gather the necessary information that the tourism board would gather.\nAccording to Spiegel, by creating a government board rather than an advisory board outside of the town's legal boundaries, it will create conflict of interests where the business owners on the board could propose budgetary expenditures that could directly benefit them.\n\"There's nothing wrong with promoting tourism,\" Spiegel said. \"The question is whether the town wants to be deeply engaged in the way that this ordinance is. Which for a town of (this) size, is really surprising. We're not a county, we're not a big city, we're a small town, and I think you will regret that you've set it up this way.\"\nAfter public comment, the board unanimously approved moving the ordinance toward a public hearing. The hearing will be held on Nov. 13. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Idlewild Park's cherished tile wall to remain up until the spring\n\n October 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 572\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Town of Easton's plans to tear down an Idlewild Park walkway adorned with hand-painted tiles has brought back cherished memories for many Easton residents.Like many others, Easton resident Michael McCormack remembers painting his tile around 17 years ago. He was eight years old, and it included trees and grass, which fit with his then-involvement in Boy Scouts and camping outdoors.\nHis tile is one of hundreds that make up a winding path next to the playground at Idlewild Park — some include handprints, names or school classes. While the tiles remain, they are weathered and damaged from the time that's passed.\nAfter the town initially announced on Sept. 25 that the tile walkway would be taken down in October, many town residents asked to retrieve their tiles, with others suggesting a new community art project go in its place.\nThe town has said the tiles have too much wear and tear to be retrieved without damaging the wall entirely. But the outpouring of community input led town officials to delay the removal of the tiles to the spring of 2025.\n\"It has been truly heartwarming to see all of the community response regarding the tile wall at Idlewild Park,\" the town wrote in a Facebook post on Sept. 27. \" … Hopefully this way everyone who wishes to visit will have a little more time to make the trip and take photos before the tiles are gone.\"\nMcCormack said he's reconnected with old friends in recent weeks after going to Idlewild Park to look at the tiles.\n\"You bring back these memories that aren't necessarily attached to the tile, but they're attached to the person,\" McCormack said. \"Just seeing their name and seeing what they did makes you laugh.\"\nMayor Megan Cook was a driving force behind Idlewild Park's construction in 2006. As co-chairman of Project Idlewild at the time, Cook helped spearhead a community-led effort to fund and build the park that opened in the summer of 2007.\n\"The whole thing from start to finish was a massive undertaking with so many volunteers,\" Cook said, \"and then so many people came to build it over a two-week period.\"\nCook said hundreds of people showed up to help construct the park. There was even a dedicated team in charge of watching over the kids so parents could come chip in.\nThe hand-painted tiles cemented the park as a community-driven project, the mayor said.\n\"The hope had always been that, as a community project, … there would always be that link back in community,\" Cook said.\nShe said the town is considering ideas to incorporate the tiles into a new design once the tile wall is taken down. The town's Parks & Recreation department is \"all ears\" on ideas from residents, it said in a Facebook post.\nMcCormack hopes to see the piece of Easton history commemorated, even if all of the tiles cannot be saved.\n\"It would be cool to save the ones they can,\" McCormack said. \"People my age are starting to have kids, so it'd almost be cool to have their kids paint it. And then you could connect two generations together out there.\"\n\"You can see the weather, you can see the time has taken its toll on those things for sure,\" he said. \"So you can see why they need to be taken down. It's just one of those things that I don't think people in the town really appreciated until they realized it was going to be gone.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Property owners learn about potential compensation for Rails to Trails\n\n October 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n HURLOCK — Landowners with property adjacent to future Rails to Trails projects may be entitled to compensation, according to attorneys from Missouri-based law firm Lewis Rice.The law firm is representing about a dozen Mid-Shore residents who have signed onto a lawsuit seeking compensation from the federal government for potential trail projects.\nA handful of people sat in the Unity-Washington United Methodist Church on the evening of Oct. 14 to learn about what this effort looks like in Dorchester County.\nThe county is in the process of obtaining the rights of way for rail lines from Preston to Hurlock and Linkwood to Cambridge. When the state grants them these rights of way, the county will be able to implement Rails to Trails on those pathways.\nIn an interview Tuesday, Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said the county has no immediate plans to implement Rails to Trails in those places. He said the county hasn't even started to discuss implementation and would need to seek public input first.\n\"It would be a community process,\" he said. \"And again, we don't have any money to do anything like that. So it's nothing that's going to happen in the near future.\"\nBut during the event at Unity-Washington United Methodist Church, attorneys gave a presentation to inform landowners with property adjacent to the rail lines about potential compensation from the federal government.\nAttorney Meghan Largent led the presentation, which detailed the process of making a claim. She said neither the government, nor the railroads, nor the trail groups involved are required to notify landowners when a certificate of interim trail use is issued by the Surface Transportation Board.\n\"We have challenged that,\" Largent said. \"What the courts have found is that publishing it in the federal register is effective notice.\"\nLargent said landowners usually don't know what's happening or what their legal rights are until lawyers show up.\nPfeffer said in an interview that in this particular situation, the state had made notice of the easements, but he was unsure of the exact status. He said his understanding is that the state published a press release and then law firms directly contacted property owners of land adjoining the rail lines.\nLargent said that once the certificate of interim trail use was issued on Aug. 30 for this potential project, it triggered a six-year statute of limitations. This means property owners have six years to file a claim for compensation. She said that although six years seems like a long time, it can sneak up quickly.\nLargent said that within a week of the issuance of the certificate, Lewis Rice filed a lawsuit seeking this compensation for residents. The U.S. Department of Justice has 60 days from the filing of the lawsuit to answer.\nLewis Rice is currently representing about a dozen local property owners, but there are more than 50 property owners who they believe have a good claim. Largent said they have sent mail to property owners who they believe will be successful in receiving a claim.\n\"We do have to follow the solicitation rules in the state, which require us to market as an advertisement,\" she said in an interview. \"So, whether everybody got that information, I can't confirm, but we certainly sent it.\"\nCurrently, Lewis Rice can still add landowners to the lawsuit. Largent said she doesn't have an exact date that this period of adding landowners will end. She said that if property owners don't file a claim, they won't be compensated.\n\"It's not a class action,\" she said. \"Government's not going to reach out to them and offer them money.\"\nAfter the presentation, one resident said he appreciated the attorneys reaching out because neither the federal government nor county government notified him of the turning over of rights of way.\nLargent said she wanted to make it clear that Lewis Rice wasn't there to advocate for or against the trail. She said compensation to property owners doesn't mean less funding for the trail.\n\"We might have clients that love the trail,\" she said. \"We might have clients that really dislike the idea of a trail. Some that are ambivalent. But that's not what we're here to do. They'll be hosting the trail through their property, and they should be compensated.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Local officials have indicated at meetings that the number of judges for each party may now be closer to equal, but this has not been confirmed by the Board of Elections.\nElection officials have said the makeup is \"fluid\" and will change up until Election Day. During Wednesday's meeting, Stafford said \"judges are always needed\" and that her office \"continuously\" accepts interest forms.\nAccording to Sept. 18 meeting minutes read aloud Wednesday, staffing for the election began in June of 2023. Training for those who filled out interest forms began in early 2024.\nIn the last month, concerns have circulated regarding a party imbalance of election judges, or those who staff polling places on Election Day.\nLocal officials, including Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble and Talbot County Council Member Dave Stepp, have cited that the board is not in compliance with state law.\nMaryland election code states \"each polling place shall have an equal number of election judges\" from \"the majority party\" and \"the principal minority party.\"\nState election law permits judges not affiliated with either party for precincts with six or more judges, as well as \"one or more election judges who are minors.\" The number of unaffiliated judges \"may not exceed the lesser of\" the majority or minority party, law states.\nThese concerns led to a flurry of responses from state agencies emphasizing the security of the electoral process. In an Oct. 2 statement responding to a letter sent by Gamble to the Talbot Board of Elections, State Board of Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis said voters should feel \"confident\" in the state's election security and \"compliance with the law.\"\nAttorney General Anthony Brown weighed in as well, writing a letter to Gamble on Oct. 7.\n\"Even at the individual polling place level, while all local boards make best efforts to achieve exact party balance, this is not always possible for reasons outside the local board's control, including the number of judges from each party who volunteer,\" Brown wrote.\nStafford stated at the Sept. 18 meeting that the training for election judges can no longer be done after Oct. 8 since the room used for training is also used for canvassing.\nDuring Wednesday's public comment, Gary Judy, a member of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee, said he's heard from Republicans who applied to be an election judge but were not told there are no vacancies for this year's general election. He said the fact that the board did not achieve exact party balance is \"extremely alarming to Talbot County voters.\"\n\"We decided to keep close track on it this year,\" Judy said, \"and can confirm that there were more than enough Republicans who signed up to be election judges to fill the available Republican positions of the equal representation required by Maryland election law.\"\nOn Wednesday, Judy provided board members with copies of a letter written by the Maryland Republican Party addressing election judge concerns in Talbot County. Adam Wood, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, later told the Star Democrat that the letter was a \"draft\" letter and had not been sent to the state board.\nShari Wilcoxon, also a member of the Republican central committee, spoke during public comment, asking the board to ensure \"parity\" of election judges.\n\"I think that it is an actual embarrassment that this board is allowing the executive director free rein to break the law,\" Wilcoxon said. \"It is your duty to hold her feet to the fire, and that she does what is Maryland law.\"\nWilcoxon questioned why election judge applications were denied in February and March.\n\"February and March had to do with the primary,\" Stafford responded. \"Let's be specific here. That was the primary. Those were the first people who were contacted for the general (election).\"\nThis led to tense back-and-forth between Wilcoxon and Stafford.\nBoard President Susan MacKinnon stepped in, asking Wilcoxon to stop speaking.\n\"You have had the opportunity to speak, you are now being disruptive,\" MacKinnon said to Wilcoxon. \"You are being disruptive, and if you continue being disruptive, I will call a recess and have you removed.\"\nWednesday's meeting was the board's last regularly scheduled meeting before the election Nov. 5. During Stafford's report to the board, she said \"logic and accuracy testing on the electronic equipment was completed\" on Sept. 16. The Board of Elections will have its logic and accuracy testing documentation available for public inspection Friday at 10 a.m. at 215 Bay Street in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The current Denton jail holds 130 inmates.\nThe warden of the Caroline County Detention Center, Charles Scott, said there are mental health needs among the inmates that could be better managed with a designated space, which could be incorporated into the design of the new facility.\n\"There should be a wing just for mental health. Juveniles and mental health are just piling up in the jail,\" Scott said.\nHe said there is plenty of land in Queen Anne's County to build this new detention center. The new facility will be located in Church Hill on the site of the Eastern Pre-Release Unit.\nCommission President Travis Breeding cited the economies of scale and how the new detention center could serve the needs of the counties for less money.\nThe commissioners discussed who would be the authority on this tri-county project. Right now, one county commissioner and one county administrator oversee the jail in Denton. The commissioners said they wanted more clarity on how that would work in a tri-county context.\nThe commissioners also discussed the employment possibilities for current Caroline County Detention Center employees. Employment decisions would factor in tenure and managing workers who have fulfilled this amount of time as they work in a new county.\nScott said it is hard to find correctional officers, so everyone's job should be safe.\nCounty Administrator Katheleen Freeman said the new facility will offer better services at lower costs, but the devil is in the details.\nThe commissioners agreed to discuss this further at the next meeting on Oct. 22 at the Health and Public Services building. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Cambridge Assistant City Manager Brandon Hesson said there are 8,982 active registered voters in Cambridge.\nHesson said the number of registered voters in Cambridge is an \"incredible amount.\" He said it is important they vote for their preferred candidates.\n\"Every other Monday is a council meeting where important decisions are made,\" he said. \"And the residents are going to want people in those seats that represent them and their thoughts on where this community should and shouldn't be going.\"\nMAYORAL RACECambridge Commission President Lajan Cephas and former Cambridge Mayor Andrew Bradshaw will go head to head in a runoff election to determine the city's next mayor.\nCephas received 637 votes Saturday, or 42.52% of the vote.

It's a good feeling to know we are going in the right direction.\"\nCephas said now it is a matter of making reconnections with voters.\nBradshaw said he is confident going into the runoff, but he knows Cephas is a \"very solid candidate as well.\" He said that now, the voters will be able to directly compare him and Cephas.\n\"We can talk about policy versus a lack of policy direction,\" he said. \"And we're in a position where we can now contrast the candidates for people in a really direct way.\"\nFormer Cambridge Commissioner La-Shon Foster, who also ran in the race, received 247 votes, or 16.49% of the vote.\nThe run-off election will be held on Dec. 3 at 447 Race Street. The candidate that secures the most votes in the run-off election will take Mayor Stephen Rideout's seat.\nIn June, Rideout said he would not be running for reelection.

Stout received 191 votes, or 73.46% of the vote.\nGary Gordy received 69 votes, or 26.54% of the vote.\nStout said he is \"very thankful\" for the support he's received and he is looking forward to representing Ward 3 and the city to his \"fullest and best ability.\" He said he's also looking forward to serving with the other elected commissioners.\n\"I'm really thankful for the total outcome,\" he said about the election. \"I think there's a great group to work with.\"\nJameson Harrington is the current Ward 3 commissioner.

He said he likes to volunteer and help, but politics is \"just not my forte.\"\nWARD 4Incumbent Commissioner Sputty Cephas took the city's Ward 4 commissioner seat. Cephas received 144 votes, or 54.14% of the vote. Sputty Cephas has served as commissioner since 2021.\nSputty Cephas said he's excited to be able to \"continue forward\" as commissioner of Ward 4.\n\"I definitely felt that my work wasn't complete,\" he said. \"And I'm grateful to the citizens and constituents of the fourth ward that they agreed and that they have reelected me for another term.\"\nHe said he's looking forward to continuing to engage the city's youth, continuing to move the city forward and continuing to unify the city.\nFormer Commissioner Dave Cannon received 122 votes, or 45.86% of the vote.\nWARD 5With no other candidates on the ballot, incumbent Commissioner Brian Roche will keep his Ward 5 commission seat. Roche received 158 votes.\nIn a text, Roche said moving into the next term, he hopes the newly elected mayor and commissioners will understand \"how to truly raise the quality of life\" for Cambridge's underserved.\n\"I've seen first hand how Cambridge has become so dependent on government transfer payments to survive... we often fail to put these programs through the filter of 'will this lift us out of poverty' or 'will it finally empower our citizens to build generational wealth?'\" he said.\nRoche was elected as commissioner of the ward in June 2023 in a special election to finish the unexpired term of former Commissioner Chad Malkus. Before that, Roche served as commissioner of Ward 1, which he was sworn into in 2021. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He stated upwards of 500 jobs and more than $91 million in business revenue stems from the Easton Airport.\nHe added that the state is providing $560,000 in grant assistance to Easton Airport this year.\nAfter thanking state officials for their updates and assistance to the county, Council Vice President Pete Lesher asked Pines about improvements at Route 322 and Glenwood Avenue in Easton. That project was listed for potential deferral by the state.\n\"I know that our partners at Easton are looking forward to that project as part of the rail-trail safety,\" Lesher said. \" … I just wanted to ask about the likelihood of that and whether that might be reconsidered.\"\nPines said that the state is \"evaluating\" that project and others to see if they fit within the Federal Highway Administration's Highway Safety Improvement Program. If so, federal funding could be unlocked, but if not, that Glenwood Avenue project would have to \"compete it out against many other projects that need the state funding,\" Pines said.\n\"This very well could be a great candidate, it just has to go through the more detailed evaluation for us to confirm,\" he said.\nCouncil President Chuck Callahan thanked Wiedefeld, Pines and District 2 Engineer Ken Fender for their help in improving safety at the airport and its surrounding roads. \"It's those little things that mean a lot to us, and we really appreciate it,\" Callahan said.\nCallahan added that he's grateful for the state's partnership in facilitating the temporary closure of a portion of Route 662, which is allowing construction of the University of Maryland Shore Regional Health's new hospital. Route 662's partial closure began earlier this month. The road will reopen in May.\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) was in attendance, and echoed the same about the hospital, saying it's going to \"have a huge impact on transportation in the county.\" Mautz encouraged the County Council to stay on top of transportation challenges in the coming year.\n\"I think we're going to have some challenges,\" Mautz said, \"and I just would urge the council and the town to communicate with MDOT and hopefully MDOT will be looking for that communication.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Members of the Maryland Department of Transportation shared an annual presentation that included various infrastructure projects and funding challenges.Representatives from MDOT, Maryland Aviation Administration, Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration, Maryland Transit Administration, Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration and Maryland Transportation Authority shared information affecting local transportation as well as statewide transportation.\nLOCALWill Pines, administrator for the State Highway Administration, shared various transportation projects in Caroline County, both pending and completed.\n\"We understand the fiscal challenges Maryland is facing,\" Pines said. \"However, I want to assure you of two things. First, SHA will continue to do big things moving forward, multimodal projects that improve safety, and accessibility and equity. And second, safety will always be our highest priority.\"\nAccording to Pines, the newly constructed bridge on Maryland 16 over Mill Creek was reopened to traffic in September.\nAdditionally, Pines said two county priorities are the focal point of the fall. The first is the construction of pavement widening and signalization upgrades to provide a dedicated left turn lane from Maryland 328 to Maryland 404. This $2.1 million project is anticipated to be completed near the end of 2025.\nThe second is the conversion of the flashing signals at Maryland 313 and Maryland 317 to full color signals. This improvement will facilitate safer traffic movements at the intersection.\nSHA hosted the second public meeting for the Maryland 404 Planning and Environmental Linkage Study. The meeting was well attended, according to Pines, and the study is anticipated to be completed by the end of the year. Once completed, SHA will work with Caroline County to identify potential breakout projects along the corridor, pending available funding.\nSHA has begun a pipe replacement project on Maryland 328, near Salisbury Road. Construction crews will work daytime hours this week for site preparation, then switch to overnight hours to minimize the impacts to traffic.\nTravis Johnston, local transit support director for Maryland Transit Administration, said MTA provides nearly $1 million in operating and capital grants to support local transit operations provided by Delmarva Community Transit in conjunction with Kent and Talbot counties. In addition to continued preventative maintenance, the funds will also provide one new small bus.\nEarlier this month, Gov. Wes Moore announced additional grant funding to the county aimed at helping the Caroline County Sheriff's Office and the Denton Police Department address speed impairment and aggressive driving.\nFinally, Atkins Arboretum was awarded nearly $180,000 in recreational trails program funding to support the bridge deck replacement, the creation of a new trail and the necessary accessibility and maintenance improvements for its \"Over The Creeks and Through the Woods\" project.\nSTATEWIDEPaul Wiedefeld, secretary for MDOT, presented updates and plans for statewide projects.\nAccording to Wiedefeld, major projects include working on the Howard Street Tunnel in Baltimore, major construction on aviation courses and connections, future growth of Southwest Airlines at BWI Airport and bringing the FBI headquarters to Green Belt.\nCommission president Travis Breeding, took the time to thank Wiederfield and the rest of the representatives for their continued work for the county.\n\"Thank you, Secretary Wiederfield, for visiting Caroline County today with your entire leadership team,\" Breeding said. \"Thank you for your continued investment in MDOT infrastructure within Caroline County.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is currently in effect, though it expires after fiscal year 2026.\nThis year's charter amendment would extend the County Council's ability to raise revenue derived from taxes by seven fiscal years, or until and including fiscal year 2033.\nThis July, the Talbot County Council passed a resolution to place the question on the ballot. Martha Sparks, the county's finance director, said at a July county meeting that the 1-cent resolution has allowed the county to add 26 public safety positions, including paramedics, EMTs, school resource officers and 911 operators.\nVoters may mark that they are \"For the Charter Amendment\" or \"Against the Charter Amendment.\" They may also leave the question blank.\nIn 2020, county voters approved a charter amendment, which gave the Talbot County Council the original authorization to increase revenue above the cap by the 1-cent mark. Just over 10,000 voters approved the amendment back in 2020, with about 7,200 voting against it at the time.\nEarly voting in Talbot County began Thursday, Oct. 24 and closes Thursday, Oct. 31, at the Easton Fire Hall each day from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Election Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5, with polls open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The county's burn ban committee requested the council enact the 30-day ban.\n\"Their concern is that we have had abnormally dry conditions with no appreciable precipitation in the weather forecast,\" LeCates wrote.\nLeCates noted that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is \"currently classifying Talbot County as having abnormally dry conditions.\"\n\"Looking at our weather forecast, we do not show any significant precipitation in the near future,\" he wrote. \"The Maryland Department of Natural Resources Forest Service has listed our area as highly susceptible to fire due to these conditions.\"\nLast week, Dorchester and Wicomico counties each enacted burn bans due to drought-like conditions. On Oct. 22, Wicomico County voted to extend its burn ban.\nTalbot County most recently enacted a burn ban on July 21, which was placed due to similar dry conditions and a significant heat wave. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Parties should stay out of school elections\n\n October 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 767\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The official voter guide and sample ballot of the Talbot County Board of Elections for Talbot County voters includes the following introduction on upcoming Board of Education elections:Non-Partisan Contest\nCandidates in this contest may or may not be affiliated with any political party.\nThis election cycle, at least four Maryland political party organizations will be involved in local Board of Education elections at significantly different levels.\nOne is the Maryland Democratic Party. Recently Maryland Matters reported \"The Maryland Democratic Party will spend 'tens of thousands of dollars' targeting at least eighteen school board candidates that they maintain are looking to bring a 'hateful' and 'right-wing agenda' to schools.\" The article noted the Maryland Democratic Party has never before been involved in nonpartisan races for local boards of education.\nThe article also noted the Maryland Democratic Party plan includes hiring workers to canvass, knock on doors and urge voters not to elect 26 school board candidates whom the Maryland Democratic Party says support rewriting history, discriminating against kids and book bans. The Maryland Democratic Party will also provide resources to local Democratic central committees for helping candidates who support \"Democratic and inclusive values.\"\nNowhere currently on the Maryland Democratic Party website is a definition of \"Democratic values,\" nor a mention of supporting candidates who back efforts to improve student achievement scores and ensure safe classroom learning environments.\nMaryland Democratic Party leaders say this unprecedented initiative is needed to fight \"extremist\" agendas favored by certain candidates in 11 Maryland counties — Anne Arundel, Calvert, Carroll, Frederick, Howard, Montgomery, St. Mary's and Talbot. The party also plans to warn against eight other candidates in Allegany, Cecil and Washington counties.\nIn Anne Arundel County, the Maryland Democratic Party has identified three candidates as \"extreme\" candidates who not only support book bans but are also against those in the LGBTQ community. In a post on \"X,\" the Maryland Democratic Party has referred to the three candidates as the \"Anne Arundel Hate Slate.\"\nThe Maryland Democratic Party is not the first or only political organization to target candidates in school board elections. At least three Republican County Central Committees have either done it or are doing it, albeit on a much smaller scale than the Maryland Democratic Party.\nIn this election cycle, the Talbot County Republican Central Committee has paid for a vote early for the school board mailer promoting a school board candidate candidate. The Cecil County Republican Committee endorsed three school Republican board candidates in 2022. The Calvert County Republican Central Committee endorsed Republican school board candidates in at least two election cycles — 2022 and 2024.\nGoing forward, it is impossible to predict if, how or how much, state, and local political party organizations may be involved in local board of education elections and what their campaign messages may be.\nSome may suggest state and local political party organizations have a right to endorse and support local school board candidates.\nThey do have that right. The larger question is if they will exercise that right in the correct way.\nThe correct way is embracing the principle of civil discourse even with those who hold widely differing opinions. In other words — agree to disagree without being disagreeable.\nIncorrect ways include referring to certain school board candidates as the \"Anne Arundel Hate Slate\" and targeting at least 18 school board candidates who are characterized as looking to bring a \"hateful\" and \"right-wing agenda\" to school boards.\nOur society is already dealing with deeply held and seemingly irreconcilable differences on a wide range of public policy issues based largely on vitriolic and divisive messaging from political party organizations. Their continued involvement in local school board elections is almost guaranteed to generate even more divisiveness.\nVoter access to information to make informed voting decisions is not an issue.\nVoters already have numerous opportunities to research and evaluate every school board candidate's background, experience and views on what they consider to be the most critical issues of the day, as well as their positions, or lack of positions, on those issues.\nThese opportunities include but are not limited to information posted on candidate websites, candidate campaign literature, candidate meet and greets and candidate forums where all candidates are invited to speak and answer questions from attendees. Voters can use all these opportunities to draw their own conclusions on which candidates have views on education matters that resonate best with their views.\nVoters do not need any political organizations to make those conclusions for them. Let the voters and the voters alone decide.\nAccordingly, with regard to all future local school board elections, no state and no local political party organizations need to be or should be involved in any way in those elections. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge elects strong, capable commissioners\n\n October 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPHEN RIDEOUT | Section: Columns \n \n 596\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n So, the votes are in from the Oct. 19 Cambridge city election, and all of the races, except for the mayor, are decided.Congratulations to those who won and thank you to all of the candidates for their willingness to run and offer to be representatives for our community.\nWhile the numbers of people who voted continue to trouble me, because there were so few in some races, the only way for an engaged community to go is up.\nThe Dorchester Star reported that 1,543 residents voted out of 8,982 registered voters. That is a little over 17% of the total registered voters that voted.\nI know that the citizens of Cambridge can do better than that. How does the community find ways to do better? Maybe the next City Council should consider allowing people to vote who have second homes here or own a business in the city but live in the county.\nThey have an interest in the city and who runs it and might be offered the opportunity to vote here.\nAs the five wards have approximately the same number of registered voters, the average would be 1,796 eligible voters in each ward. When you look at the results from the different wards and compare the total votes to the eligible voters in each ward for the commissioner races, the numbers are surprising.\nWard 1: 537Ward 2: 208 (4 candidates)Ward 3: 260Ward 4: 266Ward 5: 158 (uncontested)\nDespite the low turnout, Cambridge will have a strong and capable group of commissioners for the upcoming term. People who have served before. People who are and have been actively engaged in the community in their work and their volunteerism. People who want to see the city do more for the youth who live here.\nWith the race for mayor, the total votes cast were 1,498. That vote total was just under 17% of the total registered voters in Cambridge. In watching the vote count on the evening of the 19th, I noticed that there were a few voters that did not vote for any of the mayoral candidates.\nAs with prior mayoral races, neither of the two finalists have a lock on winning the runoff on Dec. 3. If you can vote in this election, whether or not you voted on Oct. 19, you need to learn more about both candidates and make your voice heard by casting your vote.\nAs our local system of government is what is known as a \"weak mayor\" system, having knowledgeable and engaged commissioners is critically important as the city continues the improvements that have been taking place since the city council-city manager form of government was established in 2015. Having a qualified and respected mayor is important for our community and how we are seen by the rest of the state.\nThe other critical piece for continuing improvement here is having a good and solid city manager to run the day-to-day operations. We have that now in Glenn Steckman. The City Council needs to allow him to do his work and lead city staff to address the challenges of local government while they address the policy issues and pass needed legislation. It is clear that Mr. Steckman is the right person for Cambridge at a critical time in our continuing growth.\nEven though the city vote is almost completed, please remember to vote on Nov. 5 for that other election; and in particular please vote in favor of the six proposed county charter amendments that will help our county to be run more effectively and efficiently. These affect you just as much as does your vote in the city elections. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It outlines why he is \"challenging the unlawful rejection of his nomination\" and his claims that the association exceeded its authority and violated its bylaws.\nEaston Club East, a single-family home neighborhood located off of Dutchmans Lane, is home to more than 800 residents, according to its website. Its Board of Directors, made up of three to seven members, sought nomination forms for three expiring positions on Sept. 16, according to the complaint.\nElection voting takes place from Oct. 23 to Nov. 6. Wade is requesting the Circuit Court issue an injunction to prevent Easton Club East from holding its election until the court issues a judgment.\nIn Wade's filing, which also requests a declaratory judgment and temporary restraining order, he stated that residents wanting to be board candidates were \"asked\" to answer a list of questions in 100 words or less for each question.\nAfter submitting the candidate nomination form on Sept. 30 — the deadline day — to Easton Club East Community Manager Rhonda Bennett, Wade says he was asked shorten his answers to be within the 100-word limit and given until the next morning to do so.\nThe complaint states that Wade sent a revised form on Oct. 1. Later that day, the association's nominating committee informed Wade his nomination submission was rejected \"due to noncompliance\" with Easton Club East guidelines.\nFour other candidates submitted nomination forms that were accepted, three of which included responses more than 100 words, the complaint states.\n\"The unequal treatment of the Plaintiff led to the denial of his nomination and preclusion from participating in what should be a democratic process,\" the complaint reads.\nThe association's bylaws prescribe a nominating committee to collect written candidacy submissions \"within the timeframe and in the format established by the Board of Directors.\"\nBennett declined to provide comment when reached by the Star Democrat Wednesday.\nA hearing for the injunction originally scheduled for Wednesday was postponed. As of Wednesday, no replacement date had been set. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He is planning to resign sometime in early December as a result.\n\"Our children are in Alexandria or in North Carolina, and so we wanted to get closer to them,\" he said.\nRideout said although he hasn't made a formal announcement, he has advised multiple people of his plan to resign, including City Manager Glenn Steckman and City Council President Lajan Cephas.\nSteckman said that when Rideout leaves, it will be up to the commissioners how they fill the open seat.\nThe last time the seat was made vacant — when former Cambridge Mayor Andrew Bradshaw resigned in January 2022 after being charged for distributing revenge porn on Reddit — Cephas took on the duties of mayor until Rideout took the helm.\nCephas and Bradshaw are currently vying to be mayor in the next term. The two candidates will go head to head in a runoff election on Dec. 3.\n'PROGRESS IS BEING MADE'Looking back on his time as mayor, Rideout said his goals in office centered around crime and kids, two areas he felt the community most wanted addressed.\nHe talked about the importance of reducing criminal behavior and delinquency and finding ways to effectively divert children into programming.\nRideout said a challenge of the Eastern Shore and Cambridge is that there aren't enough strong nonprofits. He mentioned New Beginnings Youth and Family Services, the Cambridge Empowerment Center and MidShore Meals til Monday as nonprofits that have \"really stepped up\" and made significant progress over the last few years.\nRideout also talked about the Portia Johnson-Ennels Youth Internship Program, a summer program for Cambridge residents between the ages of 16 and 23 that are interested in local government.\n\"That's the kind of thing that I think we need to do,\" Rideout said.\nRideout thinks \"progress is being made,\" in Cambridge but doesn't see that improvement as his or the City Council's accomplishment. He credits past city managers, city staff and staff leadership.\n\"We need to strengthen the existing programs so they can expand,\" he said. \"And we need to find other people that have great ideas who want to bring another resource to the community for the kids.\"\nOne of the things Rideout is most proud of during his time in office are the recent changes in management and ownership at the Bradford House Apartments, which offers multifamily, subsidized housing for low-income individuals who are elderly or have special needs.\nOver the past year and a half, residents have expressed concerns about the safety of the building, from bed bug infestations to call-for-aid systems not working to a lack of security.\nRideout said the city was able to get the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and the local state delegation involved, and city staff put in \"so much work\" to get the issues at Bradford House addressed.\n\"The changes now are happening,\" Rideout said. \"And that to me is how government can work, should work.\"\nRideout said he decided to run for mayor after striking out on trying to find someone else for the job. He said he went to different people in Cambridge who he thought would make a good mayor and none of those people were interested in running to fill Bradshaw's seat.\n\"I felt it was important to have a calming voice during what I anticipated and expected would be a transition until this election,\" Rideout said. \"Because I was only going to do it for the two years.\"\nCephas said Rideout \"brought stability back to Cambridge\" following Bradshaw's resignation. She said he also brought \"steady decision making.\"\n\"He was extremely thoughtful of everyone on both sides,\" Cephas said. \"It's something that I learned from him being the commission president while he was the mayor.\"\nRideout's main piece of advice to the next mayor of Cambridge is to listen.\n\"And listen again,\" he said.\nHe said the mayor should match their ideas to what the community wants and make sure the community knows they've been heard.\nA decade from now, Rideout hopes Cambridge will be a place where students excel in schools, early childhood education programs are teaching kids how to read and write, and new businesses are moving in. He said focusing on the future generations is an important element of making progress in Cambridge.\n\"Because we aren't going to get businesses who come here who have employees who have children until our school system is improving,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Mark Wahl, strategic communications specialist for the U.S. Postal Service, said construction had to be extended due to complications with the removal of asbestos.\nAccording to Trappe Town Council President Brian Schmidt, the closure of the post office caused significant inconvenience to residents of the town.\nSchmidt noted many residents had to travel to Cambridge to pick up their mail since there were many homes in Trappe that could not have mail delivered directly.\n\"All those people, including the town hall, had to drive to Cambridge every day to pick up mail,\" Schmidt said. \"So the fact that we can now get our mail a lot closer is nice. And the services that (the post office) offers, not just for the town, but for the people outside of the town as well.\"\nAccording to Schmidt the construction process was slow and disorganized and lacked good communication with town leadership. Schmidt said the town had a hard time communicating with anybody who knew anything about the post office and its ongoing progress.\nSchmidt said many of Trappe's residents were pushed to be creative when it came to obtaining their mail. Older constituents of the town could not easily drive to the post office in Cambridge.\nSchmidt said he knew of one resident who changed her address to one of her neighbor's. According to Schmidt, the resident was also caring for her husband whose health was failing, and the closure of the post office created another burden for her.\nAnn Frock, a resident of Trappe, said before the closing of the post office she had maintained the same P.O. Box for 28 years. She had to find new arrangements to get mail after the office's closure. Frock said she would drive to Cambridge to retrieve her mail and her friend's mail.\n\"We're really glad that it reopened, and we're sorry that it took so long,\" Frock said. \"And the whole community wishes that we would have been more informed about what was going on. But we're just really glad to have it back open again.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "When can Marylanders expect election results?\n\n November 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Aidan Hughes and Shaela Foster Capital News Service | Section: Local News \n \n 575\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Even before Election Day, the 2024 election generated immense enthusiasm in Maryland, with nearly 1 million people having voted early in-person and over 600,000 more voters casting their ballots by mail as of Tuesday morning.In the past, counting votes in the state has been a slow process. Only about 8% of votes cast in Maryland were reported by midnight on Election Day 2020, and The New York Times has reported that officials expect this year's pace to match 2020 and 2022.\nKatherine Berry, deputy administrator of the State Board of Elections, said in an emailed statement to CNS that \"results will be released after all polling locations statewide do not have lines and are able to begin tabulating election day results.\"\nUpdates will be available on the State Board of Elections website as results are released.\n\"The first sets of results will be the mail-in ballots canvassed so far and the early voting results followed by election day,\" Berry said, adding that results will be refreshed every 10 minutes.\nIn most counties, canvassing mail-in ballots began on Oct. 15.\nThree counties — Cecil, Dorchester, and Somerset — won't begin canvassing mail-in ballots at all until Nov. 7.\nMail-in ballots can also be postmarked or placed in drop boxes until 8 p.m. on Election Day and arrive as late as Nov. 15, meaning some ballots — for example, from some military and overseas voters — won't be canvassed until days after polls close.\nProvisional ballots aren't counted in Maryland until Nov. 13, according to Berry. Over 78,000 provisional ballots were cast in 2016, and more than 112,000 were cast in 2020.\nBecause results from election officials can take a while to release, media outlets are usually the first to declare the winners of elections. These calls are unofficial and have no power to determine who actually won.\nMajor news organizations rely on \"decision desks\" composed of experts that attempt to determine when a race is clear enough to announce a victor.\nThose decision desks rely on a wealth of data, like voter surveys or exit polls, historical trends and incoming vote returns on election night. When a decision desk believes one candidate has an insurmountable lead, the outlet will call the race.\nIn some instances though, decision desks will declare a winner before most — or any — results are reported by election officials.\nThis was the case in Maryland during the last presidential election. As soon as polls closed at 8 p.m., the Associated Press declared Biden won the state in 2020, even though the first votes weren't reported by election officials until 8:55 p.m.\nThe state was similarly called for Hillary Clinton at 8 p.m. in 2016 and for Barack Obama at 8:01 p.m in 2012.\nAccording to an explainer from AP, the outlet doesn't declare the outcome of races considered competitive until enough votes are counted to make clear who won.\nAlthough most decision desks take a cautious approach to calling races and are generally reliable, that doesn't mean they're infallible.\nThe Associated Press and other outlets had to retract incorrect calls for a California House race in 2018, and in 2020 some critics suggested that Fox News irresponsibly called Arizona for Joe Biden before they could have been sufficiently certain of the winner.\nMarylanders shouldn't be surprised if outlets call the state's presidential choice on a similarly quick timeline again this year. If other down-ballot races — such as closely-watched contests for the Senate and House — are more competitive, it's possible that those calls would come later. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The homeowners association's election began Oct. 23, with voting scheduled to close Wednesday.\nFour candidates, three of whom were incumbents, were originally accepted on the ballot to vie for three open spots.\nHowever, a settlement reached Oct. 31 between Wade and Easton Club East will restart the election beginning this Thursday, permitting Wade's candidacy. All votes already cast are \"null and void,\" the association wrote in a notice sent to residents on Oct. 31.\nWade initial's filing, which requested an injunction be granted by the court, centered around the 100-word requirements for answers on the open nomination form that candidates completed. Wade claimed Easton Club East's nominating committee denied his nomination \"due to noncompliance\" despite other accepted nominees also having answers above the 100-word limit to the candidate questions.\n\"The unequal treatment of the Plaintiff led to the denial of his nomination and preclusion from participating in what should be a democratic process,\" the complaint read.\nIn an email to residents, the current Easton Club East Board of Directors stated the reason for the delay of the election was Wade's complaint. The email stated the board \"takes any allegation of a violation of the Bylaws extremely seriously.\"\n\"The Board believes that this resolution is the best path forward for a timely completion of the election process in accordance with the Bylaws and applicable law,\" the email reads. \"The Board also does not wish to engage in costly litigation with any Member of the Community.\"\nIn an interview, Wade said the settlement process was \"quite business-like\" and \"in no way uncordial.\"\nWes Hagood is the only non-incumbent running other than Wade. He says he was the only candidate to initially adhere to the nomination requirements, noting that Easton Club East didn't enforce the 100-word requirement when reviewing nomination forms from the incumbent board members.\n\"I think they've treated Jerry (Wade) very unfairly,\" Hagood said. \"I think they've treated me unfairly.\"\nHagood says in his discussions with neighborhood residents, \"this is not the first time this has occurred.\"\n\"They don't want it to be open and democratic,\" he said.\nEaston Club East Community Manager Rhonda Bennett did not immediately respond to request for comment Tuesday afternoon.\nThe Easton Club East Community Association will hold a meeting Wednesday evening to distribute candidate bios and accept any further nominations for the open board positions. Voting in the election begins Thursday and closes Nov. 13. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Chief Judge Shawn Howeth said it had been busy at the fire department since 7 a.m. He said there were a lot of new voters.\n\"People are passionate about this election, I guess,\" Howeth said.\nGoing into election night, at the national level, Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris faced Republican candidate former President Donald Trump.\nAt the state level, Democratic candidate and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks vied with former Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan for retiring Sen. Ben Cardin's (D-Md.) seat.\nOn the Eastern Shore, incumbent Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md. 1st) faced Democratic candidate Blane Miller III and Libertarian candidate Joshua O'Brien for the Congressional District 1 seat.\nDepending on the county, some Mid-Shore ballots also had board of education races on them.\nAt some polling locations, local Democratic and Republican committees had tables and tents set up, ready to talk to voters.\nTalbot County Republican Central Committee member Shari Wilcoxon said she had been outside the Easton Volunteer Fire Department for hours talking with voters.\n\"I'm feeling extremely positive,\" she said. \"Because I'm getting so many thumbs up. And I'm also getting so many fully-educated voters that know what's on the ballot.\"\nCaroline County Republican Central Committee Chairman Julie Quick said people had been coming over to their tent at the Denton Volunteer Fire Company to take pictures with a cardboard cutout of Trump.\n\"I have (heard) lots about the direction of our country and how important this election is,\" she said. \"That is why we are here.\"\nOutside the Talbot County Community Center, Judy Wixted handed out voter guides with the Talbot County Democratic Central Committee. Wixted said she was feeling good about the Talbot County elections and was feeling \"cautiously optimistic\" about the national elections.\n\"What I know is a truth is, in close elections, ground game wins,\" Wixted said. \"And I really believe that the Harris Walz campaign has the best ground game I have seen since Barack Obama.\"\nTalbot County voter Donna Young said she considers this one of the most important elections she's voted in.\n\"Because women's rights are being taken away from them left and right, and nobody seems to care,\" she said.\nMultiple voters talked about the importance of the single state-wide question on the ballot, which asks voters whether the Declaration of Rights in the Maryland Constitution should be amended to add a new section that guarantees a right to \"reproductive freedom.\"\nTalbot County voter Alecia Weaver said her \"main thing\" is voting against adding this section.\n\"Because I don't believe in abortion,\" she said. \"I don't believe in killing babies.\"\nDorchester County voter Beverly Mundorf said inflation, crime and borders were the most important issues to her going into the election. She said she is excited for Trump. Mundorf also said she is excited for Andy Harris, who she said does a lot for the Eastern Shore, an area that can often get overlooked.\nAaron Woolford, a Dorchester County voter, said he is worried about how the world could change if Trump is elected. He said he thinks it could make life harder for himself and other Black Americans.\nEd Weaver, who is registered as an independent, voted for Trump. He said he sees Trump as \"the better of two evils.\"\n\"Candidates, they really don't talk about the issues,\" he said. \"All you hear is just a smear campaign.\" Weaver said this has made it more challenging when it comes to making voting decisions.\nTalbot County voter Brendan Wazniak — who considers himself an independent — said he voted blue in the presidential, senate and congressional races but said he didn't think there were any \"perfect\" candidates.\n\"I think a lot of the people probably feel that way as well,\" he said. \"So, yeah, it does make it a little bit difficult.\"\nFor updated results in local and state races, visit stardem.com.

    "content": "Talbot County Democrats marked election night with celebration of campaign efforts\n\n November 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 691\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Cheers filled the BAAM Center on election night as dozens of local Democrats watched votes roll in for the 2024 general election and celebrated the end of a highly divisive election campaign.To be in community among like-minded residents, Talbot Democrats hosted an election watch party filled with food, drinks, guests dressed in their best campaign gear and deep discussion about hopes and fears for the future.\nPatrick Firth, chair of the Talbot County Democratic Central Committee, said this celebration was needed for the community on the Shore. Firth said the people gathered on Tuesday are the heartbeat of the Democratic community and more than anything deserved a celebration and to feel appreciated for all their work.\n\"We had a record of over 200 individual volunteers helping us throughout the election, from greeting voters to canvassing, to phone banking,\" Firth said. \"Talbot led the Eastern Shore this past weekend in canvassing, knocking on over 1000 doors in Talbot County.\"\nLined around the room were political signs showing support for Vice President Kamala Harris, Maryland Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks and Talbot County candidate for Board of Education Candace Henry.\nKathy Hostetter, resident of Wye Mills, said she was feeling hopeful Tuesday night though she understood the presidential race would be close. Hostetter shared her enthusiasm for Alsobrooks, who hours later would win a U.S. Senate Seat in Maryland.\n\"Talbot County is one of the most beautiful places,\" Hostetter said. \"We have a great state here in Maryland, we've got a great blue state. So tonight, we're very hopeful, and we want to keep it blue.\"\nHours after the party ended, former president Donald Trump triumphed over Democratic opponent Kamala Harris. Though initially expected to be a close race, Trump flipped several swing states in his favor and won the popular vote for the first time as a candidate.\nElection night was a mix of triumphs and defeats for Democrats in Maryland. Alsobrooks claimed victory over incumbent Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan. Additionally, Maryland voters overwhelmingly supported an amendment to Maryland's constitution for reproductive freedom.\nMichele Dappert, president of the Talbot County Democrat Party, said though Maryland is a famously blue state, this year's election has divided voters, especially in Talbot County.\nAccording to the State Board of Elections' unofficial 2024 General Election Results for Talbot County, over half of voters chose former President Donald Trump as their presidential candidate and an overwhelming number of residents voted for Republican candidate Larry Hogan for U.S. Senate.\nDappert said though there is political separation among those on the Eastern Shore, all voters have essentially the same end goal: to have their values understood, heard and put into practice.\n\"Look, I get it, politics can be contentious, but when you meet people locally at the door, most of us are just trying to get by, and we're just trying to send our kids to school, have clean water, be able to walk outside and feel safe no matter what you look like and who you are,\" Dappert said. \"And those are all very universal values, so I find it very important to defend them.\"\nSitting next to Dappert in a Kamala Harris camo cap and a blue shirt, which showed \"CLXXVII Minutes\" on the front and \"11,780 Votes\" on the back, was her father George Dappert. George Dappert explained the meaning behind his shirt.\nThe front represented, in roman numerals, the 186 minutes Trump watched TV during the Jan. 6 insurrection. The back represented the number of votes Trump was trying to find in Georgia to turn the state in his favor during the 2020 Presidential Election.\nGeorge Dappert said the Democratic Party has done everything they could in terms of getting out to vote, talking to people and getting the message out there for others to vote. For him, practicing the political right of voting is essential to democracy and he urges everyone to continue to be politically active regardless of major elections.\n\"It is what generations of our forefathers and foremothers have fought for, bled for, marched for, done everything that they could,\" George Dappert said. \"To willfully not vote is an abdication of your responsibility and what they have given from their past to our future.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "4 of 6 charter amendments pass in Dorchester County\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STAFF REPORT | Section: Local News \n \n 514\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Voters in Dorchester County this general election were posed with six questions asking residents whether or not certain changes should be made to the county charter.Four of six proposed charter amendments were passed by Dorchester County voters, according to unofficial results from the Maryland Board of Elections.\nAs of Friday afternoon, Dorchester County election workers still had about 1,100 mail-in and provisional ballots left to canvas. This is not enough votes to alter the outcomes of these amendments, but exact vote totals may change in the coming days.\nQUESTION AThe first question on the ballot for Dorchester County residents asked whether the county charter should be amended to say that the review of administrative structure be conducted within the first fiscal year of each Dorchester County Council term.\nCurrently, the charter says a review of administrative structure should take place at least every four years, but it does not state when in that four years it should take place.\nNearly 90% of Dorchester County voters chose to approve the amendment as of totals posted Friday.\nQUESTION BThe second question on the ballot asked whether budget-related due dates should be pushed back 15 days in the county charter.\nThe first due date is for when the county must prepare the budget by. The ballot question asked if that due date should be changed to May 15 from May 1. The question also asked if the county council's budget adoption due date should be changed to June 15 from May 31.\nAbout 76% of ballots counted by Friday voted to approve the change.\nQUESTION CThe third question asked whether the county charter should be amended to remove the residency requirement for the county manager position.\nCurrently, the charter states the county manager does not have to reside in the county at the time they are appointed but must become a resident within six months. It states that the county manager needs to retain residency in the county for the duration of their time in that position.\nAbout 61% of county voters chose to retain the requirements, according to totals posted Friday.\nQUESTION DThe fourth question on the ballot asked whether the charter should be amended to clarify certain responsibilities of the county manager, including day-to-day operations, and establish procedures for certain vacancies.\nCurrently, the charter has procedures in place for council member and treasurer vacancies, as well as certain board and commission vacancies.\nMore than 87% of Dorchester County voters had chosen to approve the amendment as of Friday.\nQUESTION EThe fifth question asked whether the county charter should be amended to remove the residency requirement for the finance director position.\nCurrently, the charter states the finance director must become a resident of the county within six months of appointment and stay a resident.\nJust under 60% of county voters had chosen not to approve the change as of Friday.\nQUESTION FThe final question on the ballot asked whether the charter should be amended to include language to ensure transparency of governmental functions as well as access to open meetings and public records.\nDorchester County voters overwhelmingly supported the amendment, which had received approval from almost 93% of the electorate as of Friday. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

His initiative was broached in Carroll County in 2022.\n\"The proposed veterans treatment court would provide treatment for those veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, accountability and mentoring to former military service members, while helping those veterans to reintegrate into society and connect those veterans who are involved with the justice system with the benefits they have earned,\" Marks said.\nIn noting the success his efforts had in his home county, Marks stated it was helped by \"written letters of support\" from several entities, including veterans groups, the Maryland Bar Association, the American Red Cross and United Way.\n\"There are currently four veterans courts in Maryland — Baltimore city, Anne Arundel, Prince George's and Dorchester,\" Marks said.\nThe court in Dorchester County serves the Lower Eastern Shore region.\nAcross the U.S., there are just over 600 veteran-focused court programs.\nOn the Mid- and Upper Shore, Marks continues to gain support.\nIn August, Marks received letters of support from Maryland Sens. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), Steve Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) and Jason Gallion (R-Cecil, Harford) and Del. Christopher Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico).\nAdams wrote, \"treatment courts provide a second chance to individuals suffering trauma and illness as a result of their service, while providing ongoing peer support to these Marylanders.\"\nHershey agreed suggesting, a Veterans Court could also access local resources where a veteran does not qualify for VA benefits. \"Veterans suffering from mental health issues and substance abuse would be able to enter programs to assist in recovery and be given a pathway to reintegrate into the community,\" Hershey wrote in his letter of support.\nMautz too lent his support for \"a Veteran's Treatment Court in Kent County, Maryland that would support my District 37 constituents in Caroline and Talbot Counties.\"\nIn Kent County, Marks was pleased to hear from Maryland District Court Judge John E. Nunn, who asked the District 3 Criminal Intake Commissioners to do a study of veteran defendants by county.\nThis is a major first step to gauge case volume, Marks said, and he believes once the data is gathered there will be ample volume to establish a regional court. venue. In Marks' Southern Maryland initiative (District 4), he said, Maryland District Court Judge Kristy Holt Chesser asked for a year of data.\n\"I believe we have shown consensus with four of the five counties encompassing District 3 for a Veterans Treatment Court,\" Marks said in an August correspondence to the paper.\nMarks has also established contact with Eric Johnson of VAMSA (Veteran and Military Support Alliance) in Queen Anne's County and although working independently of each other, Marks said they are sharing resources to promote this venue. \"If in fact this venue becomes a reality, it would be my hope that the VAMSA center could be the Docket Coordinator,\" Marks said.\nDuring Marks' work in Southern Maryland in 2022, then Calvert County Interim State's Attorney Robert Harvey said he supports \"expanding legal resources available to veterans through our court system.\"\nHarvey stated he has spoken to judges from both the local circuit and district courts as well as the public defenders' office about the issue and stated the courts have had problems identifying veterans entering the system. Harvey said there is a move to get changes in the application process at the state level. He also plans to observe the workings of the veterans court in Anne Arundel.\n\"We'll see how it's done in another county,\" said Harvey.\nCalvert Commissioner President Earl F. \"Buddy Hance stated he has received a request for support of starting the veterans treatment court in Calvert and has forwarded the initiative to the veterans affairs commission.\nWhen asked this fall about the possibility of a District 3 court on the Shore, Queen Anne's County State's Attorney Lance Richardson said he would be in favor of such a court. \"I see many veterans with mental health and substance abuse issues,\" he said. \"I'm in favor of more options for treatment services. These veterans deserve the assistance as a reward for their service.\"\nEstablishing the court would require local funding or grant funding from the state.\nMarty Madden at Southern Maryland News contributed to this article. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dayspring residents face potential eviction amid safety, health concerns\n\n November 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 724\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY — For months, residents of the Dayspring Townhomes have raised concerns regarding the safety and conditions of an apartment complex just outside of Ridgely. Now, around half of them are potentially facing eviction.On Nov. 13, the Dayspring Townhomes filed 23 complaints against tenants for failure to pay rent. The complex, located just outside town limits on School Street Lane, is owned by the county and managed by a Delaware-based company.\nFailure to pay rent notices were posted to front doors at Daysprings on Friday. A joint trial date for all of the tenants facing eviction is set for this coming Friday afternoon in the Caroline County District Court.\nA number of tenants have raised concerns this year about living conditions at the 46-unit complex, including broken appliances, mold, unresponsive property management and an ineffective work order process.\n\"I've been here 10 years, I ain't never been through this mess,\" resident Andrea Conaway said on Friday, echoing some of those same concerns.\nThose worries only intensified after a non-fatal shooting outside of the complex in August. The incident lead to the county purchasing security cameras, which are now placed at the front of the complex.\nBridge Maryland Inc., a nonprofit organization based in Baltimore County, has held meetings for residents to air their concerns and is assisting the tenants of Dayspring Townhomes with the court process. Bridge Maryland President the Rev. Angelique Mason says residents have experienced the same problems with living conditions for multiple years with no fixes.\n\"We do know that some of them are not being vocal because they might be behind in their rent,\" Mason said in an October interview. \"They had this idea that they might be evicted if they speak up. And that's really why Bridge is being the voice for the people, because some of them do have fear of eviction. … Nobody should have to live (like that).\"\nAmid the worries about living conditions, Caroline County paid $2,530 for an independent inspection of the complex on Oct. 23, completed by First State Inspection Agency.\nCounty Administrator Katheleen Freeman said of the 46 units, one was found to have potential mold or mildew. \"Outside of that, generally speaking, the most significant issues (were the) smoke detectors,\" she said in an interview.\nThe county administrator said East Coast Property Management, the Delaware-based management company that runs the complex, agreed to install the smoke detectors for all units, among other fixes. Attempts by The Star Democrat to reach the company by phone, by email and at their Milford office were unsuccessful.\nOn Tuesday, Freeman noted that property management informed the county it has addressed electrical issues, fixed broken door frames and ordered window replacements. She said she's expecting other items to be \"addressed by the site manager,\" along with an update next week from East Coast.\nThe property, which was built in 1994, has been discussed at numerous Caroline County Commissioners meetings since complaints about the apartments surfaced early this year.\nOn Nov. 12, Commission Vice President Larry Porter expressed his hope that the county sells the property.\n\"Our position at this point that we're going to express is the possibility of selling that property to a qualified nonprofit organization,\" Porter said.\nIn an interview, Porter said the mortgage on the property is deferred because of state involvement, with that deferral conditioned upon the county's ownership and the prerequisite that the property remain a low-income complex.\nThe complex was previously developed by a nonprofit entity. At last week's commission meeting, Porter said a management agreement between East Coast and the nonprofit — which is no longer in operation — was completed in 2000, and that the language in the agreement needs to be updated.\nOn Friday evening, some residents in the Dayspring Townhomes had pulled down the notices off of their doors, beginning to process what the future may hold.\nConaway said it was the first time she's received the notice in nearly a decade of living at the complex. Conaway and her daughter, Tiana Corsey, say the living conditions of the 30-year-old townhomes have significantly declined, particularly under the current property manager.\nWhile talking to tenants who had received the notice last week, Bridge Maryland organizer Hannah Freeman said it's time the tenants stand up for themselves, beginning in court this Friday.\n\"This is why it's important for us to stick together,\" Hannah Freeman said.\nThis story has been updated to clarify the attribution of a quote. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With an overall attendance of more than 4,000 participants, the new location has seen over 500 new memberships, as well as a large number of congregant meals served, she said.\nMore information about community services, including County Ride schedules can be found at qac.org/1291/Community-Services. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Cardin stops in Easton for farewell tour\n\n November 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 569\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Local leaders and officials thanked Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) for his service to the Eastern Shore on Friday morning as the 81-year-old nears his final days of his 18th year in the U.S. Senate.In his farewell tour to the Eastern Shore, the longtime congressman made a stop at the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy to speak with local representatives, including Easton Mayor Megan Cook, Town Council President Frank Gunsallus and Talbot County Council President Chuck Callahan.\nThese officials and state legislators, including Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), thanked Cardin for his professionalism, ability to work across the political aisle and commitments to the Eastern Shore.\nIn September, Cardin and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) announced $10.6 million in federal funding for Chesapeake Bay restoration, $2.8 million of which went to the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy. On Friday, Mautz emphasized Cardin's success in providing money to maintain the shoreline.\n\"At a critical juncture where we are in the world and all the things that are happening, Sen. Cardin is a force in Washington,\" Mautz said.\n\"I'm going to miss you,\" Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said. \"The one thing I respect (about) you most is that you're going out on top. I see a lot of politicians who don't know when to step down.\"\nRevisiting his top initiatives throughout his three terms in the Senate, Cardin noted the work done at Capitol Hill to improve Maryland colleges and universities, expand healthcare on the Shore and upgrade water infrastructure.\n\"There's so much competition for clean water and wastewater facilities that sometimes rural areas don't get their fair share,\" Cardin said. \"We're able to work together to make sure you get your fair share under the revolving funds, but also then use our earmarks for where gaps have taken place.\"\nCardin said local leadership on the Shore is as impressive as it gets across the state, and he thanked local councils for ensuring rural areas achieve a balance of having an economic future and maintaining a sense of uniqueness.\nCardin spoke highly of Easton — a town he says is attracting much attention in the nation's capital. The senator added that officials in Talbot County are adequately serving all people.\n\"You also have challenges, hunger and low-income families,\" Cardin told members of the Talbot County Council. \"And you're taking steps to deal with those issues as well, so we appreciate that. … There is diversity here. And you have helped deal with preserving dignity for all of the people in the county.\"\nPASSING THE TORCHCardin opted not to run for reelection, leaving an open seat in the Senate that will be filled by Democrat Angela Alsobrooks, who defeated Republican opponent and former Gov. Larry Hogan in November's election.\nHaving worked with Alsobrooks, the Prince George's County executive, Cardin said he's confident in Maryland's newest senator.\n\"We've had several conversations,\" Cardin said in an interview. \"I think she understands the responsibilities, so she has the whole package. I think she'll do a great job.\"\nCardin emphasized that former Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), a mentor of his who he served alongside in the Senate from 2007 to 2017, taught him the tradition of Maryland's delegation working together instead of separately. He hopes Van Hollen and Alsobrooks carry that torch beginning in January.\n\"I think that tradition will continue, no doubt about it,\" Cardin said. \"Sen. Alsobrooks will continue to not only be an incredible leader, but also part of a great team.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Federalsburg unveils sign to recognize historic 2023 election, people who made it possible\n\n November 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 744\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FEDERALSBURG — The Rev. Jeffrey Butler, a Federalsburg resident, remembers when Brooklyn Avenue went from being a dirt road to a paved one in the late 1970s. He also remembers the more than 40 years it took for the town to get that road repaved.\"It was so bad,\" he said. \"I mean, just tearing cars up. And we went to the town to complain. They still didn't do nothing.\"\n\"Finally, along with this lawsuit, came them also fixing this road up after 40 years,\" Butler said.\nSince a lawsuit led to the election of the town's first two Black council members last year, the road — which is situated in a historically Black area in town — has been repaved.\nOn Saturday, with the newly paved Brooklyn Avenue in view, Federalsburg Mayor Kim Abner and the Federalsburg Town Council unveiled a new sign that commemorates the town's historic election and the new election system that made it possible.\nThe sign recognizes the individuals and groups who helped make it possible for Black Councilwomen Darlene Pitt Hammond and Brandy James to be elected to the Town Council in September 2023.\nA MARKER OF PROGRESSAfter the unveiling, Hammond looked at the sign, tears forming in her eyes.\n\"It's a lot,\" she said, taking a pause, \"to think that this small little town was able to stand for the rights of all people, not some people.\"\nHammond, who was a plaintiff in the lawsuit against the town, said the progress that has been made in the town is \"heartwarming\" and \"breathtaking.\"\n\"It's a dream come true for me and for others that (came) before me, that we have established that everybody should be represented no matter what the color of your skin is,\" she said.\nAlthough Black residents now make up nearly half of the town's population, the town had never had a minority representative on the council in its 200-year history. In June 2023 — through charter amendments, legislation and federal court rulings — the town's at-large election system was changed to a two-district system to ensure more representation of Federalsburg's Black residents.\nIn April, a $260,000 settlement was reached in the lawsuit filed against the town by the Caroline County branch of the NAACP, the Caucus of African American Leaders and Federalsburg residents regarding its discriminatory election system.\nThe settlement included a sweeping array of measures aimed at providing reconciliation after the town's previous election system was determined to have prevented Black residents from electing their chosen representatives. This includes the town apologizing to those who brought on the lawsuit, affixing a plaque to its town hall building, proclaiming Sept. 26 as Voting Rights Day and erecting the historical marker in the town's Black community.\nHammond said this sign unveiling and the first annual Voting Rights Day celebration, which was held in September, point to \"a new era\" in Federalsburg.\n\"It is a new era where everybody has a voice and everybody will be heard,\" she said.\nAfter years of Butler speaking out about the need for Brooklyn Avenue to be repaved, Hammond said the new council was able to get the project done in about a year.\nBefore the sign was unveiled, Mayor Kim Abner said she and the council are excited about the direction that Federalsburg is going in.\n\"We have great things to come,\" she said. \"We are making great progress in the town, and we are super excited that you're all here to celebrate.\"\nButler said he is hopeful more positive changes are coming with the current council in place.\n\"It's coming,\" he said. \"We know Rome wasn't built in a day, so it's coming.\"\nSherone Lewis, a Federalsburg native and first vice president for the Caroline County branch of the NAACP who was a plaintiff on the lawsuit, called it surreal to be celebrating the changes that have been made.\n\"But I must say, the struggle continues,\" she said. \"We still have a lot of work to do for diversity, equity and inclusion. I know those are buzz words these days. But I do believe that because I want this for my children, my grandchildren.\"\nWillie Woods, president of the Caroline County branch of the NAACP, said the new sign is something that will be seen and read for generations.\n\"I hate to talk about it from this standpoint, but in the future, we will be passed on and there will be other generations,\" she said. \"And this signage will remind them of the stance that was taken and of the progress that Federalsburg has embraced as we are moving forward.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He had a vision for what Cambridge could become, and he had a strategic plan for achieving that vision.\nMost important, Rideout listened. He listened to city residents. He listened to the City Council, and he listened to the city manager.\nHe took what he heard and turned it into action for the betterment of Cambridge.\nIn an interview with Star Democrat reporter Maggie Trovato, Rideout said one of the things he is most proud of are the recent changes in management and ownership at the Bradford House Apartments, which offers multifamily, subsidized housing for low-income individuals who are elderly or have special needs.\nOver the past year and a half, residents have expressed concerns about the safety of the building, from bed bug infestations to call-for-aid systems not working to a lack of security.\nRideout said the city was able to get the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and the local state delegation involved. He added that city staff put in \"so much work\" to get the issues at Bradford House addressed.\n\"The changes now are happening,\" Rideout said. \"And that to me is how government can work, should work.\"\nRideout ran for mayor when then Mayor Andrew Bradshaw resigned in January 2022 after being charged for distributing revenge porn on Reddit.\n\"I felt it was important to have a calming voice during what I anticipated and expected would be a transition until this election,\" Rideout said. \"Because I was only going to do it for the two years.\"\nLajan Cephas, who served as interim mayor until Rideout was elected, said Rideout \"brought stability back to Cambridge\" following Bradshaw's resignation. She said he also brought \"steady decision-making.\"\n\"He was extremely thoughtful of everyone on both sides,\" Cephas said. \"It's something that I learned from him being the commission president while he was the mayor.\"\nLast week, Rideout was lauded with compliments from the City Council, which presented him with a key to the city in thanks for the work he has done.\n\"Thank you for leading the city through a very difficult, tough, challenging time,\" Cephas said. \"You helped stabilize the city. And we got in a position where we were able to get department heads in place (and) fully staff our police department.\"\nCommissioner Brian Roche said that although he didn't always agree with Rideout, he will always respect Rideout for his persistence. Roche talked about Rideout's contributions in getting Cambridge to have a professional city manager as the main decision-maker for day-to-day operations rather than the mayor.\n\"So you left it better than you found it,\" Roche said about Rideout's impact on Cambridge. \"And you did that by fundamentally changing the way that the city and now the county do business for the next generation. So thank you.\"\nThe list of Rideout's accomplishments is extensive.\nHe worked with Dorchester County on proposed changes to the county charter, most of which were approved by voters in the recent election.\nHe challenged the way decisions were made by Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc., calling for a process that was transparent to city residents.\nHe fought for improvements in services for youths and families in Cambridge.\nA decade from now, Rideout hopes Cambridge will be a place where students excel in schools, early childhood education programs are teaching kids how to read and write, and new businesses are moving in. He said focusing on the future generations is an important element of making progress in Cambridge.\n\"Because we aren't going to get businesses who come here who have employees who have children until our school system is improving,\" he said.\nRideout's main piece of advice to the next mayor of Cambridge is to listen.\n\"And listen again,\" he said.\nThat is good advice for anyone in a governing position. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lajan Cephas elected Cambridge's next mayor\n\n December 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 1027\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — After months of campaigning in a close election that stirred up controversies and got voters talking, Cambridge Commission President Lajan Cephas has been elected the city's mayor.Tuesday night, Cephas secured 53% of the vote, or 787 votes, in a run-off election against former Cambridge Mayor Andrew Bradshaw, who received 47% of the vote with 697 votes. There were 1,484 ballots counted in the election. Assistant City Manager Brandon Hesson told the Star Democrat Tuesday that there are 9,183 active, registered voters in Cambridge.\nCephas said she knew it would be a tight race.\n\"But I'm truly excited that the majority of the voters, that they've decided that they're happy with the direction the city is going and they want to see four more years of this,\" she said. \"So it's my commitment to make sure these projects (get done) and to also make sure our neighborhoods are improved at the highest level.\"\nA HEATED ELECTIONFrom past criminal charges to residency requirements to campaigning practices, the race gave voters a lot to talk about.\nBradshaw's bid for mayor came a little over two and a half years after he resigned from the position. He resigned after he was charged with 50 counts of distributing revenge porn on Reddit. He later pleaded guilty to five of those counts.\nIn August, Bradshaw told the Star Democrat he wanted to keep the focus of his 2024 campaign on where Cambridge is currently and where it is going, rather than on his past legal issues. He said he thought voters felt the same way.\nDuring a Cambridge candidate forum conducted by the League of Women Voters in early October, Cephas questioned whether people would feel comfortable associating with a mayor known for an \"embarrassing\" national headline.\nAt the forum, Bradshaw said that in a city where many people have made mistakes, a large portion of the population shouldn't be disqualified from serving the city because of the \"errors of their past.\" He said his convictions were withdrawn and removed by the state and his probation has been abated.\nAccording to court documents, a judge ordered in November 2023 that the judgements of guilt for Bradshaw's five counts of distributing revenge porn be stricken and Bradshaw be granted probation before judgement.\nBradshaw wasn't the only candidate who has received criminal charges. In 2022, Cephas was charged with second-degree assault in connection with a domestic violence incident in her Cambridge home. The charges were dismissed in January 2023.\nAlong with past legal controversies, questions regarding candidate residency were also brought up as the two candidates vied for the open seat.\nAt a City Council meeting Sept. 9, one resident brought up the importance of verifying candidate applications. In response, Assistant City Manager Brandon Hesson said city staff has heard rumors regarding applicants and their residency, but no formal complaints had been filed. He encouraged residents to submit formal complaints so they could be looked into.\nThe issue was also mentioned during a peace order hearing in early October between family members of the mayoral candidates.\nAt the hearing, Lejan Cephas' brother Cambridge Commissioner Sputty Cephas, who was running for reelection at the time, was denied a final peace order against Bradshaw's wife, Natalee Bradshaw. Sputty Cephas said he filed the peace order after he noticed Natalee Bradshaw following him around the city one evening.\nDuring the hearing, Natalee Bradshaw's attorney Philip Cronan brought up statements that have been made questioning whether Sputty and/or Lajan Cephas are following the city's residency requirements for candidates. In an interview, Andrew Bradshaw alleged Lajan Cephas has not been residing at the Cambridge address on her application. Lajan Cephas told the Star Democrat she has met every requirement to be a candidate in the city's election.\nCambridge residents also raised concerns regarding campaigning practices in the mayoral election. Last week at a Cambridge City Council meeting, residents brought up concerns with candidates door knocking in apartment complexes where elderly people and people with disabilities live. In a letter partially read at the meeting, resident GeriLeigh Farrow called out Cephas and her campaign for door knocking at Conifer Village at Cambridge, an apartment complex for seniors.\nCephas responded to the comments made at the meeting, noting that she had invites to two apartment buildings for meet and greets. She said canvassing is not illegal.\n\"And I just really find it a shame that we have other people who are trying to say that (canvassing is) being used to take advantage when we're trying to engage,\" she said during the meeting.\nTHE NEXT FOUR YEARSCephas said she is excited and \"ready to work.\"\n\"What I'm most looking forward to are the residents,\" she said, adding that on the campaign trail, she was made aware of many concerns from residents.\nCephas said she is excited to follow up with those residents and help get their concerns addressed.\nBradshaw said he reached out to Cephas Tuesday night to congratulate her. He said he hopes Cephas will find a way to move the city forward.\n\"If that's not the case, then in four years, the voters will get the opportunity to make different choices,\" he said.\nBradshaw said he is \"not giving any thought\" to whether he will run in four years. He said he wants his supporters to know that although the campaign was a rough one, he tried to run it as clean as he could.\n\"And in spite of the loss, I feel a lot of pride that we tried to avoid going into the gutter,\" he said. \"And that I think that though we didn't get the result that we expected or wanted to see, that we can have pride in trying to have been the best that we could as competitors, and as a candidate and as a movement or a campaign.\"\nCephas said this win means that the networks that have been built in the city can be made \"even stronger.\" She brought up the idea of forming partnerships with the school system in an effort to support the city's youth.\n\"And economic development falls under that,\" she said. \"So the better schools we have, the better opportunities that we'll have, not only for our youth, but also our young adults trying to get into the workforce.\"\nThis report may be updated. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Elmer Davis all voted for the permit's approval. Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery was absent from Monday's meeting.\nIn January, Gunsallus and Montgomery voted against approving the public assembly permit for 2024's event. At the time, Montgomery brought up concerns of \"overtly sexualized performances and behavior\" from dancers at the festival.\nAt the January meeting, festival organizers maintained that the dancers were professionals and not \"scantily clothed.\" The 2024 permit was narrowly approved 3-2, with Curry, Abbatiello and Davis in favor.\nMontgomery told the Star Democrat on Tuesday that if he was present at the most recent council meeting, he would have once again voted against approving the permit.\nEarlier this year, Gunsallus was heavily scrutinized by town residents for questioning whether the town should use funds to hang Pride banners and for stating the Pride flag is \"antithetical to America.\"\nBut on Monday, Gunsallus initiated the motion to approve the festival permit for 2025, which this time was passed with no back-and-forth council discussion.\nTina Jones, co-founder of the Delmarva Pride Center, thanked the council for its unanimous vote during public comment Monday evening.\n\"I know in the past we've had some difficult conversations in this room,\" Jones said. \"I'm glad to see that we have moved beyond those. And we look very much in favor of continuing to work very closely with this town.\n\"Personally for me, it's a great sign for all of our community that this has happened tonight. As Rev. Davis said at the beginning, this is a community that's made better by everybody that's here, and your vote tonight showed that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "What happened? Professor explains Trump's victory to local Dems\n\n December 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 843\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n What went wrong this November? What happened? Democrats, have been asking that question since President-elect Donald Trump won the White House seat against Vice President Kamala Harris.For Kent County Democrats, last month, they looked to Dan Nataf, professor of political science history, political science and philosophy at Anne Arundel Community College, for the answers.\nSince 1995, Nataf has directed the Center for the Study of Local Issues, which conducts surveys of Anne Arundel County residents and students. He's been \"passionate how material interests, institutional frameworks and ideology interact to shape political outcomes.\"\nHis background makes him a good candidate, pun intended, to explain what happened, lending his expertise to the Zoom meeting attended by members of the Democratic Club of Kent County and the Kent County Democratic Central Committee.\nTrump won, Nataf said, but how?\nHe said because despite what their political opponents claim, it was within a small margin of victory...not by a landslide.\nNataf added, seven million people who voted for Biden in 2020, stayed home this time; that made the difference.\nSeven million disappeared, and he explained why, looking into the past.\nIn 1980, Nataf stated, a democratic model of governance shifted to a more economic model. A newfound emphasis was placed on free trade, low taxes and small government, he noted.\nNataf listed off a multitude of reasons for this shift.\nThe dependency for the working class waned because of automation. The fear of being attacked after the Cold War was gone, and so the working class were not as valued in some influential circles as they once were.\nCompanies moved out and found low-cost labor, avoiding unions, Nataf explained.\nA gender divide was created too, Nataf said, because there was a new focus on white collar jobs, not blue collar jobs, and so women could compete with men. This also created a college/blue collar divide as well.\nIn this mode of thinking, Nataf noted, the rich got richer, and America gets split into winners and losers.\nNataf said the thinking was winners went to college and found white collar jobs.\nThis philosophy affected everyone.\nOn the Republican side they became neoconservatives; Democrats became neoliberals, Nataf said. And this philosophy drove the parties for years, the professor added.\nHe illustrated that through those years, neoliberals like former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama unified their party. The Democrats did not break from that leadership.\nBut within the Republican camp, there arose a mistrust for neoconservative leadership, Natal said. Under former President George W. Bush, after 9/11, many conservatives were discontent by what they viewed as their leaders' endless wars.\nNataf painted a picture the conditions were ripe for a charismatic leader to move in. With many Democrats attached to the universities, and blue collar Republicans disillusioned, angry, many years later — 2014, enter Trump.\nAccording to Nataf, Trump won using a zero-sum model.\nHe preached America first and that the country should not be the world's savior. That was different from the Republican leadership, Natal said.\nTrump talked about immigration in the negative which goes along with his list of the undeserving, Nataf said. The professor said Trump listed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ukrainians and immigrants especially as undeserving, Nataf said.\nNataf said with this rebellion from traditional leadership, Trump used the zero-sum model to ultimately take over the Republican Party, taking advantage of the lower class.\nThere were many other reasons Nataf gave for Trump's victory as well.\nHe said that President Joe Biden should have exited the race sooner. He called those who voted for Trump ill-informed, and at times, \"couch potatoes,\" in their research.\nHe said that after Covid-19, and the economical instability, it would have been challenging for the incumbent party to win anyway.\nNataf then took some time in his lecture for questions. There were a few. One woman made more of a statement, when she said America was not willing to vote for a \"woman of color.\" She also said that Trump divided men and women as a strategy.\nNataf thought the latter was a good point, claiming that Trump, when faced with Harris, put on the alpha male persona. He said that an angry populace took to Trump's \"macho behavior,\" and Harris' \"joy\" was not relatable.\nNataf repeated, it was a narrow margin of victory.\nHe said most of the country already decided on who they were voting for. The votes were already \"baked in,\" he mentioned, therefore it just took a small amount of voters to stay home to make a big change.\nOverall, though, Nataf's message was that Trump won the blue collar workers, those who were forgotten about by Democrats since the 80's.\nAnd so the question was what can Democrats do to win them going forward?\nWould the Democrats have to move more to the center, Nataf asked his audience.\nOr, he said, perhaps Trump will be so bad the Democrats would not have to move at all. They will naturally come back to the party after seeing who they voted for.\n\"It is going to take some self-reflecting,\" Nataf acknowledged referring to the Democrat party.\nThe Democratic Club of Kent County meets most months in Chestertown, on the third Thursday of the month.

Both approaches have their pluses and minuses.I have enjoyed the great convenience of doorstep delivery provided so faithfully and reliably by Andre Thurman and the other carriers who have come out at all hours of the night and in uncertain weather to serve our household and so many others. I will miss the friendly headlights in the early dark hours coming down our lane. It was comforting to know there were extra sets of eyes keeping an eye on things.\nI will look forward to getting the Star out of our mail box now though it won't arrive as early as Andre's deliveries. But nothing is constant but change.\nA final cautionary note: The nation's postal service went through great upheaval during the first Trump administration for whatever reason. It has taken several years for its reliability to return. I'm hoping Star managers and our elected representatives will keep a close eye on the postal situation in the months ahead to help avoid a repeat. Our federal postal service is an important part of the glue of our national culture and its employees – many of them friends and neighbors – also play an important role in keeping an eye on our neighborhoods during their daily rounds.\nDENNIS FORNEY\nBozman \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Shore residents share mixed views on new Chesapeake Bay Bridge\n\n December 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1059\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE — Informational displays lined the walls of Kent Island High School's cafeteria Wednesday, laying out narrowed-down options for a new Bay Bridge.The self-paced open house welcomed the community to gather information and submit feedback as the Maryland Transportation Authority conducts Tier 2 of the Chesapeake Bay Crossing Study. The study, launched in 2017, seeks to examine the state's options when it comes to the aging bridge.\nMelissa Williams, Maryland Transportation Authority director of the division of planning and program development, said the team that developed the various plans for the new bridge went through in-depth analysis on the traffic data gathered throughout the year. It has developed seven proposed alternatives to the current Bay Bridge, with one alternative being a no-build option.\n\"We are proposing to remove both existing Bay Bridge spans due to the substantial cost of future maintenance and repair the impact to the traveling public associated with those repairs,\" Williams said.\nBridge spans, full tunnels, bridge tunnels and double decker bridge options were evaluated during the study. Bridge spans were recommended as construction would have fewer environmental impacts and a lower cost compared to other options. Additionally, the bridge spans would allow for greater flexibility in maintaining traffic during maintenance and emergency response situations.\nThe proposed alternatives include either a new eight-lane or 10-lane bridge consisting of two spans constructed north or south of the existing bridge.\nThe proposed alternatives consider bus service improvements, part-time shoulder use, interchange consolidation, park and ride facilities, congestion pricing, and pedestrian and bicycle shared use.\nThe Kent Island open house marks the third total, and second in-person, open house held by the Chesapeake Bay Crossing Tier 2 Study. On the Dec. 11, 129 attended the meeting. An in-person open house was also hosted at Broadneck High School in Annapolis Dec. 9, with 192 in attendance. In-person open houses followed a virtual open house on Dec. 4, in which 435 individuals logged on.\nAccording to Williams, the open houses provided a transparent view of the project to the community.\n\"It's great to show lines on paper, \" she said.\nPatty Baker, of Kent Island, remembers the construction of the westbound span of the Bay Bridge. \"It was impressive to watch,\" she said.\nBaker attended several of the study's open houses last year and was interested to see how progress and updates have developed. \"I couldn't have dreamed what would happen,\" she said, noting now the once rural area has become more and more part of a freeway and for so long summer beach traffic has detected weekend activities for locals. With the potential for roadway widening, Baker voiced concerns about areas so close to Route 50 including the Stevensville Cemetery, where her own family plots are. She said she appreciated the open house's layout and staff clarification to questions, particularly as to why the new bridges cannot be placed in different corridors.\n\"They are doing the best they can with what they are working with,\" she said.\nAttending the project's last open house a year ago, Martin Gleason, of Grasonville, was interested in continual aspects of the project and found it to be very informative in regards to the \"when, where, and how.\"\nAn area resident of 47 years, Brian H. of Kent Island, considered the potential new bridge \"long overdue\" and found the study thoroughly researched. He was enthusiastic about how the potential lane widening change would improve traffic flow.\nTom Helfenbein, of Kent Island, found the open house informative and offered suggestions of widening certain merging areas and moving chokepoints down to Route 404. \"All consideration seems to stop at the (Queenstown) Outlets,\" he said.\nDespite opportunities for public comment, Jennifer Laird, of Chester, claimed she didn't feel like the opinion of locals was being considered and did not approve of any aspect of the project, stating, \"It's going to change everything,\" including bringing in more people from the western shore. Laird claimed the infrastructure was unequipped to handle the traffic and strongly preferred the new bridge be placed elsewhere.\nCheryl Gover, of Queenstown, voiced concerns of bottlenecking, traffic congestion impacts, and was worried how the proposed bridge shared use path would affect jumpers. Gover also recommended finding ways to create alternative routes off the bridge for locals.\nWorking in Glen Burnie, Jay Diepenbrock, of Centreville, takes a round trip over the Bay Bridge at least twice a week and knows personally how bad traffic can be. Noting it gets worse before it gets better, Diepenbrock was a little disappointed by the the projected timeline, with scheduled construction completion no sooner than about 2035.\n\"It will probably happen when I'm too old to be driving,\" he said. Nonetheless, Diepenbrock was optimistic it would be a much needed improvement for future generations.\nHeather Lowe, project manager for the Bay Crossing Tier 2 Study, said a multi-use path for bicycles and pedestrians would be separated from travel lanes by a physical barrier across the more than four-mile bridge.\nDecember open houses serve as formal scoping meetings to hear comments on the issues that will be evaluated in an environmental impact statement, according to Andrew Bing, virtual open house facilitator. Included in the areas of environmental considerations are impacts to natural resources, impacts to parks and recreation areas and impacts on historic properties and archaeological sites.\nThe Environmental Impact Study will focus on socioeconomic resources and land use, and minority and low income population. After time to consider and evaluate public feedback, a draft impact study is anticipated to be published in November 2025, followed by additional public hearings.\nA final environmental impact study and record of decisions are anticipated for fall 2026, along with identified selected alternatives.\nThe Transportation Authority is anticipating finishing the current phase of the Chesapeake Bay Crossing Study in 2026. Five years of design and permitting would follow with construction anticipated for 2032, Bing said.\nAnyone unable to attend the open houses still has time to submit comments through the Chesapeake Bay Crossing Study website. Comments received by Jan. 13 will be part of the study's summarization, Williams said, and comments will continue to be received after this date. \"We want to hear what you have to say,\" she said.\nFollowing the data collection, the study is expected to return with additional open houses next year.\nViewing of the virtual open house is available online. More information, as well as feedback submissions and public comments with personal information redacted are available for viewing at baycrossingstudy.com.\nReporter Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado contributed to this story. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — Significant increases in fines for various violations of town codes were approved by the St. Michaels commissions on Wednesday evening.The increases were made on six different town codes and included including raises in fines for short-term rental, transient vendors and leash animal control violations. The fines for some infractions increased by more than 10 times.\nViolation fines for short-term rentals operating without permission from the town doubled from $250 to $500.\nCondemnation, otherwise known as \"housing standards,\" increased from a steady $100 to $250 for a first violation, $300 for a second violation and $500 for a third violation.\nAddressing non-compliance currently has a violation fine of $25. It has been increased to $150. This means that any owner of a building or premises that is not posted with the official street number within 30 days after said owner receives notice of the official street number shall be punishable by a fine of $150. Each day that the owner fails to display the official street number will constitute a separate offense.\nFines for violations relating to transient vendors, or vendors who sell produce or seafood at a roadside or a temporary location, were increased from $25 to $250.\nPublic urination fines were increased from $25 to $250, and public defecation fines went from $50 to $500.\nFinally, leash animal control violation fines doubled from $50 to $100.\nCommissioner David Wojciechowski asked if code enforcement officers would issue a warning first prior to issuing fines on the violations. Officer Jeffrey Oswald said on most of the violations there will be warnings prior to the penalties. This would not be the case for public urination and defecation.\nAfter Commissioner Alfred Mercier opened a quiet public hearing on the increases, the commission unanimously approved the fine raises. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico), Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) all chimed in.\nHutchinson said he sees improving youth services as a very important priority, referencing a local teen who had been detained by the Department of Juvenile Services for stealing a car.\n\"This is a really serious issue,\" Hutchinson said. \"If we have children who are saying, 'I'm bored and it's fine,' then we really need to work on that and correct that.\"\nSample-Hughes said that some of the bills on rentals and housing that didn't get passed during last year's session could come back to the General Assembly this year. She said it would be useful for the city to keep in touch as the legislators hear these bills brought back.\n\"I think your on the ground insight is very beneficial to what we have to do when it comes to the policy work and not only just the financial side of things,\" she said.\nAdams told the council this year will be a \"budget year.\" The state faces a predicted $2.7 billion budget deficit in fiscal year 2026.\n\"We know that this is going to be a tough year,\" Adams said. \"So legislative requests that revolve around funding capital projects are going to be tough. There is always bond money, and we as a delegation will surely do our part ... in submitting those requests.\"\nMautz asked that the council stay in touch with the Lower Shore delegation throughout the upcoming legislative session. He said that when the governor's budget comes out, the city should make sure there aren't cuts that will negatively affect the city.\n\"If there's an actual cut that's going to affect something in the City of Cambridge, somebody needs to call (us),\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Developers host 3rd community meeting for Easton Crossing project\n\n December 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 591\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Developers and residents gathered Wednesday evening for a third community meeting concerning a planned mixed-use development on Brookletts Avenue.Chesapeake Community Development, a subsidiary of The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, hosted the meeting to update neighbors on its draft site plans and facilitate community feedback.\nThe Easton Crossing infill project is expected to add around 120 units where a former Perdue AgriBusiness operation used to sit. Additionally, there are significant plans for commercial use and open areas.\nRenderings show six buildings planned for the 6.5-acre site. Ross Benincasa, senior vice president of community development at Chesapeake Community Development, said the first building, which will have 15 residential units, is projected to open in December 2027.\nBenincasa emphasized the mixed-income aspect of the project on Wednesday. Some units will be at market rate, and others down to where people \"will be paying $500 to $600 a month for a new apartment.\"\n\"Unlike most developers, we don't build affordable units and market-rate units,\" Benincasa said. \"We build the same unit across the site, and we just have specific ratio goals that we hit for that site. If I'm living in an affordable unit and Joe is in a market-rate unit, and I go over to … Joe's apartment one night, I will have no idea who pays what.\"\nBased on previous feedback, developers and architects are looking into using bricks that are darker in color to match surrounding buildings. They also touched on other topics that were raised at previous community meetings this year, such as lighting, open space and plantings.\n\"You're going to be seeing a mix of pedestrian (lights) and some larger lights in the areas of the parking lot,\" Benincasa said. \"But those larger lights, from a sizing perspective, are going to feel more like downtown Easton.\"\nThere will be a focus on maintaining open space at the property, as well as around 70% native plantings. Benincasa added that once finished, there will be \"around four to 10 shrubs or trees per 50 feet.\"\nAll parking spots will be screened, some by shrubs and trees and others by buildings. While Benincasa said South Street will be a \"secondary\" exit and entrance for residents, developers \"fully anticipate\" most drivers to use Brookletts Avenue.\n\"But we don't want them on Brookletts. That's the point,\" resident Harriett Page said.\nBenincasa said a traffic study was completed by Lenart Traffic Consulting last week, which did not signify worries about the traffic increase around the site. An increase of around 20 cars during peak hour on Brookletts Avenue is projected.\nResident Joe Minarick said \"with Brookletts being the main thoroughclear and the main import\" for the site, those projections \"(seemed) a little funny.\"\n\"Brookletts might be the front of the project, but it is not the only way that people are going to go in and out,\" Benincasa said. Those heading east toward Caroline County may use Kemp Lane to access Dover Road, he said.\nAs for the commercial aspect of the site, Benincasa said developers aren't expecting national businesses. In fact, Chesapeake Community Development is looking for local businesses \"emotionally invested in their success.\"\nDevelopers may also encourage businesses to hire people with disabilities, a segment of the population that The Arc strives to serve.\n\"We have had discussions about if a business wants to hire people with disabilities, then there would be, sort of, credits for that,\" said Jonathon Rondeau, president and CEO of The Arc. \"Or for hiring local as well.\"\n\"That will be coming in 2026, 2027,\" he continued, \"as we think about what those incentives are as we begin to market the commercial spaces.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The new facility will be located at 172 Sassafras Street — the site of the former Millington Elementary School.He along with Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) Secretary Jake Day, Chair of Home Partnership Inc. Phil Wohlfort and Kent County Commissioners Ron Fithian, John Price and Albert Nickerson, tossed out the first shovelfuls of dirt.\n\"As we break ground today, it's not just the beginning of a building project, I think this is going to be important for a lot of people in Millington,\" Hemstock said.\nEarlier, inside the building of the school, in a spacious room with walls that still had paintings of emblematic characters from childhood, Clifford the Big Red Dog, The Wizard of Oz, Winnie the Pooh and Bambi, Hemstock pointed out the irony that the senior center will be built there.\n\"This is a magical moment,\" Hemstock said, adding that 100 years ago the location was a farm. Then in 1974 the school was built. He said it is interesting to think the first students at the school may benefit in the near-future from what is being built.\n2005 was the first mention of a senior housing center in the Town.\nSince then, the concept has grown significantly, he stated, plans altering from building a senior center across the street to this location.\nJamie Williams, director of Kent County Economic and Tourism Development traced the history of the property after the school closed in 2017.\nThe property officially transitioned to the County in May of 2019, she said, then the approximate 24 acres and 36,000 sq ft. building and property were purchased by the Town of Millington in 2022 for $1.\nWilliams, who told the audience the project speaks to the power of community, collaboration and vision, highlighted the partnerships involved.\nThe Upper Shore Regional Council provided $50,000 for a preliminary architectural feasibility report.\nThe Rural Maryland council approved $100,000 for design and engineering cost of the roof and fire suppression system.\nThe Town of Millington invested $1.4 million for repairs, maintenance, utility cost, staff time, permit fees and submitted a $500,000 community legacy grant application to the DHCD for the construction of the roof and fire suppression system.\nHome Partnership Inc. committed over $630,000 towards reconstructing 2200 square ft. for senior-focused spaces.\nWith all that effort, Williams acknowledged, challenges still remain, estimating the overall cost is projected to be $1.5 million.\nShe recognized that also includes creating walking trails, a community garden, and creating other enriching open spaces. That takes partnerships, to \"build a brighter future for Kent County,\" she expressed.\nAfter introductions, Secretary Day spoke, expressing the need for this center in an aging population.\n\"Housing is critical, particularly when we have failed to build housing from 2018 until now,\" Day said.\nHousing costs are high and not likely to decline, he added.\nWith supply chain interest and expensive labor costs, as all the developers, builders and government officials could attest to, it can be challenging, Day noted.\nDay emphasized that with local government all-in, and the developers and community all-in, he knows that Governor Wes Moore would want the DHCD to be all-in, as well.\n\"We're not at the finish line yet but we are 100% committed,\" Day reiterated. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County meeting sheds light on possible police accountability 'overreach'\n\n December 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 756\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Law enforcement officials from multiple counties gathered at the Caroline County Commissioners meeting Tuesday, bringing concerns about an incident involving a Caroline County sheriff's deputy and its implications for police accountability committee practices throughout the state.The officials represented the state's Police Accountability Board, a state agency that oversees administrative charging committees, county organizations intended to provide oversight for police practices.\nThe charging committees were formed as a result of the Maryland Police Accountability Act of 2021. According to maryland.gov, the committees' job is to \"... (review) the findings of each law enforcement agency's investigation of police misconduct complaints forwarded by the agency to the Committee. From information related to the investigation, the Committee makes determinations and recommendations.\"\n\"We have a lot of law enforcement representation in the room,\" Commission President Travis Breeding stated at the beginning of the discussion. \"I think this will be a great opportunity to discuss the role of the ACC (Administrative Charging Committee) and the PAB (Police Accountability Board).\"\nThe discussion stemmed from an incident that called into question the county committee's investigation practices.\nA Caroline County sheriff's deputy, who was not named, was investigated by the committee about a harassment complaint. Charge committee members invited the deputy to meet with the committee regarding the complaint, a move considered by some sheriff's departments to be \"not proper protocol\" or an \"overreach.\"\n\"I understand that,\" said John Bartlett, a member of the Caroline County Administrative Charging Committee who was involved in the event in question. \"I've been called in for incidents happening when I was on the job. That's why I walked to his cruiser, identified myself, asked him if he had talked to a lawyer or if he wanted a lawyer, and he was comfortable with coming in (to meet with the committee) without a lawyer.\"\nA date for the incident was not specified. Charging committee members told The Star Democrat they could not further elaborate on the matter.\nSheriff Donald Barker of the Caroline County Sheriff's Office was very confused as to why his officer was called into the meeting, saying Tuesday that to his knowledge the harassment charge had already been exonerated at the time of the incident.\n\"But the problem I have is my deputy also told me that John told him that he was not,\" Baker said. \"They'd already exonerated him of harassment. So he's already exonerated the entire complaint. What are you going to ask?\"\nPolice Accountability Board members in attendance voiced that it was unusual for a county charging committee member to approach an officer in this manner.\n\"I think that the only concern that I've had is it's the first time I've seen an ACC ask an individual to come in and testify,\" James DeWess, Sheriff of Carrol County, said. \"I think if somebody's got to meet a deputy out in the parking lot and ask them if they need an attorney, then they shouldn't be inviting them in. I think that's an extension of an overreach of what they should be doing, and that's really the only thing that concerns me.\"\nThe Police Accountability Board and the charging committee members agreed Tuesday that the state legislation establishing the oversight committees needs some work in order to clarify protocols for incidents like this going forward.\nCaroline County Attorney Stewart Barroll drafted an agreement that will be sent out to the Police Accountability Board and the charge committee at a later date.\nReading from the draft, Barroll said. \"Subpoenas may be issued by the ACC or by the chairman acting on behalf of the ACC. The ACC may not request or compel a police officer to appear before the ACC unless it has first requested the information it seeks from the LEA (law enforcement agency), and if still not satisfied, served written questions upon the officer, together with a notice signed by the chair or presiding officer stating that the ACC is in need of the officer's answers to make its determination of whether an officer is to be administratively charged, a copy of the notice and the questions shall be delivered by the chair or the presiding officer or ACC staff to the head of a law enforcement agency that employs the police officer, who shall deliver same to the officer and notify the ACC of the date of service within 15 days after service, the officer shall provide to the ACC and written the answers and a signed statement that the answers are true to the best of the officers, knowledge, information and belief.\"\nThe Caroline County Sheriff's Office could not be reached for comment. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Drive-through Chester Dunkin’ concept plan moves forward\n\n December 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 612\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTER — A new, online order focused, cashless Kent Island Dunkin' Donuts franchise took the next tentative steps forward with Queen Anne's County Planning Commission's approval of a concept plan Dec. 12.Maritime Coffee LLC is proposing to administratively combine three deeded parcels to construct a 1,415 square foot Dunkin' Donuts fast food restaurant at 100 Olde Point Village, Chester, in the Town Center zoning district, according to Steve Johnson, senior planner.\nLocated on Kent Island at the corner of Route 50 and Cox Neck Road, the business will serve drive-through and walk-up patrons with no dine-in service or seating.\nWith the lack of indoor seating, the applicant also requested a reduction in 16 parking spaces from its required 33.\nNoting the fast paced style of the establishment and no inside seating available, \"If there's 36 cars on site, there's something wrong,\" Todd LaLumiere, Maritime Coffee LLC owner said.\nConservative estimates on the low end found drive-through capacities at approximately 120 vehicles an hour and, with roughly 11 parking spaces, online order capacity can handle an additional 132 patrons an hour, he said.\nAltogether, the location could handle a combined total of approximately 252 potential patrons per hour, Davis said.\nMark Keeley, project manager at Traffic Concepts Inc. performed the traffic and queuing studies and noted queuing space was \"more than adequate,\" to handle the volume.\nWith dual order boards, the proposed Chester drive-through has room for 30 queuing vehicles, which was more than other locations, he said.\nStudying five Dunkin' locations in Anne Arundel County in 2019 during peak business times of 7 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m, the highest queue from the order board was 13 vehicles, with an average being nine vehicles, Keeley said.\n\"We do 70% of our business by 11 in the morning,\" LaLumiere said. .\nAnticipating \"cannibalizing sales\" to some extent from the existing location, LaLumiere said the proposed eastbound store will serve primarily as a backup for the existing westbound location.\nMuch of Dunkin's business, particularly after Covid has been through the drive-through, he noted.\nThe proposed location anticipates utilizing Dunkin's new drive-through model of separate payment and pick up windows for added efficiency during busy periods, according to LaLumiere.\nSix employees are proposed to staff the location during peak hours with drive-through and online orders, and with no cash register inside, he said.\nLaLumiere also did not foresee a lot of walkup foot traffic for the proposed location.\nDuring the public comment portion of the Planning Commission meeting, Kent Island resident of 45 years, William Howe spoke out against the proposed Dunkin', stating his daughter owned the Fields of Heather Bakery in Chester's Rainbow Plaza — a business that already provides breakfast items and baked goods to the community.\nHowe claimed visitors coming over from the western shore for the weekends would be the only ones benefiting from the new Dunkin'.\nTraffic on Cox Neck and Postal Road are \"horrendous,\" particularly on Sunday mornings, Howe said, and that the turning lane off Route 50 wasn't long enough to handle the influx, predicting traffic backups.\nThe Concept Plan approval was granted by the Commission, who cited the plans were consistent with the 2022 Comprehensive Plan.\nDue to its model without dine-in seating, the location was found to generate less parking needs than county parking standards require and the requested reduction in parking was also granted.\nThe project includes a redevelopment of two existing office spaces and the property will be served by a private well and public sewer — 2.2 acres along Cox Neck Road will be dedicated to Queen Anne's County.\nThe Department of Public Works is in conceptual agreement with the proposals for stormwater treatment and the applicant will continue to work with them through the next phase of the project. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Streaming the meetings on YouTube would allow residents to watch them after the meeting has happened.\n\"I kind of put out an idea about having a YouTube channel that we could upload these meetings to,\" the resident stated, \"so that the public isn't confined to coming out in person or watching a live Zoom, something that they could go back and watch after the fact as they're available to was pretty well received. They like the idea that they could go back and view after the fact, so that's just something to consider for the council.\"\nSuggested citizen patrolAnother suggestion offered by the same town resident was a citizen security patrol to work with local law enforcement on keeping the community safe.\nThis suggestion came in response to the town's lack of law enforcement. Earlier this year, the town weighed whether to close its police department, which was down to only one officer.\n\"Another thing that I put out that was also pretty well received with a few concerns, was a community citizen security patrol,\" the resident said. \"Putting together some volunteers that could work with the local law enforcement, with some training and background checks to be qualified to be a volunteer, to ride around, identified with maybe a magnet saying that there are community watch, maybe some signs throughout the town saying there's community watch in the area, just to kind of reduce since we're having a police staffing issue too.\"\nNew historical society presidentThe president of the Greensboro Historical Society, Vanice Myers, is stepping down as president and moving on to another position in Caroline County as Vice President of the Caroline County Branch of the NAACP.\n\"Effective Dec. 31, I will no longer be the president of Greensboro Historical Society. The new president of the historical society will be Chad Dean,\" Meyers said.\nWhen Meyers took the position in 2023, she was the youngest and the first Black president of the historical society. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Remarkable events, development top 2024 Mid-Shore headlines\n\n January 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Holiday \n \n 1941\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n 2024 brought countless stories, ranging from changes in local politics to historic celebrations.As we reflect on 2024, the Star Democrat would like to thank all our readers for their stories, their support and for being actively involved in the community.\nGROUND BROKEN FOR NEW HOSPITALOfficials and stakeholders joined together at the Talbot County Community Center in October to celebrate the groundbreaking of a long-awaited regional medical center.\nThe University of Maryland Shore Regional Health's project is estimated to cost around $550 million.\nShore Regional Health first applied for a certificate of need to relocate its Easton hospital on Sept. 7, 2012. Industry changes, fiscal concerns and shifting project plans delayed the timeline.\nIn January, the Maryland Health Care Commission finally approved the certificate of need application.\nThe hospital will be built on around 230 acres just north of the Easton Airport and across from the Talbot County Community Center. It is replacing the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center in downtown Easton.\nSite preparation construction is currently underway, with the bulk of construction beginning in the spring of 2025. The medical center is expected to be completed in the summer of 2028.\nThe new hospital will serve as the primary inpatient hospital for Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties.\nSTAR DEMOCRAT TURNS 225The Star Democrat celebrated its 225th anniversary in August. In celebration of the landmark anniversary of continuous news coverage of Maryland, the newspaper held a party at the Avalon Theatre in Easton on Oct. 3 to celebrate the milestone.\nThe Star Democrat traces its history to the Republican Star, founded in August 1799 by Smith as the Jeffersonian rival to The Maryland Herald, Easton's Federalist newspaper. John Adams was president at the time. The paper has been published during every president's term since, making it one of the oldest newspapers in the country.\nIn 1799, The Star stood for the principles of individual liberty, local autonomy and limited central government. As it continues in its mission to inform the public about important local issues and happenings, these doctrines still apply.\nFor the anniversary, leaders from senators to local officials gathered in October to celebrate the years of work the paper has done for the community and will continue to do.\nLAKESIDE WASTEWATER PLANT COMPLETEDIn June, the Lakeside wastewater treatment plant was completed in Trappe. This controversial project, an essential step in moving forward with the Lakeside at Trappe housing development, faced lawsuits, petitions and an array of public outcry over environmental concerns over several years.\nFirst proposed over 20 years ago, the planned 2,501-unit housing development spans more than 850 acres off of U.S. Route 50. The development is slated to include a mix of single-family homes, townhouses and apartments, and commercial and retail spaces.\nTrappe's existing plant had the capacity to take on wastewater from the development's first 120 homes. That flow will eventually be diverted to the new wastewater treatment plant serving the development, a plan approved by county legislation and a Maryland Department of Environment wastewater discharge permit.\nDuring a June Trappe Town Council meeting, two Lakeside transfer agreements were presented. These agreements were the first steps in eventually passing ownership of the new wastewater treatment plant to the Town of Trappe.\nELECTIONS SHAKE UP LOCAL GOVERNMENTMajor changes were set during the 2024 election cycle. Three new members were elected to the Talbot County Board of Education in November.\nCynthia Marrah Jurrius, Karla Wieland-Cherry and Ann O'Connor won seats for their districts. Wieland-Cherry and O'Connor defeated incumbents to win their spots on the board.\nSt. Michaels and Cambridge councils also had significant turnover. During the Commissioners of St. Michaels election held in May, the town had three of the five commissioner positions up for vote.\nJay Hudson, David Wojciechowski and Alexis Roiter were elected to fill three seats up for grabs during a townwide election. They defeated four other candidates for the office, including two incumbents — David Breimhurst and Joyce Harrod.\nIn Cambridge, a close election stirred controversies as Cambridge Commission President Lajan Cephas was elected the city's mayor.\nFrom past criminal charges to residency requirements to campaigning practices, the race gave voters a lot to talk about. Former Mayor Andrew Bradshaw's bid for the office came up short. Bradshaw resigned from the position after he was charged with 50 counts of distributing revenge porn on Reddit 2½ years ago.\nRIDGELY POLICE DEPARTMENT DISBANDEDThe Town of Ridgely was hit with big news in March, when the town lost the service of the Ridgely Police Department due to a state investigation into the town's police chief, Jeff Eckrich. Ridgely's commissioners suspended Eckrich and the entire department on March 12.\nThe town entered a short-term agreement with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office to provide police coverage in place of the suspended officers. When the Ridgely officers were officially laid off at the start of the fiscal year on July 1, the town entered into a new agreement with the sheriff's office for fiscal year 2025.\nThe town of Ridgely has since sold seven vehicles and three firearms once belonging to the Ridgely Police Department, according to records obtained by the Star Democrat. In August, the state announced that the investigation into Eckrich had been closed, citing that \"sufficient evidence\" of allegations made against him was not found.\nC-SD TRACK WINS TITLECambridge-South Dorchester High's track and field teams held big wins in 2024.\nThe girls track team picked up a fifth title when Kassidy Young won the shot put with a heave of 33-1, and also got big points from Al'Janae Jackson, who was runner-up in the 100 meters (13.06) and 200 (27.27) and the pole vault (7-9).\nLed by Jayden Smith, Tori Willis Jr., and Tekai Drummond, Cambridge-SD won the 1A boys title with 155½ points, easily outdistancing second-place Perryville (94½).\nCAMBRIDGE SUES CWDIIn July, Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc., Yacht Maintenance Company and the Cambridge City Council reached agreement in a lawsuit filed by the city in May.\nThe City Council filed a lawsuit against CWDI, the group spearheading the Cambridge Harbor project, and Yacht Maintenance, a boat service company. The lawsuit alleged CWDI was in violation of a transfer agreement it entered into with the city in June 2021.\nThe transfer agreement gave CWDI roughly 22 acres of land — including about 2.6 acres of land subject to a lease agreement between the city and Yacht Maintenance — for $5.\nThe city's lawsuit sought $75,000 in damages and requested temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctions stopping defendants from transferring any portion of the property in violation of the covenants of the 2021 transfer agreement.\nWhen the lawsuit was settled after months of mediation, all parties voiced a desire to move the Cambridge Harbor project forward.\nIn August, Matt Leonard, CWDI's former executive director, left the position, leaving Frank Narr to serve in the role in the interim.\nIn December, CWDI and the Dorchester Chamber of Commerce held a groundbreaking ceremony for the Cambridge Harbor promenade.\nPRIDE BANNERS, FESTIVAL STIR DISCUSSIONIn January, Easton Town Council President Frank Gunsallus and Ward 3 Council Member David Montgomery voted against issuing the permit to hold the annual Pride Festival event. The festival permit was approved in a 3-2 vote, eliciting strong reactions from many town residents in the following months.\nAt a May 20 meeting, Gunsallus said that the Pride flag is \"antithetical to America\" and questioned whether the town should use funds to support such flags and banners, voicing his opposition to Easton funding and displaying celebratory banners for Pride in June. Montgomery supported Gunsallus' statements about the flags and doubled down during following meetings.\nMontgomery said the country is being \"torn apart by identity politics.\" He went on to call out the transgender community's involvement in the LGBTQ+ movement specifically, which was met with boos and some attendees leaving the chamber.\nGunsallus' and Montgomery's comments were met with support and opposition from many town residents and other elected officials.\nIn November, Gunsallus initiated the motion to approve the festival permit for 2025, which this time was passed with no back-and-forth council discussion. Montgomery was not present for the vote, though he told the Star Democrat that if he was present he would have once again voted against approving the permit.\nFEDERALSBUG SETTLES HISTORIC LAWSUITA historic lawsuit against the Town of Federalsburg ended in a $260,000 settlement that includes an apology to the town's Black residents and other requirements memorializing the case.\nThe April 1 settlement includes a sweeping array of measures aimed at providing reconciliation after Federalsburg's previous at-large election system was determined to have prevented Black residents from electing their chosen representatives.\nThe town's Black population has grown steadily over the years, with Black residents now accounting for about 43% of the roughly 2,800-resident population.\nBut until last September, the town had never had Black representatives on the Town Council in its 200-year history. Two Black women were elected to the Town Council during Federalsburg's 2023 election — Darlene Pitt Hammond and Brandy James.\nThe settlement came just over a year after the plaintiffs filed suit in federal court in Baltimore under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Through months of charter amendments, legislation and federal court rulings, the town's previous at-large election system was changed to a two-district system to ensure more representation of Federalsburg's Black residents.\nGROUND BROKEN FOR TRAINING FACILITYIn December, first responders, along with local and state officials, broke ground on a state-of-the-art emergency services training facility in Easton.\nThe A. James Clark Emergency Services Training Campus is being constructed on Mistletoe Drive. The 7,200-square-foot facility is intended to allow for cross-training between emergency responders and reduce long commutes for first responders in training.\nThe campus will have a public safety building and an educational building with classrooms, as well as a 1,500-square-foot concrete pad for car fire and extrication training. Hostage rescues, ladder climbs and traffic safety situations are other ways in which the facilities will be used.\nTOWN MANAGERS Easton, Cambridge and Oxford all lost town managers last year.\nFor Easton, the vacancy is the result of a \"mutual agreement to part ways\" between the town and former Town Manager Donald \"Don\" Richardson in August. Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey has been serving as town manager in the interim.\nThe Town of Easton has secured the services of the professional recruitment agency Sumter Local Government Consulting.\nFor Oxford, former Town Manager Cheryl Lewis retired in June. The town of Oxford was in the midst of controversy due to a previous hire of Michael Calvert, the town's would-be town manager.\nCalvert — who was previously a city administrator for Liberty, South Carolina — had been slated to get sworn in as Oxford's next town manager. But just three days after announcing the hire, the Commissioners of Oxford announced the town and Calvert had \"mutually agreed to part ways.\"\nShortly after the news of Calvert's hire, some community members expressed concerns. Oxford resident Scott Rensberger said it was \"shocking\" the town didn't vet Calvert more because it took him a short time to find out \"there were a lot of problems\" in the town he was leaving.\nIn December, Oxford announced the hire of Holly Wahl, who announced her resignation as Chesapeake Beach's town administrator on Dec. 4 amid some turmoil in the western shore town, largely dealing with increasing water and sewer bills.\nTom Carroll, Cambridge's city manager of two years, submitted his resignation in March. In a letter addressed to the mayor and commissioners, Carroll said his last day as city manager would be no later than May 17.\n\"This was a hard decision for me to reach, but I do know it is the right decision to make,\" he wrote in an email to the Star Democrat. The reason for this decision, he said, was his concerns with Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc.'s Cambridge Harbor project, a project to develop the space along the Cambridge waterfront.\nGlenn Steckman was appointed as Cambridge's city manager in July. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore (D) made a strong push for beer and wine sales in grocery stores in Maryland last month. But he changed his stance before the Maryland General Assembly convened for the start of this year's legislative session.\"This is not going to be one of my administration's priorities,\" Moore said to The Daily Record's Eye on Annapolis summit just a few hours before legislators gathered for the opening day of the 2025 General Assembly.\nTalbot County is the only county in Maryland where beer and wine can currently be purchased at a grocery store. Maryland is one of five states where the sale of beer and wine is not permitted in grocery stores and similar establishments. Other states include Alaska, Delaware, Minnesota and Rhode Island.\nLast month, Moore told news outlets around the state that he would push legislators to pass a bill permitting beer and wine sales in grocery stores during this year's General Assembly.\nEven when Moore pushed, legislators from the Eastern Shore believed a potential bill on the matter would be overshadowed by state money matters.\n\"We have a $2.7 billion deficit this year, and I would think that the governor would have more important things to be worried about than beer and wine sales,\" Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said.\nBoth Adams and Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said this issue has come up every year they have been in office.\n\"I'm on the committee jurisdiction for alcohol,\" Adams said. \"Our committee has heard this bill in years past, and we've not supported it because it would be devastating to small business owners that many of which are in my district and here on the Eastern Shore and have been very vocal about their concerns about this kind of legislation.\"\nWhat has stopped this bill in the past, the legislators said, is the effect competition beer and wine sales in grocery stores will create for small business owners.\n\"Even in Talbot County, where they sell beer and wine and even liquor in grocery stores. If you speak to those vendors that are liquor stores, they will tell you that while they've been able to survive, that those grocery stores are an economic competitor to them,\" Mautz said. \"So the idea that, well, this works in Talbot County, or works throughout the state, I think is a big assumption as far as not putting these stores out of business.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With strong winds blowing through the Mid-Shore, snow has been drifting into the roads, making conditions difficult on drivers and on public works departments.\nWith the next bout of snow expected Friday night, public works departments on the Mid-Shore are trying to address those snow drifts.\nDorchester County Manager Jerry Jones said they have plowed every road in the county.\n\"Every road in the county has been touched multiple times,\" he said. \"But with this prevailing, strong, 20-plus mile-per-hour northwest wind, you can go through and them a half hour later, there's drifts again.\"\nAccording to the National Weather Service, wind gusts Friday night were anticipated to reach as high as 29 miles per hour in Cambridge and 30 miles per hour in Easton.\nTalbot County Manager Clay Stamp said snow drifts are having a significant effect on the county's back roads.\n\"We're working hard with our road crews to address that,\" he said. \"And we've activated our farm community to join our county resources to try to address the re-drifting of these roads. And it's just an uphill battle until the wind decreases.\"\nStamp said the rural community has been very helpful with clearing roads using tractors, which has freed up county resources.\n\"As a rural community, we're very proud of our farm community for stepping up when the community is in need with that heavy equipment,\" he said.\nJones said that in Dorchester County, a lot of contractors have offered assistance in clearing roads.\n\"And we have certainly welcomed their offers and gotten them into the queue to try to help us manage these roadways,\" he said.\nKilmon said Grand Rental Station of Easton has rented out tractors to \"a good few\" people interested in clearing snow. He said he witnessed a few cars get stuck in ditches Thursday in front of his workplace on Centreville Road.\nAs they try to address snow drifts, both Talbot and Dorchester counties are preparing for the predicted snowfall Friday evening. According to the National Weather Service Thursday, about an inch of accumulation is possible in Easton and two inches of accumulation is possible in Cambridge.\nStamp said Talbot County's crews are prepared for the additional snow. He said the county wants to stress to the community that it's better for drivers to stay off the roads if they're able to and allow road crews to clear snow. He said drivers should also avoid the snow drifts if possible.\n\"I think our roads crew (members) are often unsung heroes,\" Stamp said. \"They work well into the night, day in and day out, to try to get these roads open. We appreciate the public's patience.\"\nJones said Dorchester County's road crews are working as much as they can and the county is monitoring potential precipitation on Friday.\n\"We've got a lot of road here,\" Jones said. \"I think it's 570-some miles that we're responsible for. So we're certainly doing the best we can to get that all done. And we're certainly working with State Highway (Administration) in trying to leverage that relationship as well where we can. I think right now, we just need mother nature to ease up on us and give us a break so we can get on top of it and get it cleared up.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

While many of our county residents are home asleep, warm in their beds, these (employees) are out there in the middle of the night during these treacherous conditions and getting the job done.\"\nCounty Council Member Ricky Travers said the Public Works Department employees had to go out and \"spend long hours\" plowing snow.\n\"It takes a lot out of you to deal with it,\" he said.\nCouncil President Lenny Pfeffer thanked Jones for leading the county through the \"first big storm\" since Jones took on the role of county manager in May. Pfeffer also reminded everyone to check in on the elderly and neighbors through this weather.\n\"Make sure everybody's safe during this time when it's hard to get out,\" he said.\nWAGS, WINGS AND WHEELS AND FUN RUNAlso during the meeting, the council approved two pet-centric events involving Baywater Animal Rescue.\nOne event, the second annual Run Fur their Lives 5K Fun Run, will be held on April 19. The event is being put on by Baywater Animal Rescue.\nThe other event, the 2025 Wags, Wings and Wheels Show, has been scheduled for Aug. 9 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Cambridge-Dorchester Regional Airport. The event will be put onby the airport, Baywater Animal Rescue, Chesapeake Classic Car Club and Carol's Kitchen. Proceeds from the event will go to Baywater Animal Rescue and Dorchester County Dog Control.\nAlthough the airport has hosted Wings and Wheels events — where classic cars and airplanes are on display — in the past, this year's event will make pets the \"primary focus,\" Airport Director Steve Nuwer said during the council meeting.\nNuwer said the event will be combined with Young Eagles Day, as well. \"So there'll be a lot of activity,\" he said.\nAfter Nuwer spoke, Baywater Animal Rescue Board President Tom Divilio said the Eastern Shore's leading no-kill animal shelter depends on donations and events like these.\n\"So we really appreciate getting to do this event,\" he said. \"I think it'll be a great event.\"\nAUDIT SERVICESThe County Council approved a recommendation from the county's Finance Department to have Zelenkofske Axelrod LLC provide audit services to the county.\nAlong with the accounting firm having county auditing experience and being closer in location to Dorchester County, Finance Director Karen Tolley said Zelenkofske Axelrod LLC is more aligned with the scope of work needed in the county.\n\"Their audit team has worked in the public sector,\" Tolley said. \"So we thought it was more closely aligned.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Claps and cheers from residents resounded through the Elks Lodge as each elected official was sworn into their four-year term.\nOnce sworn in, the new council unanimously elected Sputty Cephas, the Ward 4 commissioner, as commission president. This decision makes Cambridge's highest elected leadership — mayor and commission president — a pair of siblings.\nAfter thanking his fellow commissioners for their vote of confidence, Sputty Cephas spoke about the importance of continuing to move forward as a city. He said that it will take \"a collective effort\" from all residents, including the youth and elderly, and called on those in the audience to look at their neighbors and say, \"We need you.\"\n\"The only way this works, is if each and every one of you play your part,\" he said.\nThis was not the first rodeo for three of the five commissioners on stage that night. Sputty Cephas, Roche and Stout have all taken the oath of office before.\nRoche, who represents Ward 5, and Cephas were re-elected to their positions in the city's October election. Stout, who represents Ward 3, served as the Ward 3 commissioner from 2008 through 2012.\nToward the end of the meeting, each commissioner spoke. Many of them thanked residents and reflected on their campaigns.\n\"I look forward to working on a lot of issues that I identified during the campaign,\" said Summers, who represents Ward 1. \"And I look forward to working with my fellow commissioners and mayor on these issues.\"\nLewis-Sisco, who represents Ward 2, told residents that, in her new role, she will welcome their ideas, suggestions and expertise.\n\"Our city is not perfect,\" she said. \"But what I do believe firmly is that when we come together and we unite as one, we can actually see our city progress.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester Burial Sites Preservation Board gets another chance\n\n January 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 717\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — A board designed to help preserve grave sites in Dorchester County has one year to prove it is able to accomplish its mission or it will face dissolution.After holding a public hearing about repealing a chapter of the county code regarding burial sites preservation, the Dorchester County Council agreed Jan. 21 to keep the chapter — which includes the Burial Sites Preservation Board established within it — for a test period.\n\"A one-year test from today to see what you can accomplish and see if it is a worthy board to have within this county,\" Council Member Ricky Travers said before making the motion.\nThroughout the public hearing and following discussion, council members brought up concerns of past problems with the board's participation and its ability to work cohesively. Council President Lenny Pfeffer said that in the one-year test period, the board would need to prove it can fill its seats and provide a quorum at its meetings.\nTravers said board members would need to work together, not against each other as has been the case in the past.\n\"As passionate as people might be about grave sites, ... we cannot have this controversy,\" Travers said. \"So whomever comes on that board needs to be willing and ready to work side-by-side.\"\nCounty Planning and Zoning Director Susan Webb said the Maryland Historical Trust is the state's enforcing entity regarding burial sites preservation.\n\"And we were basically duplicating the effort,\" she said. \"While this may be a good board for a nonprofit, being under the county's umbrella, I don't think it's working out.\"\nDorothy Samonisky, the chair of the Burial Sites Preservation Board, said the Maryland Historical Trust only gives guidance and does not \"act as an arm of the law\" like the county can.\n\"So right now, this burial site preservation is the only thing that gives you as county members anything to stand on if there is an incident with a grave site.\"\nPfeffer clarified that the board is an advisory group to the council.\nSamonisky said people have been buried in Dorchester County since 1669, and many of those burial sites are on private property. She said the policy in county code gives the county the authority to \"act upon destruction of those cemeteries.\"\nAshley Samonisky, who also spoke during public comment, said the board can guide council actions and help with outreach and education. She said there needs to be something in the code that addresses what happens if a person \"maliciously destroy(s) a property or (tries) to hide the fact that it was there,\" in order to build a beach house, for example.\n\"There needs to be fines,\" she said. \"There needs to be penalties up to and including the cost of restoring it to the pre-demolition stage. These are just a few ideas that this body can help with.\"\nDorothy Samonisky acknowledged that there were \"internal conflicts\" between several board members at one point. She said she also was out due to two major surgeries in 2024.\n\"We had met up through '23 and had things on the agenda and topics to discuss,\" she said.\nCouncil Vice President Mike Detmer, who ultimately voted in favor of the board having a one-year test period, said he thinks the board has value, but would function better if not affiliated with the county.\n\"It being a law and having to be constituted a certain way and done a certain way is holding an effort to preserve burial sites back,\" he said, later adding, \"I think it could be more flexible and more dynamic as a stand-alone.\"\nDetmer said as long as he is on the council, if someone comes to the council with \"a salient point\" about something in the county, it will get attention. That doesn't require a board, he said.\nBefore the council unanimously agreed to give the board a test period, Travers said the board had previously gone through an \"extremely adversary\" time that got to the point where some board members felt unsafe coming to the meetings. He said the county practically had to act as a referee.\n\"And that's not what we need on our boards,\" he said.\nPfeffer warned the this can't happen again.\n\"The last board that was assembled ... had brought things to this chamber,\" he said. \"Had brought thoughts of slander. Had brought disagreements. I will not allow that to happen during these meetings.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — After months of controversy surrounding its creation, the St. Michaels Tourism Advisory Board held its first meeting at the Boy Scout Cabin in St. Michaels Thursday morning.During this meeting, members of the board, the St. Michaels Business Association and residents of the town came together to discuss the future and current condition of the tourism industry.\nThe board discussed potential budgets, marketing and branding strategies including combining various websites, and getting a better understanding of the tourists who are visiting and the tourists the board would like to bring to St. Michaels.\nTimothy Law, the representative of retail businesses on the board, said as a business owner he is really excited for the work the board will produce.\n\"I love St. Michaels, and today was a huge stride forward to really understanding tourism and promoting our spectacular destination. I think it's a great group of people and we've got a great diversity of thought and diversity of background. It was just a very positive first step.\"\nThe idea of a tourism board was brought forth during a commissioners candidate forum hosted by the St. Michaels Business Association last April, when representatives of the Business Associations stated a need for marketing assistance due to a decrease in revenues within the last year.\nThe purpose of the board, according to a town memo, would be to assist the town in its efforts to encourage businesses to locate or remain in the town and to make recommendations to the commissioners. The board would also \"work closely with the Talbot County Tourism Board on a unified, regional marketing approach.\"\nThe board has seven members serving four-year terms, all appointed by the commissioners. Membership includes residents not associated with a business and representatives from the lodging, eating/drinking, retail or service, marinas, museums and nonprofit sectors.\nThe members of the board were elected by the Commissioners of St. Michaels and include:\nBrian Ball, managing director for the Wildset Hotel, to represent lodging.\nChris Agharabi, chief executive officer of Ava's Hospitality Group, to represent restaurants.\nKatie Blaha, advancement manager of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, to represent nonprofits/museums.\nMichael Morgan, owner and president of St. Michaels Marina LLC, to represent marinas.\nTimothy Law, owner of American Holiday Shop, to represent retail.\nCraig Bertolett, chief operating officer of COLUMBIA Technologies, and Michael McMillan, associate clinical professor of accounting at the University of Maryland, as two representatives for the residents of St. Michaels.\nIncluded in the board is St. Michaels Commissioner Katrina Whittington as acting representative for the commission.\nOn Thursday, the board discussed the importance of a unified marketing message and the potential benefits of public Wi-Fi for data collection. Board members emphasized the need for a clear target audience and suggested a short-term plan to focus on digital marketing.\nBall said it's important for people to understand how tourism effects all aspects of the town's economy.\n\"St. Michaels is very much a tourism-based economy and it really affects everything we do from local government to all the businesses and all the restaurants and hotels,\" Ball said. \"I think that this (board) is a very valuable economic tool to use to help the town grow.\"\nPlans were made for the next meeting to include presentations on budget allocation and marketing strategies. The next meeting will be held on Jan. 30. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Wes Moore last month, assumed the seat from acting Administrative Judge Broughton Earnest. Earnest had been serving since March 2024, when previous Judge Stephen Kehoe was appointed to the Appellate Court of Maryland.\n\"You can put your stamp on the system of justice here,\" Earnest said during Friday's ceremony to Cronan. \"You're the face of justice, at least in the Circuit Court. There are things you can do not only to perpetuate this system, but to enhance it.\"\nIn an interview Friday, Cronan said he's excited to begin as the Circuit Court's administrative judge.\n\"This is a very humbling experience, and it's just an incredible honor to have the opportunity to serve Talbot County in this capacity,\" Cronan said. \"I look forward to it.\"\nCronan received his law degree from the University of Baltimore School of Law. He served as an assistant state's attorney in Caroline County before beginning his own private practice in Easton.\nThe new Circuit Court judge is a founding principal of the Easton-based Hollis, Cronan & Fronk law firm. Over the years, his practice has taken a broad path, including domestic litigation, civil litigation, criminal defense and family law.\nHe said the application and appointment process for the Circuit Court seat was extremely detailed and thorough. Once a judicial nominating commission selected Cronan and two other finalists for the role, they each met with the governor.\nIt was right before Christmas when Cronan received a call from Moore congratulating him for his appointment.\n\"I was super excited,\" Cronan recalled. \"I was in court, I was in District Court in Dorchester County when he called. He's such a charismatic, energetic figure, even on the phone. He just makes you feel good.\"\nCronan says in a one-judge county like Talbot, a judge is \"integral\" in fairly administering justice.\n\"I hope to operate in a way that really makes people feel that they are heard, and that they have an opportunity to be heard,\" Cronan said. \"And that they find the process to be fair, even when it doesn't go their way — that they're not steamrolled by the court, so to speak.\n\"We need to make sure that our citizens find the court a place where they can find justice. If they don't feel heard, if they feel slighted in any way, then we're going to fail. We need to really focus on that.\"\nCronan previously served as a law clerk for former Talbot County Circuit Court Judge William Horne. He noted Horne held high respect for the institution of the court, something Cronan says was \"very powerful.\"\nThe longtime Easton attorney aims to channel what he's learned from judges across the state into his work in the Talbot County Circuit Court.\n\"I've had the benefit of watching so many other judges and how they handle it,\" Cronan said. \"The incredible importance to have a good temperament, to have respect for everybody there, to treat people with dignity.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge City Council hears plans for Harriet Tubman mural area\n\n January 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 677\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — The Cambridge mayor and commissioners spent a significant portion of their three-hour meeting Monday learning about Alpha Genesis Community Development Corporation's plans to revitalize the area surrounding the Harriet Tubman mural behind 424 Race St.Adrian Holmes, president and program director of Alpha Genesis, said the second phase project will help extend the stay of tourists in Cambridge.\n\"Right now, most people who go back there stay no longer than five or ten minutes because there's nowhere to sit, it's hot, it's just not really appealing,\" she said. \"So this is what we want to do to help the people who come to the mural extend their stay. And when they extend their stay, they'll spend more money ... and they'll just have a better experience.\"\nThe plan, which extends into Cannery Way off Race Street, is to add two retail spaces adjacent the mural. One of the spaces will be a souvenir shop, Holmes said. The building itself will also include Alpha Genesis' headquarters, three other retail spaces that face Race Street and an exhibition deck.\nIn front of the mural will be the Harriet Tubman Pavilion, which will shield viewers from inclement weather. Near the pavilion, there will be a community garden.\n\"We affectionately call this project the North Star Village, a tribute in honor of Harriet Tubman,\" Holmes said.\nAlpha Genesis has been working with the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, the Maryland Historical Trust, the Rural Maryland Council, state legislators and the City of Cambridge to make enhancements to the space. Alpha Genesis is still raising funds for the second phase of the project, which will cost around $1.5 million. The project has received funding from the Maryland General Assembly and the city.\n\"And then we have a couple grant opportunities that can cover the rest of it,\" Holmes said.\nAccording to council meeting documents, the proximity of Alpha Genesis' property to city property has made the project a \"joint venture\" between the two. One document from Alpha Genesis states the city will improve Cannery Way and the adjacent parking lot, and Alpha Genesis will focus on 428 through 432 Race St.\nAlpha Genesis is asking the city for the installation of public restrooms, the repositioning of the brick wall on Cannery Way and the addition of a replica of the Ben Ross Cabin on the Cannery Way property.\nHolmes said restrooms would benefit tourists who come from far distances to see the mural. Alpha Genesis' proposal is to construct a \"North Star Station\" that includes two all-gender bathrooms, a 135-square-foot public meeting room and a small lobby space with digital kiosks that have information about the city.\nRESTROOM DISCUSSIONCommissioners asked a variety of questions about Alpha Genesis' plans. Multiple questions focused on the restroom proposal.\nCommissioner Brian Roche shared his concern with the North Star Station blocking the view of the water from Cannery Way. Holmes said a possible change to the proposal could be to remove the meeting room from the station to make it smaller.\nCommission President Sputty Cephas asked who would be responsible for maintaining the public restrooms. Alpha Genesis Executive Director Jermaine Anderson said he thinks it would be a good idea to form a youth or recidivism program where those in the program would be tasked with maintaining areas around the mural.\n\"Now's the time,\" he said. \"Let's get real creative. Let's continue planning, continue talking, developing relationships. ... I think we can find the solutions we need.\"\nDuring public comment, Chuck McFadden said he supports revitalizing the area, but the city should be careful about how much it commits. McFadden also cautioned that bringing youth in to clean the public restrooms might not be an easy feat.\nAfter council discussion, the City Council unanimously voted to have city staff work closely with Alpha Genesis on its proposal and make sure it gets through the Historic Preservation Commission and the Planning and Zoning Commission. The vote, which Cephas motioned, also called for a presentation on the fiscal impact of the proposal and made sure Roche and any other interested commissioners can work with city staff on the matter. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The location was chosen for the Green Thumb's ability to grow as expansion is a key component of the business model and needed to stay competitive, she said.\nGreen Thumb is considered one of the largest private employers in town and in the county, employing over 200 at the Comet Drive location, Brown said.\nByers Scientific performs the testing samples both indoor and outdoor for Green Thumb twice a year previously in June, Brown said.\nWhile odor hasn't completely gone away, Green Thumb was doing everything it could to diminish odors, \"and we're not going to stop doing that,\" according to Brown.\nSmells have been identified as coming from harvesting and processing, not just budding outside, Green Thumb officials said, and mitigation has been applied where odors have been noted to be the most prevalent including the extraction lab, and the indoor kitchen hood, where edible products are created.\nGreen Thumb previously utilized a cost-prohibited hemp dryer, while moving forward, seeks to use fully enclosed drying containers with charcoal odor mitigation built in, according to officials.\nScrubbing the air, the 40-foot long, eight-foot wide containers perform roughly 42 air changes per hour and filters are swapped out every two weeks, officials said.\nThe same odor mitigation technology already employed will be utilized on a broader scale, she said.\nBrown claimed with the expansion, twice that outdoor growing area would not double the odor, \"It's sort of like when you bake two apple pies versus you bake four apple pies, you're not going to smell any additional pies, you're already smelling it.\"\nAcknowledging she was not in the marijuana industry, planning commission member Wendy Emerson disagreed with the pie analogy, stating herself as a baker, and that \"four pies will in fact provide more scent.\"\nEmerson sought information regarding the industry's standards that she claimed should have been shared with the planning commission prior, including what was the odor level previously, where is it today, and what is the intended increase.\nNoting existing technology to detect other odors such as carbon monoxide monitors, Emerson sought exploring technology to monitor cannabis odors and Brown said Green Thumb could look into technology as part of the expansion's approval.\nThe planning commission also noted the plan's public works agreement and tree canopy requirements need addressing.\nTabling a vote, the planning commission determined there was not enough information and sought additional comments to be addressed including testing data from other Green Thumb sites during the fall months and submission of the most recent Jan. 20 test results. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tunis Mills bridge replacement project moves forward\n\n January 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 629\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TUNIS MILLS — A beloved bridge in the Tunis Mills community is moving toward reconstruction after months of resident input into the bridge's redesign.In recent years, the 345-foot-long Leeds Creeks Bridge and its wood planks have deteriorated. County engineers consider the bridge structurally deficient, necessitating a replacement.\nTuesday, the Talbot County Council agreed to move forward with the bridge replacement project. County Engineer Ray Clarke recommended the county work toward finalizing rights-of-way acquisitions and necessary permits so construction can be pursued later this year.\nAs proposed, the replacement would include a wooden deck and a timber wearing surface. The structures below the bridge supporting it, known as piles, would consist of concrete and steel materials.\nClarke told council members that in order to use federal funding for the project, the bridge replacement project cannot use timber piles per the State Highway Administration. He added that trying to build an all-timber replacement will cause significant delays and costs.\n\"The big disadvantage we have is that if we don't get the federal aid, we're probably going to need to request the council for additional funding for the project, local funding,\" Clarke said. \" … This could be a $3 or $4 million ask.\"\nThe project costs around $6.5 million, with $1.5 million coming from the county. The rest is federally funded.\nAdvocates of a 100% wooden replacement have been in dialogue with the county, including at an August public meeting. Susan McDermott and John Tabori, two of those advocates, have lived in Tunis Mills next to the bridge for four years.\nMcDermott says the original proposal to rebuild the bridge many years ago \"was just unacceptable to the community.\" The county's recent proposal matches more of what she and some other neighbors had hoped for.\n\"We're very pleased that the council has shown as much flexibility toward community views as it has,\" McDermott said.\nResidents like McDermott previously expressed concerns that an asphalt wearing surface would encourage speeding across the bridge. The county's plans now include a timber wearing surface. Clarke said that change will amount to around a $250,000 increase.\nThe other main change based on community feedback is a reduction in the height of the safety railing from 42 to 36 inches.\nMcDermott, who leads a small group of neighbors called the Tunis Mills All-Timber Bridge Alliance, hopes to find answers to whether an exception can be made for the requirement that piles not be timber.\nShe adds that the bridge is an integral part of the community.\n\"I think the town feels that the wooden bridge of Tunis Mills — one of the last wooden-deck bridges in the county — is very much part of the community,\" McDermott said. \"It's not just a bridge that occasional traffic goes across. We've got a lot of walkers in this neighborhood, a lot of kids and people just use that bridge as a foot path.\"\nAfter a video of the bridge was shown during the meeting, Talbot County Council Member Lynn Mielke said it seems the replacement \"needs to be done sooner rather than later.\"\nTalbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher thanked Clarke and his team for their efforts to advance the replacement project.\n\"I appreciate the homework that you've done to investigate the alternatives as requested and appreciate that we really can't sacrifice the federal aid,\" Lesher said. \"The economics of this project dictate that we absolutely need to go with the recommended steel concrete pilings and concrete cap.\"\nLesher motioned to approve the project as presented, and the rest of the council unanimously agreed. Lesher added that he hopes the federal funding for the project comes through, referencing President Donald Trump's temporary pause on federal grants and loans announced earlier this week and rescinded Wednesday.\n\"And we'll just hope that any suspension of federal grant aid for transportation projects is very short-lived,\" Lesher said Tuesday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Statewide, Group 1 property values increased 20.1% on average.\nEach year, one of three groups is reassessed, determining its property value change from three years ago. Last year, Group 3 properties were reassessed, with their values increasing by 18.4% from the previous assessment.\nHowever, the 20.1% mark statewide is down from 2024's reassessment average in Maryland, which was 23.4%.\nIn 2022, Group 1 property values rose by a higher rate of 6.2% in Talbot County.\n\"It's just where we are,\" said Jim Bent, an Easton-based realtor for Benson & Mangold Real Estate. \"I think we're going to have some kind of a reset in values at some point in the next few years. I don't think it's going to be what we saw in 2007. But different neighborhoods can only go a certain amount.\"\nHe added that \"it's awful hard once you get the price up to get it back down.\" Home values are sharply increasing due to construction costs, among other factors, Bent said.\n\"For someone to come in and purchase a piece of land that has no development on it and start the process with engineers, attorneys, architects, everything else, they've got a significant amount of money invested before they start digging in the ground,\" Bent said.\nProperty taxes will not necessarily increase at the same rate as the value reassessments do, since each year only one of three groups is reassessed.\nTalbot County Finance Director Martha Sparks added that the assessment's impact on property owners is \"more complicated\" due to Talbot County's revenue cap, which limits how much the county can collect from property tax revenue.\nProperty owners can receive credit through the Homestead Tax Credit program if their property is considered their principal residence. Those who received property assessment notices in the mail this month will see their tax credit status.\nLesley Jackson, Talbot County supervisor at the Maryland Department of Reassessments and Taxation, says those who have \"approved\" written in the box under the \"principal residence\" line on the notice are set to receive their tax credit.\nJackson says property owners with a box that reads \"denied\" should contact the department. Those who received notices reading \"Principal Residence: NO\" have not applied, and if it is their primary residence, they can apply online for the tax credit. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It aims to address the growing need for modern and efficient detention facilities in the region, where counties are struggling to finance renovations or replacements of their aging detention facilities.\nThe commissioners said they still have not received exact numbers for how much everything will cost and how much the county will save by joining the agreement with the other counties.\nCaroline County Commission Vice President Larry Porter suggested that the county should do an independent evaluation of the operating cost.\n\"This decision is going to depend on the operational cost and I'm talking long range operational cost,\" Porter said. \"Would it make sense for us to engage someone to do an independent evaluation of these operating cost?\"\nThe county also want numbers crunched on transportation, employment and other things.\n\"The biggest question we all have is the operating side of the detention center,\" Deputy Administrator Daniel Fox said.\nThe county will have Fox run an independent evaluation to get some calculated numbers to the administrators. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Attorney general releases immigration guidances; local officials react\n\n February 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 502\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the days since President Donald Trump signed executive orders bringing sweeping changes to immigration policy, Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown has released immigration enforcement guidance for local law enforcement agencies and healthcare providers.Last week, Brown joined 10 other attorney generals across the United States in addressing the president's federal immigration directives.\nIn a joint statement, they wrote that state and local law enforcement agencies \"cannot be commandeered\" to assist federal immigration agents.\n\"As state attorneys general, we have a responsibility to enforce state laws — and we will continue to investigate and prosecute crimes, regardless of immigration status,\" the statement read. \"We will not be distracted by the President's mass deportation agenda.\"\nLAW ENFORCEMENT\nIn Brown's guidance toward law enforcement, the attorney general stated, \"the federal government cannot compel state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws.\"\n\"This guidance ensures that law enforcement agencies understand the scope and limitations of their authority and makes clear that the rule of law does not change depending on the federal government's priorities,\" Brown wrote.\nThe guidance outlines that police officers cannot do the following: extend detentions to investigate immigration status, give names and addresses to federal authorities without a warrant, or ask about immigration status if it's not relevant to an investigation.\nDorchester County Sheriff James Phillips said his department won't overstep boundaries, but they will assist federal authorities if requested.\n\"If they ask for police assistance, we're going to help them,\" Phillips said.\n\"It's his opinion, it's how he's interpreting the law, and I understand that,\" said Phillips of Brown's guidance, later adding that \"I'm not going to turn my back on another police officer doing his job.\"\nCaroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker said as he's aware, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is \"going after hardened criminals that are in Caroline County.\"\nBaker said the sheriff's office will assist federal immigration agents in ways that federal and Maryland laws permit. He said that U.S. Homeland Security Investigations has had a presence in recent weeks.\n\"I think that HSI has peaked as far as going after people who are here illegally and are committing crimes,\" Baker said of what he's heard from his deputies.\nHEALTHCARE FACILITIESIn his guidance to healthcare providers, Brown wrote that \"no Marylander, regardless of immigration status, should have to choose between their health and safety.\"\nIf an immigration agent enters a healthcare facility, Brown's guidance instructs staff to request the agent's credentials and contact legal counsel.\nThe attorney general said healthcare staff shouldn't give out patient information unless shown a warrant, subpoena or summons. Brown added that staff shouldn't \"attempt to bar the officer from public spaces\" or \"take other action to thwart the investigation.\"\nTrena Williamson, regional director of communications and marketing for the University of Maryland Shore Regional Health, said the medical system \"has a consistent approach\" for interactions with all law enforcement officers.\n\"We remain committed to complying with federal and state laws while ensuring all Marylanders have access to essential health care services,\" Williamson wrote. \"Recent executive orders from the president have not resulted in any changes to our approach.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Design for new Francis Scott Key Bridge unveiled\n\n February 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LIV BARRY obarry@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 582\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Tuesday morning, Gov. Wes Moore joined local, state and national leaders at Tradepoint Atlantic to unveil the design for the new Francis Scott Key Bridge: a 285-foot cable-stayed bridge, which will stand in the same place as the former structure.The new cable-stayed structure will be the first of its kind in the state, with two lanes of traffic in each direction, 10-foot shoulders and enough height to accommodate passing vessels. According to Moore, the rebuilding will employ \"many Marylanders\" and use the \"best materials\" available.\n\"We get cars from Michigan out to market. We bring sugars and spices to Louisiana. We haul farm equipment from the East Coast deep into the farmland. Commerce and trade are the bedrock of our state,\" Moore said.\nDuring the conference, Moore noted the hard work of Marylanders during recovery efforts following the bridge's collapse last year and the ongoing rebuilding process.\nAccording to the governor, initial reports estimated that it would take 11 months to clear the site of the collapse and reopen the Port of Baltimore. The recovery process took only 11 weeks.\nAlongside Moore, Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-Md.) remarked that the process would not have been possible without bipartisan cooperation.\n\"We are able to get here by being able to work together,\" the governor said. \"Without that level of bipartisan support, we wouldn't be here.\"\nMoore has high hopes that the rebuilding will strengthen the Port of Baltimore, turning the city into \"a maritime hub for the East Coast and a maritime hub for the nation.\"\nOther local leaders not in attendance weighed in on the pivotal point in the bridge's reconstruction.\nRep. Johnny Olszewski (D-Md.), who grew up in Dundalk and represented the area as Baltimore County Executive until last month, believes the bridge's reconstruction is a symbol of the area's resilience.\n\"The Key Bridge was symbolic of our community's grit and fortitude, and its collapse was deeply painful and personal for so many of us. We grieved the men who lost their lives in this unimaginable tragedy and suffered the pain of uncertain livelihoods in the weeks that followed,\" Olszewski said. \"Today, we celebrate an important milestone as we do what Baltimore always does in the toughest of times: rebuild bigger, better, stronger.\"\nDespite the solidified design, there are a number of elements still to be determined — namely the bridge's title.\nSince the bridge's collapse, the Caucus of African American Leaders, a coalition of Black activists across the United States, have called for the renaming of the span due to Francis Scott Key's history as an owner of enslaved people. Alternatively, the organization suggested the bridge be renamed after Rep. Parren J. Mitchell, the first Black Marylander elected to the House of Representatives in 1970.\nDuring the current legislative session, the Maryland Senate is set to hear Senate Bill 119, which \"will honor the history and legacy of Maryland\" by retaining Key's name.\nAdditionally, there are ongoing discussions about a memorial for the six men whose lives were lost during the collapse. Although Moore was asked about a potential memorial during the conference, he did not provide a clear answer.\n\"Once the bridge is complete, the memory of those lost on March 26 will not be forgotten,\" Moore said.\nFollowing the ongoing surveying around the site, the next step in the rebuilding process will be the demolition of the remaining pillars on either side of the former bridge. The demolition is anticipated to occur in May.\nConstruction on the new structure will begin \"immediately after,\" according to Moore, and is slated to be completed by 2028. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton leaders at odds over affordable housing ordinance's next step\n\n February 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 602\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Town leaders held a tense discussion Monday regarding inclusionary zoning, debating how quickly the town should move forward with an ordinance meant to address affordable housing shortages.At Monday's meeting, the Town Council was asked to schedule a workshop to review the draft of an inclusionary zoning ordinance that's been in the works for two years.\nIn November, the Planning Commission approved the ordinance by a 4-1 vote. It would require residential developers to allocate 15% of their units as affordable.\nInitially, Town Council President Frank Gunsallus made a motion for the town to seek out a firm and delay the workshop. The motion was immediately seconded by Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery, but a lengthy discussion followed before the motion was eventually rescinded.\n\"It's clear from studies in other jurisdictions that the impacts have varied but that they have included a serious slow down in building because this is essentially a tax on builders,\" Montgomery said of inclusionary zoning. \"They've included higher housing costs to the extent that it's been possible to pass those on.\"\nGunsallus proposed the town find an independent firm to conduct a study \"over the next nine to 12 months.\" The firm would provide \"an objective analysis\" of the positive and negative effects an inclusionary zoning ordinance may have, he said.\nMontgomery said in his experience, the town could be \"looking at $50,000 at a minimum\" for such a study.\nMayor Megan Cook disagreed with the proposal to hire an outside firm for a long-term study. She emphasized that town planners, staff, and the Planning Commission have already spent a significant amount of time drafting the ordinance and considering its potential effects.\nTown planners worked with an advisory firm, David Paul Rosen & Associates, to help revise the legislation last summer.\n\"What information are you looking to gain that has not already been looked at?\" Cook asked Gunsallus. \"And by the way, we don't have $50,000 in this year's budget.\"\n\"I beg to differ,\" Gunsallus responded. \"I read the budget thoroughly, I would actually very much beg to differ on that.\"\nWard 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry said she'd like to \"see the scope of work\" before the town commits funds toward a study. Curry asked who would select the firm. Gunsallus said the council would be in charge.\n\"Why? Why would the council be choosing?\" Cook asked.\n\"Because we're the ones tasked with needing to make a decision on this,\" Gunsallus said. \"The town has already spent a significant amount of money into drafting it. Because the responsibility ends right here, that's why.\"\nGunsallus later added that based on studies he's read, there are \"serious doubts\" about whether inclusionary zoning will lead to the number of affordable units the town is seeking.\n\"But there's equal research out there that shows that it will,\" Cook said.\nCouncilmembers Don Abbatiello and the Rev. Elmer Davis said they'd like to have the workshop before making a decision on a study. Council agreed to a March 3 workshop for the Attainable Housing Task Force to provide a report related to the ordinance.\nGunsallus maintained that he appreciates the hard work of town staff. He said it's the council's \"responsibility to carefully evaluate what has worked elsewhere before determining the best course of action for Easton.\"\n\"There is a serious housing issue with the Town of Easton,\" Cook said toward the end of the discussion. \"We can't even employ a police officer, hire a new police officer, and have them be able to live in the town that they have been sworn to serve. That is a real issue.\"\n\"We are talking this to death,\" Cook added. \"And that is inaction by constant conversation.\"\nThis story has been updated. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Steve Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) has introduced Senate Bill 562, which would designate the original Maryland Orange Crush as the state cocktail. The bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Wicomico, Worcester).\nHershey also sponsored Senate Bill 561, which, along with House Bill 227 sponsored by Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), would allow electric cooperatives to use unclaimed funds only to assist cooperative members or donate to nonprofit organizations, rather than treating them as abandoned property.\nAdditionally, Hershey introduced Senate Bill 355, seeking to delay the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program by two years.\nEnergy and Education LegislationDel. Jeff Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) is behind two bills on solar energy regulation: House Bill 739 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 478) and House Bill 742. One bill would prohibit the use of eminent domain for solar siting, while the other would return control over solar development to county governments.\nGhrist also introduced House Bill 736, which seeks to remove the mandate requiring local school systems to offer pre-kindergarten for three-year-olds. Another provision in the bill would increase state funding to help Kent County construct a new middle school.\nOn law enforcement, Ghrist is supporting a bill — potentially House Bill 122 — that would require the removal of unfounded complaints from police personnel files.\nNursing, Historic Preservation, and Cemetery ProtectionsDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) has proposed House Bill 602 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 407), directing the State Board of Nursing to negotiate reciprocity agreements with neighboring states for advanced practice nursing licensure. Another measure, House Bill 616 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 421), would extend the statute of limitations for crimes related to cemetery destruction and prohibit damaging cemetery landscaping. The bill is co-sponsored by Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico).\nHutchinson is also behind House Bill 760, which would establish a local appeals process for Maryland Historic Trust decisions.\nBudget Deficit Shifts to CountiesGov. Wes Moore's proposed budget shifts some of the state's structural deficit onto county governments. Ghrist criticized the move, stating that counties did not contribute to the deficit but are now being forced to compensate for state overspending.\n\"For my district, $720,000 will be shifted to Caroline County on top of an additional $1.8 million more that the county will have to add to education under Kirwan mandates,\" Ghrist stated. He cited similar financial burdens for other Eastern Shore counties, including Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne's.\n\"This will stifle economic growth because people will be sending more of their hard-earned money to the government rather than spending it in their local economies,\" Ghrist added.\nLaw Enforcement and Traffic StopsA controversial proposal, Senate Bill 292, has drawn strong opposition from law enforcement officials, including Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker. The bill would reclassify certain primary traffic offenses as secondary offenses, preventing law enforcement from stopping drivers solely for those violations.\n\"These minor traffic violations could actually lead to catching suspects that have committed serious felonies, recovering firearms, and stopping drug-related crimes,\" Baker said. A hearing on the bill is scheduled before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee.\nOther Bills of Local InterestHouse Bill 28, sponsored by Del. Josh Bouchat (R-Carroll, Frederick), proposes a constitutional amendment requiring all Maryland counties to adopt a charter government structure.\nHouse Bill 278, also from Bouchat, would provide an income tax subtraction modification for enhanced agricultural management equipment to support sustainable farming practices.\nHouse Bill 192, introduced by Del. Nino Mangione (R-Baltimore County), aims to curb student cell phone use in schools under the proposed \"No Distracted Learning Act.\"\nAs these bills move through the legislature, local officials and residents will have the opportunity to voice their support or concerns during committee hearings and public forums. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Emergency responders were great as well.\"\nSchools decided to keep campuses closed Wednesday because of the snowfall, but several districts had students attend class virtually.\nTalbot County Public Schools conducted its first virtual learning day since 2020, and district officials were pleased with the results, according to TCPS Directer of Communications Debbie Gardner.\n\"The feedback from school principals has been positive,\" Gardner said Wednesday afternoon. \"Student attendance has been better than we anticipated, and our teachers have done a fantastic job.\"\nDorchester County Public Schools conducted a virtual learning day as well, but could not be reached for comment.\nCaroline County Public Schools did not have students attend class virtually, but the district plans to open on time Thursday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "At Daysprings Townhomes, poor housing conditions persist\n\n February 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 1351\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY — Phillip Gibson often walks around the complex where he lives, checking in on his neighbors at the Dayspring Townhomes. He's recognizable and trusted by neighbors, many of whom call him \"Pappy.\"Last October, the retired maintenance worker walked around the complex and into some of his neighbors' units, pointing out what looked like mold above the shower of a second-floor bathroom.\nHe repeated one word that encapsulates how he and many others view the living conditions at the low-income complex: \"Unacceptable.\"\n\"I've only been living out here for eight months,\" Gibson said in October. \"This is what I'm seeing. This is crazy. This is crazy, and I've been a maintenance man for 40 years.\"\nGibson isn't alone, as other residents of the Caroline County-owned complex have voiced similar concerns.\nDuring recent months, dialogue surrounding the 46-unit operation has picked up among housing and social activists, disgruntled tenants and Caroline County officials. Property management has sought to collect unpaid rents while many tenants point to poor housing conditions and unresponsive maintenance requests.\nOwned by the county, the property is run by East Coast Property Management, a Delaware-based company. In November, the Dayspring Townhomes filed 23 complaints against residents for failure to pay rent.\nShore Legal Access and Maryland Legal Aid took on cases for residents that accepted their legal services. Some cases were dismissed, while others were ruled in favor of the landlord. A number of tenants agreed to rent payment agreements.\nCounty officials say only around half of the units are currently occupied and collecting rent. Some of the vacated units have extensive damage stemming from evicted tenants, Caroline County Administrator Katheleen Freeman said at a Feb. 4 county meeting.\nWhile the county explores the possibility of selling the property to a qualified nonprofit, some residents remain confused and frustrated with lacking maintenance and communication.\nGibson said he wants the units fixed up, and that at times, property management has been putting \"a Band-Aid on a little sore\" when it comes to addressing issues.\n\"I can't let these people live like this,\" he said.\nLIVING CONDITIONS\nThe Dayspring Townhomes complex is located just outside Ridgely on School Street. The initial property was built in 1994 by Interfaith Housing Development, a former local nonprofit that worked with the county, according to Caroline County Commissioners Vice President Larry Porter.\nThat nonprofit ceased operations a handful of years ago, leaving the low-income housing complex in the hands of its owners, Caroline County, and the contracted property management company, East Coast.\nIn October, Caroline County paid for First State Inspection Agency, based in Milford, Delaware, to perform unit-by-unit inspections.\nOf the complex's 46 units, inspection records showed common damages in a number of units: cracked window surfaces, doors off their frames and damaged outlets or light switch covers. Some apartments had damaged or worn stairs.\nNone of the units had smoke detectors in the bedrooms, which Caroline County and property management remedied in the days after inspection.\nManizh Brown, a former tenant, lived at Dayspring for more than a year with her two children. In her townhome, an electrical outlet was faulty, closet doors were broken and the ceiling leaked where the second-floor bathtub sits.\n\"Everybody else got similar … problems. Especially this,\" Brown said while standing in her then-apartment, pointing to the leaks. \"This is really getting me.\"\nBrown said many of the issues with her townhome existed when she moved in. Aside from her floor, which she said was upgraded, Brown said there weren't sufficient improvements.\n\"The health situation right here, the water and everything else. F. F-minus,\" Brown said. \"Ain't no way I should move in, and there's mold already on my window sill.\"\nCaroline County officials have labeled the Dayspring Townhomes as high priority, facilitating the inspections last fall and consistently checking in with property management and the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development.\n\"We want those units to be in good shape,\" said Porter, the Caroline commissioner. During recent meetings, the county has focused on facilitating renovation of heavily damaged units.\nSome residents hold concerns about physical safety, as well. A non-fatal shooting outside of the complex last August intensified those worries. The county purchased security cameras, which were placed at the front of the complex.\nCaroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker has remained in contact with Bridge Maryland Inc., a Baltimore County nonprofit that's held meetings for residents to air concerns and is assisting tenants with the court process.\nSome tenants and nearby homeowners participate in neighborhood association meetings, during which they discuss their concerns about violence, drug use and large parties in or outside of the Dayspring Townhomes.\nIn October, resident Trina Ewell said the shooting was still affecting her peace of mind, and her son's as well.\n\"You're just at your own risk,\" Ewell said. \"And I do know that my son has increased with panic attacks because of the shooting.\"\nPROPERTY MANAGEMENT\nEast Coast Property Management, which manages the Dayspring complex, has more than 50 rental properties across Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, according to its website.\nDespite repeated attempts to reach the property manager or a company representative, East Coast Property Management did not respond to The Star Democrat's requests for an interview or comment.\nResidents have raised concerns about a lack of communication with property management, the property manager and maintenance workers.\n\"We have not heard from anybody, letters, emails,\" Ewell said last fall.\nBrown said in order to place maintenance requests, she called the \"maintenance man\" or the property manager, as there was no standard maintenance order procedure.\n\"You ain't got to do no type of papers, no work (order), just tell them,\" Brown said. Often, she considered doing some of the maintenance fixes herself.\nRachel Wolpert, a chief attorney at Maryland Legal Aid who has worked with landlord and tenant issues since 2008, says it's an \"incredibly relationship-based business.\"\nWolpert acknowledged it's a difficult task to be a property manager at any apartment or multifamily complex. She notes, though, that clear communication and follow-through from property management are critical.\n\"I see successes when the on-site manager is accessible and responsive to tenants,\" Wolpert said. \"And then you see real troubles where tenants feel like the on-site manager is not accessible, not responsive.\"\nRecently, tenants were notified monthly rent rates would increase. Porter said since there are no rent subsidies, but also an income threshold tenants must be below, a tight window exists of those who qualify but can still meet rent payments.\nBridge Maryland Board of Directors President the Rev. Angelique Mason said in an interview that rent payments and fear of eviction both play a role in how outspoken residents feel they can be.\n\"We do know that some of them are not being vocal because they might be behind in their rent,\" Mason said. \"They had this idea that they might be evicted if they speak up. And that's really why Bridge is being the voice for the people, because some of them do have fear of eviction.\"\nWHAT'S NEXT?\nWhile Caroline County owns the property, the option for that to change is up in the air.\n\"Our position at this point that we're going to express is the possibility of selling that property to a qualified nonprofit organization,\" Porter said at a November county meeting. \"The question we need to have answered is the mortgage amount.\"\nPorter calls it a \"tough situation\" because of that mortgage conundrum. The state has involvement with the property, he said, binding the county to have at least a portion of ownership and the apartments to be low-income in order for the mortgage to remain deferred.\nAs the county has been in consistent dialogue with Maryland Housing and Community Development, many tenants faced court proceedings at the end of 2024.\nBridge Maryland organizer Hannah Freeman, who has facilitated community meetings, assisted many tenants during the court process. She said while some owed thousands in rent, others owed less than property management alleged.\nFreeman says she remains focused on helping those who need it most.\n\"There's people just out homes,\" Freeman said. \" … These are people with kids, with legitimate complaints about management.\"\nEwell acknowledged that amid her concerns regarding safety and the complex's living conditions, there isn't always another option.\n\"You got to live somewhere,\" Ewell said. \"Right now, during this time with everything, you have to. You have to live somewhere.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

But in any community, there are some very strong personalities, and Cambridge is no different.\"\nSteckman said it's not realistic to ask for everyone to \"sing by the same song sheet.\"\n\"But how do we work better together?\" he asked.\nCambridge Mayor Lajan Cephas said Steckman has made an effort to work with the many different communities within Cambridge, from the Black community to the Hispanic community to the senior community to different neighborhoods.\n\"When you seek different perspectives, it always gives the best outcome,\" Cephas said. \"Even myself as a Black woman. If I just go about my day every day from the perspective of a Black woman, I'm going to miss some things. So that's why it's always important to have a diverse staff, a diverse group of people that you can rely on to get information from.\"\nStarting this Saturday, Feb. 15, Steckman will be at City Hall from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. one or two Saturdays per month to speak with any residents who aren't able to see him during the normal week day. Steckman has also made it easier for residents to come to City Hall by making it so they don't need to be buzzed in at the door. The city has also put in a railing and an automatic door opener for accessibility at City Hall.\n\"Because I try to maintain an open door policy,\" he said about the changes. \"But I want to talk with people. ... I'm not a huge fan of just emails back and forth.\"\nBorn and raised in Baltimore, with experience serving on the Ocean City Council and a career spent managing cities as far away as Alaska, Steckman is no stranger to Maryland nor city management. In his free time, along with spending time with his wife and their two dogs, Steckman enjoys reading.\nHe said it's important to read about what's going on not only in his community, but in surrounding communities.\n\"We are not some little isolated community,\" he said. \"And sometimes people in other communities have very good ideas that maybe we can export here or modify what they're doing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Maryland considers shake-up in how judges are picked",
    "date": "2025-02-18",
    "author": "PAUL KIEFER Capital News Service",
    "content": "Maryland considers shake-up in how judges are picked\n\n February 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PAUL KIEFER Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1253\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Maryland lawmakers are weighing two bills this year that would shake up how the state chooses circuit court judges.The proposals are at odds with one another. One bill aims to adjust the existing contested election process for circuit court judges by opening primaries to all Maryland voters. The other would eliminate contested circuit court elections altogether — a shift that would require a constitutional amendment.\nThe proposals represent two sides of a decades-long debate in the Maryland General Assembly about the value of contested circuit court elections.\nSome members of Maryland's judiciary argue doing away with judicial elections entirely would shield judges from the ethical and practical challenges involved in competitive political campaigns.\n\"The job of a judge is, or at least should be, inherently apolitical,\" said Maryland Supreme Court Chief Justice Matthew J. Fader.\nOthers stand by Maryland's approach to filling circuit court benches, arguing that contested elections are a valuable opportunity for voters to shape their judiciary.\nCircuit court judges are currently the only Maryland court to run in contested elections. All other state courts fill their benches with judges appointed by the governor, giving voters a say in whether those judges hold their seats in retention elections every 10 years. But the judges run unopposed and, at least according to some of the state's leading legal experts, no Maryland judge has been ousted in a retention election in living memory.\nWhile the governor appoints judges to fill vacancies on circuit courts, the state constitution requires those judges stand for reelection every 15 years — elections in which they, unlike any other Maryland judge, can face a challenger.\nThe conversation about the system's merits has restarted among Maryland lawmakers, with Fader and other prominent Maryland legal figures backing a bill that would change circuit courts' process for filling benches to match the rest of Maryland courts.\nThe proposal arose from a work group formed by the Maryland Judicial Conference three years ago to review the issue. The work group released its final report — which argued that Maryland should move away from contested circuit court elections — last year.\n\"We believe that this is the best solution to maintain public trust and confidence in the court and in its ability to have judges who are fully qualified to take office in all cases,\" Fader told members of the House Judiciary Committee in a preliminary hearing on the bill.\nProponents of the bill assert that contested elections for circuit court positions open the bench to candidates who are unqualified for the role.\n\"Our system allows individuals with little to no judicial experience to challenge sitting judges,\" said Prince George's County Circuit Court Judge Cheri Simpkins. That means some judges who were initially appointed to their seat \"must run against opponents who only meet the minimum qualifications of being a licensed person residing in the county for five years and paying a nominal filing fee,\" she added.\nMaryland State Bar Association President Raphael Santini pointed to former Prince George's County Circuit Court Judge April Ademiluyi, who won her seat in a contested election in 2020 and whose \"egregious\" violations of judicial ethics prompted the Maryland Supreme Court to remove her from the bench in 2024.\nAppointed judges, Santini told Capital News Service, have passed through a rigorous vetting process run by a judicial nominating commission and more than a dozen committees within the state's bar association. That vetting is done by fellow attorneys from a variety of legal fields who are well-equipped to review a candidate's legal and personal record, he added.\nElizabeth Hewlett, an attorney in Prince George's County and supporter of the proposal, said that voter participation in circuit court races is vastly lower than participation in better-publicized races, in large part because judges' schedules and ethics code leave them poorly positioned to campaign.\nCampaigning in competitive elections, said Kelly Hughes Iverson, co-chair of the Maryland State Bar Association's laws committee, can place judges in ethically compromising positions.\n\"When the courts are fundraising, the appearance of sitting judges accepting campaign donations from contributors, which includes attorneys and litigants who have cases before them, undermines the public trust in an independent judiciary, and may discourage candidates from applying for the bench at all,\" Iverson said.\nAttorneys are more engaged in judicial elections than the general public, Santini said, and more likely to contribute to a judge's campaign.\nBackers also argue that judges, who routinely receive threats from those impacted by their decisions, put their safety at risk when campaigning for reelection.\nBut not all members of the judiciary are on board with the proposed changes.\n\"All it does is remove any opportunity for anyone to challenge the person that is named by the governor,\" said Carroll County Circuit Court Judge Maria Oesterreicher, who won her seat in a 2018 contested election and served on the judicial workgroup that put forward the bill.\nCritics like Oesterreicher argue while circuit court elections are imperfect, they are also a rare opportunity for voters to play a larger role in shaping Maryland's judiciary.\nIf lawmakers are concerned about the qualifications of judicial candidates, she argued, they could require candidates to go through the same vetting process as applicants for appointed seats.\n\"That's an easy solution, but we've jumped right to the extreme,\" Oesterreicher said. \"I think taking the rights out of the voters' hands is not the right way to fix the problem of judges campaigning if that's the problem that people want to fix.\"\nSkeptics asserted that the appointment process is far from perfect, in large part because it relies on a relatively small group of attorneys to review and recommend candidates. Those attorneys, critics argue, may choose favorites based on politics or personal relationships rather than qualifications.\n\"It is clubby,\" said Claudia Barber, who ran unsuccessfully for an Anne Arundel Circuit Court seat last year. \"It is also political … which is why, oftentimes, the best is not always chosen.\"\n\"I ran against someone who was the third member of the same law firm to be on the bench that only has four seats,\" Oesterreicher said of her 2018 campaign. The appointment process can favor well-connected attorneys over those with equal or greater qualifications, she argued.\nDel. Robin Grammer Jr., a Republican representing Baltimore County, offered harsher criticisms. He argued that the proposal to end contested circuit court elections would primarily benefit the judges, not the public.\n\"Elections are hard,\" he told CNS. \"You don't get to exempt yourself out of the system and have, frankly, what ends up being a lifetime appointment just because you think it's hard … When is the last time a judge has lost a retention election, like, ever?\"\nGrammer also contended that judges could avoid ethical concerns about campaign contributions from attorneys by finding alternative fundraising options.\nLawmakers skeptical of eliminating contested circuit court elections have another option this year: expanding voters' input in circuit court primaries.\nDel. Chao Wu, a Democrat representing Howard and Montgomery County, is the sponsor of a bill that would replace Maryland's closed partisan primaries for circuit court elections with open, nonpartisan primaries. Closed primaries leave unaffiliated voters — who make up nearly a quarter of the state's electorate — without a voice in key local races, Wu said.\n\"I think a lot of unaffiliated voters feel they're really disenfranchised,\" Wu told CNS. \"They're not able to vote in (primaries for) one of the most important positions in the state.\"\nWu's bill received no pushback from members of the House Judiciary Committee, but lawmakers have yet to act on either bill.\nIf the proposal to end contested circuit court elections passes this session, the question will appear on Maryland voters' ballots in November 2026. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Developers from The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, the project's developer, agreed to work on alternative options for the unapproved building and return to the commission at a future date.\nLargely, the commission applauded developers for their advanced outreach to the community, as well as what they called an attractive project aimed at addressing Easton's lack of affordable housing.\n\"I love the project,\" commission chair Philip Toussaint said. \"I think the positive aspects of it far outweigh any negative aspects. We have to take that into account when we're making a decision.\"\nToussaint joined vice chair Michael Ports, William Ryall and Victoria McAndrews in approving the project with the exception of Building 409. Thomas Klein was the sole vote against, citing his concerns that the plan's 217 off-street parking spots won't suffice once the units are occupied and commercial tenants move in.\nThe proposal noted 49 on-street parking spaces along Brookletts Avenue are mostly unused right now and would provide additional parking once renters and businesses move into Easton Crossing.\nKlein said only 217 dedicated spaces for a 229-bedroom development did not seem sufficient, particularly if the backup plan is parking on Brookletts.\n\"If people from the development start to go and park in those areas, the tenants that live there now are not going to have any place to park,\" Klein said.\nRoss Benincasa, senior vice president of Chesapeake Community Development, presented the site plan at Thursday's meeting. It calls for 30% of the rental units to be affordably priced, with others at workforce and market-rate levels.\nDemolition of the Perdue grain bins and storage buildings currently on the lot began this month. Apartments are expected to be available beginning in 2027.\nSpeaking to the commission Thursday, Benincasa said the nonprofit developers felt a \"necessary duty\" to make a dent in Easton's affordable housing crisis with the infill project.\n\"We really felt kind of a need to make sure that if this was going to be developed, that we thought of it more inclusively,\" Benincasa said, \"and more geared around making sure there was housing provided for all income levels, including people with disabilities.\"\nBLENDING INWhile many complimented the project's cohesion with the intersecting Rails to Trails, worries centered around the fact that the structures don't integrate into the neighboring historic community.\nTalbot County Council Member Lynn Mielke, speaking for herself and not the council, said the project is \"incompatible\" and its architecture ignores the nearby residential buildings.\nToussaint pushed Benincasa on if it was appropriate for the project to face away from The Hill, one of the first free African American neighborhoods in the country. The commission chair said that's been a significant source of public input.\n\"It appears to me that you've turned your back on the existing community, The Hill district,\" Toussaint said. \"And you focus on Rails to Trails, and did a wonderful job of that.\"\nBenincasa said The Arc doesn't own a lot of land in The Hill community to be able to integrate with it and that he disagrees with sentiments that the project doesn't fit into the surrounding fabric.\n\"We are not necessarily in that community here, and I would go as far to say as I think that doing duplexes here or mimicking that in some way would kind of really negatively offset what we could do in terms of usable units,\" Benincasa said. \"It's never been a serious consideration.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Oxford residents share thoughts on who should be allowed to vote in town elections\n\n February 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 731\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — At a Commissioners of Oxford public hearing Tuesday evening, it all boiled down to the question of who should have the right to vote in town elections.The public hearing was held for a resolution that would amend the town's charter to clarify a person must register with the Talbot County Board of Elections to qualify as a voter in the town. This means a resident would not be able to vote in Oxford town elections if they aren't registered with the county board.\nThe commissioners opted not to vote on the resolution during the meeting.\n\"Listening to this conversation, it seems like we're putting the cart before the horse,\" Resident Warren Davis said during the public hearing. \"What we really want to do is figure out who we want to vote in our elections.\"\nOxford Town Attorney Lyndsey Ryan said registering with the Talbot County Board of Elections means an Oxford resident is declaring their home in Oxford as their domicile, or primary residence. She said that when a person registers in Talbot County, they are removed from any voting registry they may have been on elsewhere.\nCurrently, the town charter states a person should register in the town office. The charter says it is the duty of Oxford's Election Board to keep registration lists up to date.\nWhen it comes to eligibility, the charter states a person is able to vote if they are a U.S. citizen, are at least 18 and have resided in the town for at least 30 days prior to any town election.\nAt the outset of the public hearing, Ryan said the commissioners could choose to take a different path than the resolution presented.\nCommissioner Katrina Greer brought up her concern that the list of registered voters in Talbot County is not always updated.\n\"As residents in a very small town, I know who lives here, I know who died this year,\" she said. \"And so it's much easier for our own board of elections to clean up those voter logs.\"\nResidents who spoke at the public hearing brought up scenarios and shared thoughts on who should and shouldn't be able to vote in town elections.\nAfter confirming Oxford commissioners serve all proprietors and renters in town, Dan Kordell said anyone who owns or rents property in town should have a say in who is serving them.\n\"It's about representation,\" he said.\nJim Wilcox asked the commissioners to focus on who should vote based on \"who has skin in the game.\" He said property owners and people with leases for more than 30 days should be able to vote in town elections.\n\"I would say somebody who has maybe a six-month lease,\" he said. \"Something that shows a substantial term commitment to Oxford rather than just landing here for 30 days.\"\nWarren Davis brought up that there are multiple residents in town with more than one residence. He included himself in the category, saying he usually goes to Maine in the summer.\n\"Should I be allowed to vote in Oxford because I'm not here for 30 days before the election?\" he asked.\nMultiple residents spoke to the issue of whether residents away at college should be able to vote in town elections. David Donovan said he doesn't think these students should be able to vote in town elections.\n\"They don't have any skin in the game,\" he said. \"They don't have any intention to move back here. ... So I don't think those people should be allowed to vote here.\"\nChris Maynard said that could be considered disenfranchisement.\n\"We should keep in mind that 18-year-olds, we're referring to them as children, but they're really adults,\" she said, later adding, \"It's not that the parents drive them over to the voting place and tell them what to do.\"\nDonovan said he has an alternative to the town's proposed resolution. He proposed the town instead amend the voting eligibility section in the charter to say that voters should be physically present in their Oxford residence 30 days prior to the election unless they are absent due to vacation or circumstances beyond their control.\nHe said residents absent from town for those 30 days due to \"voluntary enrollment in any education program\" should not be considered eligible to vote.\nDonovan said the town should add an application for absentee voting that requires absentee voters to affirm they are eligible to vote.\nAfter the public hearing, the commissioners agreed to schedule a work session to discuss the issue further. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Residents challenge solar project over zoning, health risks\n\n February 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 548\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Maryland Public Service Commission heard residents' concerns Tuesday over a proposed community solar project on 41 acres of a 199-acre property at 10066 Peacock Corner Road in Millington, owned by David Chance.The project, designated TPE MD KE51, is being developed by Turning Point Energy (TPE), a renewable energy firm that has spearheaded several solar initiatives in Maryland, including a second proposal in Kennedyville. According to company information, Turning Point focuses on sustainable, ground-mounted solar projects designed to expand clean energy access in the region.\nMore than a dozen residents gathered at Galena Elementary School at 7 p.m. for the PSC hearing, moderated by Chief Public Utility Law Judge Chuck McLean. In addition to Turning Point representatives, legal counsel, and project managers, officials from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Kent County Attorney Tom Yeager and Planning, Housing and Zoning deputy Carla Gerber were in attendance.\nAfter brief introductions by Turning Point's team, Yeager and Gerber outlined the county's position. Yeager noted that local zoning restricts solar projects in this agriculture district to five acres and contended that Turning Point should have applied for a special exception. Project manager Frances Yuhas said the company was aware of the five‐acre limit for utility-scale solar in the district and chose not to seek an exception, adding that final approval lies with the Public Service Commission under state preemption.\nResident Darryl Calloway expressed his concern, saying, \"I would love someone to address the health concerns I have such as microwaves. Anyone who lives near these arrays, what happens to them?\"\nCertified solar thermal engineer Dick Durham raised additional issues about panel efficiency and recycling challenges, noting that the panels contain materials such as lead and cadmium telluride. He also warned that pending legislation, Senate Bill 0931, could reshape land-use controls in ways reminiscent of eminent domain.\nWhen asked about the origin of the panels, Yuhas said production could occur in the United States but noted that international manufacturing — including in Mexico or China —remains a possibility. Maryland Department of Natural Resources official Ginny Rogers addressed environmental risk concerns, stating, \"From what we see there is no risk at all involved,\" and outlined plans to plant native, pollinator-friendly ground cover to boost biodiversity.\nKennedyville resident Judi Gifford questioned the economic benefits of the array, asking, \"Are there any savings for residents at all?\" Yuhas replied that subscribers to the power would be guaranteed a 5 to 10 percent discount over a 25-year subscription. Gerber added that the county would likely reclassify the property as commercial rather than agricultural, potentially increasing tax revenue.\nAt the hearing, Turning Point announced they committed to a $52,000 donation to Kent County's agricultural preservation program — a request based on state law calculations of agricultural value. Representatives from the company stayed afterward to discuss next steps pending a PSC decision on their certificate of public convenience and necessity.\nWhen asked how they felt the county received their project proposal, TPE representative, Attorney Margaret Witherup of Witherup Allen Law admitted, \"It's hard to tell. Each site is different.\"\nNo other comment were received from Turning Point legal counsel, Attorney Witherup, or from representatives at Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. Kent County officials said they will continue to monitor developments in the project. More details can be found under Case No. 9742 at the Maryland PSC website. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

MICHAELS — On Wednesday, St. Michaels officials held their third discussion of Noise Ordnance 567, which deals with gasoline-powered leaf blowers.Residents have voiced their concerns about gas leaf blowers being very loud and being used at especially early or late hours, concerns the new ordinance aims to address.\n\"So I think the main challenge from a policy standpoint is the impacts on local commercial lawn care companies by requiring electric leaf blowers,\" Town Administrator Rob Straebel said. \"But for non commercial users such as residents and property owners, this could be a fairly easy transition.\"\nThe conversation surrounding limiting leaf blowers was first brought up on Oct. 25, 2023 but stopped after commercial landscape operators said they couldn't do their job properly with electric leaf blowers. The conversation was brought back up on Jan. 22, this time aimed at just gas-powered leaf blowers, which are usually noisier.\nThe commissioners would take into the consideration that residents would need to purchase electric leaf blowers, they said, by ensuring it does not go into effect for another year or two. Noise levels for electric or battery leaf blowers will have to be limited to 65 decibels.\nContractors and St. Michaels public works officials argued that gas leaf blowers makes their jobs easier. Electric or battery powered leaf blowers must be charged, which takes time. They also argued that gas-powered leaf blowers are more powerful and help them accomplish their jobs faster.\nCommissioner Alex Roiter argued that the contractors and workers are wasting time by just blowing a couple of leafs with the gas blower.\nPublic Works Operational Manager Brian Thompson pushed back and explained that \"most contractors are not going to waste time. They want to get in and get out because it's money flow.\"\nThompson said he is not against electric leaf blowers but that there are certain times when gas-powered equipment is needed.\nAfter back-and-forth, the officials decided the ordinance needed some work because it did not properly explain what equipment can be used and by whom.\nThe commissioners decided to table the conversation for another meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Each community would still exist within the new town. The planners believe incorporation would give the area a better chance of receiving funding from government agencies.\nMarch 3, the planners shared their vision and heard from residents of the communities that Blackwater would encompass. Residents raised concerns about taxes, money management, residency requirements and the incorporation process. With multiple residents in the room opposed to the idea, tension ebbed and flowed throughout the meeting.\nDuring a tense portion, with some residents visibly upset and yelling, Chuckie Hayward said he was tired of the \"bickering.\" He said although he's against the idea to incorporate, he came to listen.\n\"I'm here because I want to hear everything out first before I really make a decision,\" he said.\nMany residents shared concerns with having to pay taxes to the town. The Dawsons and Beverley have said the town would not impose new taxes.\nDrew Dawson said 60% of residents would have to vote in favor of being taxed in order for the town to impose taxes. He said he doesn't see that happening.\nCounty resident Matt Ritter said taxes often arise when communities experience growth.\n\"Once you allow building and allow all this excess to happen, growth comes down here and this becomes just like Cambridge,\" he said. \"And then you've got all these city folk down here trying to change things up. And they always raise their hand to raise the taxes.\"\nFormer Cambridge Mayor Andrew Bradshaw, who shared his understanding of municipalities at the meeting, said the town would be able to secure federal and state funding that is only open to municipalities.\n\"If you all can get the kind of representation this would provide, it gives a force behind the effort that just doesn't exist right now,\" Bradshaw said.\nIn order for Blackwater to get incorporated, the planners need to gather signatures on a petition, then go to the county to submit the drafted town charter for review. If the county accepts the charter, the decision will go to the registered voters within the area that Blackwater would encompass.\nResident Scott Hughes spoke about the importance of forming the town the right way and having a \"bulletproof\" charter. He said he expects the push to create Blackwater will be a success.\n\"But let's make it happen so that nobody can take advantage of it,\" he said.\nLindsay Wheatley said she sees three options for the communities: Sell all the land to sika deer hunters who want to strip away houses and put up deer stands, stay and not do anything as roads and the area's heritage crumble, or fight.\n\"This might be our only opportunity ever,\" she said. \"We're dwindling. Look around, right? I chose to come back here because I love it, and all of you love it too. I'm going to fight. I'm going to sign it. I'm going to do everything that I can do with integrity and honesty to protect this area for as long as I can.\"\nDrew Dawson said he and the other planners will discuss the ideas raised during the meeting and decide how to amend the draft charter.\n\"I think there are some pretty good ideas,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Proposed tax breaks could mean service cuts in lower-income counties\n\n March 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PAUL KIEFER Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 963\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Gov. Wes Moore plans to change how Marylanders take deductions on their state income taxes, but officials in some of the state's poorest counties say that plan could force them to cut services.\"You mentioned that the federal government is creating chaos for our state government in an effort to balance their budget,\" Del. Jefferson Ghrist, a Republican representing Caroline, Cecil, Kent and Queen Anne's Counties, told Gov. Moore in a recent budget hearing. \"It appears that your budget does sort of the same thing to our county governments.\"\nMoore's administration, however, contends that the reforms will provide tax relief to a majority of Marylanders — including residents of lower-income counties — even if those county governments face a revenue loss.\n\"This proposal leaves more cash in the pockets of the majority of Maryland's households,\" said Budget and Management Secretary Helene Grady.\nLawmakers in Annapolis are weighing a two-pronged approach to tax reform intended to shift the scales in favor of low- and middle-income households.\nMoore's proposal to double the state's standard deduction would provide a tax break to Marylanders who opt not to itemize their income tax deductions — many of them low- and middle-income. To account for the resulting revenue loss, the governor's office proposes ending the practice of itemized deductions, which would mean a larger income tax bill for many high-income Marylanders.\nBut county governments also collect income taxes, and a tax break for lower-income Marylanders would deal a blow to some counties' budgets.\nRepresentatives from Allegany County appeared in Annapolis last week to ask lawmakers to soften that blow.\n\"Governor Moore discussed the idea that no Marylanders should be left behind,\" Allegany County Attorney T. Lee Beeman told lawmakers on Friday. \"Ultimately, his proposal this year will do exactly that in Allegany County. It will leave Allegany County behind.\"\nIf the General Assembly moves forward with doubling the standard deduction, Allegany County would stand to lose $3.2 million in revenue next year, according to Maryland's Board of Revenue Estimates.\nWhile the vast majority of county residents would receive a tax cut, \"we'll be looking at probably cutting potentially each and every service we have,\" said Allegany County Administrator Jason Bennett. \"We're pretty slim as it is.\"\nLast year, the county laid off emergency services staff and scaled back employee health insurance in response to a $13 million deficit. Additional cuts could mean scaling back snow clearance operations in the winter, public transit service and support for the county's library service, he told Capital News Service.\nIf Allegany County raised local income taxes to the maximum rate allowed under Maryland law, he added, the county could only make up for half of the projected losses created by doubling the standard deduction.\nAllegany County is not alone. Del. Malcolm Ruff, a Democrat representing Baltimore City, noted that doubling the standard deduction could undercut services in his district.\n\"Baltimore City would lose approximately $40 million over the next five years based on those changes,\" Ruff said.\nThe Board of Revenue Estimates projects that half of Maryland's counties and county equivalents would lose income tax revenue if the state moves forward with the proposed changes to deductions. Those include all but one of the 10 poorest Maryland counties as of the Census Bureau's 2023 American Community Survey.\n\"Contrast that with our friends in the beltway corridor,\" said Beeman. \"Montgomery County stands to gain $300 million in income tax revenue over the next five years. It's a shocking contrast.\"\nMeanwhile, some members of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland have expressed concerns that eliminating itemized deductions would have a disproportionate impact on majority-Black districts in the Washington suburbs.\nResidents of Charles and Prince George's Counties itemize their deductions at higher rates than residents of any other Maryland counties. That presents a political challenge for someone like Sen. Michael Jackson, a Democrat representing parts of Calvert, Charles and Prince George's Counties. Residents in those districts are more likely than other Marylanders to see their tax bills increase under Moore's plan.\nJackson told CNS that he and other caucus members representing those counties are in talks with the governor to address their concerns.\nBut Moore's current proposals drew praise from some outside observers.\n\"Itemized deductions are regressive,\" said Miles Trinidad, a state policy analyst with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan think tank. \"These policies offer the largest benefits to higher income taxpayers and little if any benefits to low- and middle-income families.\"\nGrady, meanwhile, notes that the governor's tax reforms would offer a tax cut to a majority of Marylanders, and that aid to local governments accounts for a third of general fund expenses in the proposed 2026 budget — aid that would support both public school systems and county governments.\nThe governor's office also underscores that Maryland's standard deduction is only a third of Virginia's, meaning that some poor and working-class residents who would pay no income tax in Virginia make enough to pay income tax in Maryland.\nWhile Moore's proposal would still leave Maryland's standard deduction lower than those in Virginia and Washington, his office argues the change is in the interest of fairness.\nHowever, given the dire state of Maryland's budget and the prospect of dwindling federal support, Grady also noted that the state may not be in a position to simultaneously offer tax cuts to most Marylanders and shield counties from the statewide budget crunch.\n\"Given the general fund challenge, it would be very difficult to insulate counties entirely from impacts,\" she said.\nSenate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat representing Baltimore City, echoed Grady's sentiment.\n\"I appreciate [the governor's] approach of bringing forth a proposal that attempted to balance state needs, local needs and our business climate,\" he said. \"But we're dealing with an unprecedented situation, and so just as the state is having to tighten the belt. I think local jurisdictions are going to be in a similar place this upcoming year.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Town Council holds off on confirming County Council vice president to utilities commission\n\n March 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 597\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — While board and commission appointments typically pass by the Easton Town Council with little to no discussion, such was not the case at Monday's meeting.Some councilmembers raised concerns over Mayor Megan Cook's appointment of Pete Lesher to the Easton Utilities Commission, ultimately deciding to hold off on confirming that appointment. Lesher is the vice president of the Talbot County Council.\nTown Council President Frank Gunsallus asked Cook if her appointment went through staff review. Cook said it went through a review process with Easton Utilities and she met with John Horner, the nonprofit's president and CEO.\nGunsallus asked if Lesher would step down from his county seat. \"I do not believe so,\" Cook responded.\n\"He swore an oath to the county, and sometimes we have competing interests,\" Gunsallus later said. \"And he can't have two masters. I think there will be a conflict when land needs to be resumed for solar, as is currently in the legislature. So I think that that is something that we should be considering.\"\nLesher was appointed to fill the role of current commission member Buck Duncan, whose term expires this May.\nTown Attorney Sharon VanEmburgh said at Monday's meeting it wasn't fully clear whether there were legal issues with Lesher being on the County Council and potentially the Easton Utilities Commission.\nVanEmburgh said the state's constitution doesn't allow someone to hold two \"trust and profit\" offices. The question in need of answering is whether the commission post would be considered such.\n\"I think we would probably get to the conclusion that it is not a second office of trust and profit,\" VanEmburgh said. \"But I just don't know.\"\nGunsallus suggested the appointment go through both the town and county's ethics commissions. Ward 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry said if VanEmburgh returns with an opinion that supports the appointment as legal, she sees \"no need for an ethics review on a local basis.\"\nWard 4 Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis said it's \"vital and important\" for the town to ensure it's \"on the right side of the law.\" Councilmembers agreed to address Lesher's appointment at the town's next meeting once legal advice is obtained.\n\"As always, we respect the Mayor and support the members of the Town Council and their decisions,\" Horner wrote in a statement Wednesday. \"The appointment and confirmation of an Easton Utilities' Commissioner is an essential step in ensuring the efficient and effective management of our operations.\"\nOTHER APPOINTMENTS\nDuring the discussion, Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery said he feels appointments are already a \"rubber stamp\" by the time they hit the council's desk.\n\"I would really like to have an opportunity to have some discussion with the mayor … in an executive session,\" Montgomery said, \"just to hear your thoughts about different candidates rather than always having one candidate put in front of us.\"\nCook said during appointment processes, there's a \"lot of thought\" that goes into candidates and resumes.\n\"It's not something that we take lightly,\" Cook said.\nMontgomery said he hopes the opportunity for such conversations will be afforded to the council during interviews for the town manager role. Cook said the council will have chances to meet candidates, adding that there will be full-day interviews.\nIt's been seven months since the town parted with its most recent full-time manager, Don Richardson, on Aug. 5, 2024. Police Chief Alan Lowrey has served in an interim capacity since.\nLast December, Easton announced it opened a search for a new town manager. The town secured the services of the professional recruitment agency Sumter Local Government Consulting.\nWednesday, Cook told The Star Democrat that the town has narrowed its search down to a group of semifinalists. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) and the Trump administration outside a fundraiser hosted by Harris at the Tidewater Inn.By 5 p.m., a large crowd gathered outside the Talbot County Democratic Party headquarters and began walking down sidewalks and past the Tidewater.\nThey repeated chants of \"Andy Harris has got to go\" and \"fire Andy Harris.\" Some called for the congressman, who represents the Eastern Shore of Maryland, to host a town hall.\nPhil Jackson, chair of the Talbot Democratic Central Committee, said Harris is \"absolutely failing to represent Talbot County.\"\n\"Andy Harris has historically done very little for the Eastern Shore,\" Jackson said. \"... I think this is indicative of a very strong desire for new leadership.\"\nBy 6:30 p.m., Harris' event inside the inn continued and most of the crowd had dispersed. The large crowd did not appear to encounter Harris at any point Thursday evening.\nFollowing his event, Harris told The Star Democrat that the Eastern Shore elected him and President Donald Trump, and that he's \"delivering on President Trump's agenda.\"\nAmong the president's agenda items raised by protesters Thursday was the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk and mass firings of federal workers. Many of the more than 300 protesters held signs opposing DOGE.\n\"I think folks have had enough with the current administration and the overreach and behavior we're seeing right now,\" Jackson said.\nHarris, meanwhile, said the cuts are necessary due to a federal deficit nearing $2 trillion.\n\"If they want to help us with some way to make the government more efficient — other than actually letting go of people whose jobs are probably not contributing to government efficiency — I'm all ears,\" Harris said of those who oppose the firings. \"But they're not offering solutions.\"\n\"I feel bad for anyone who's losing a job, but I'm hoping with the economic growth we have, we're going to provide plenty of private sector jobs for those leaving the federal government,\" he added.\nHarris, who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, met with Trump at the White House Wednesday. He said people at his fundraiser Thursday were excited to hear about what's going on in Washington, D.C.\n\"I told them some of what it's like to be sitting next to the leader of the free world,\" Harris said.\nOutside the Tidewater, the tenor from protesters was much different. The crowd of hundreds loudly cheered as cars drove by and honked in support of the protest.\nJackson was pleased with the large turnout and says the protest was a \"tipping point.\"\n\"It's really reached an egregious point,\" Jackson said. \"And I think people are really upset about it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The new section will allow the Department of Planning and Codes to deny applications if an applicant is not within code or zoning compliance of the county on that same property.\n\"If you had a violation on your property, let's say you put a pool in without a permit and it's unresolved,\" Batts said, \"now you come in and you want to seek a permit for something else, we would not grant that permit until you updated or gotten your proper permits for the other structure.\"\nIf a resident comes into fix a violation, the county will permit to allow the resolution of the violation.\nAlso covered in the proposed bill if an applicant has multiple properties they can apply for permits on one property and not be denied because of a violation on another property.\nBoth proposed bills will move on for the first and second reading. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Andy Harris' (R-Md. 1st) loyalty to his constituents, Harris told Dorchester Chamber of Commerce members inside the Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay Golf Resort, Spa and Marina that his office is here to help them.\"We can make your business run easier,\" he said during his keynote speech for the chamber's 79th annual business meeting and dinner. \"We can work through the bureaucracy. Please get in touch with my office. We're more than happy to help you.\"\nEarlier that evening, protesters lined the sidewalks of U.S. Route 50 outside the Hyatt, calling on Harris to hold a town hall and questioning whether Harris' allegiance is to his constituents or to Elon Musk and the Trump administration. The rally was organized by Cambridge Indivisible, a chapter of a national organization that aims to elect progressive leaders.\nSpeaking to members of the media after the chamber dinner, Harris said he didn't believe many of the people at the rally were his constituents.\n\"They're brought in by buses,\" he said. \"I don't know where those buses come from. And we know that the national Indivisibles are involved. So we believe that a lot of those people aren't even constituents.\"\nHarris said he heard from a Washington, D.C., organization's leader \"who knows what's going on\" that people at the rally were getting paid to be there. He said he would not name who told him that.\n\"This is astroturf,\" he said. \"This is not grassroots.\"\nCambridge Indivisible Founder and Chair Michelle Fowle said many of those at the rally were her neighbors who live in Cambridge.\n\"He's just a liar,\" she said about Harris.\nHarris said he will be holding a virtual town hall on March 25 so he can communicate with constituents from all over his district.\n\"If these protesters want to call in, if they want to get on my town hall, I will answer that question on my town hall,\" he said. \"But I'm not going to hold a town hall for 100 people when I could hold a town hall and reach out to 5,000 people who don't have to leave their homes, get bused in by some entity paying for that bus.\"\nHarris said he is \"laser focused\" on working for his constituents and advancing the Trump administration's agenda.\n\"Who also won the district with high numbers,\" he said about President Donald Trump (R) getting elected in November.\nIn Dorchester County, Trump won 55.99% of the vote, according to the Maryland State Board of Elections.\nDuring the rally before the chamber dinner, protesters brought up concerns with recent mass firings of federal workers. Suzanne Sullivan said she has concerns about what the firings will do for the local economy. Sullivan, who lives in Dorchester County, is the wife of environmental scientist Jake Shaner, who was recently fired from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nHarris told media after the dinner that most companies layoff employees every three to five years. He said that with federal tax cuts, the federal government will grow the economy so there are \"plenty of jobs for every American.\"\n\"Look, do I feel for everybody who's laid off?\" he asked. \"Absolutely. Private industry, public government. It's a personal family setback. That's exactly why we have unemployment insurance and we have the social net until these individuals find another job.\"\nHARRIS' KEYNOTE SPEECH\nDuring his keynote speech, Harris touched on a number of issues relevant to Dorchester County and the Eastern Shore. He spoke about the importance of the agriculture industry, low-cost energy and the H-2B visa program.\nHarris also brought up the need for blue catfish processing centers to help reduce the population of the invasive species in the Chesapeake Bay. He said federal funding will be available to entrepreneurs who want to build processing plants so the catfish can be considered a commercially viable seafood product.\nHarris said two things the county should focus on are addressing drug and alcohol addiction and making sure every child is reading on grade level.\n\"And we can certainly provide help from the federal government,\" he said. \"But I'll tell you, some of the best solutions are at the local level.\"\nHarris, who lives in Cambridge, said it is a pleasure to represent the people of the Eastern Shore. He said he lives a \"blessed life\" where he can be at Mar-a-Lago one night and eating at Cindy's Kitchen in Cambridge the next morning.\n\"It's like the best of both worlds,\" he said. \"And to be honest with you, I like Cindy's better. But don't tell the president that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Angela Alsobrooks (D) met with multiple municipal leaders from across the Eastern Shore to discuss issues they face.In addition to meeting with multiple municipalities, Alsobrooks visited Eastern Shore agricultural leaders and participated in a tour of Chesapeake College. She met with higher education leaders during her stop at the college.\nAlsobrooks heard concerns of municipal officials including the freezing and cutting of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds and how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on the Eastern Shore can affect the agricultural economy and area families.\n\"It's so important today to be here and to have conversations,\" Alsobrooks said. \"We spent the day here very intentionally to hear from farmers, to hear from business owners, to hear from municipal leaders, who are primarily sharing the impact of some of the federal cuts that we've seen and that we've seen in some of the freezing of funds.\"\nMultiple municipalities voiced their concerns about the freezing and cuts of federal funding. One big project on the Eastern Shore is the Ocean City beach replenishment project.\nAccording to Ocean City officials, the beach replenishment project was first started in 1989 and is a partnership between the federal government, the state of Maryland, Worcester County and Ocean City.\nThe project was built to protect the shoreline along the Ocean City coastline. It consists of building a dune system, a seawall and pumping sand on the beach to provide protection from storms.\nThe project has estimated to save $1 billion in property damage since its completion in 1991. Every year in the winter, Ocean City conducts the project, but the federal funding for this winter project has not been received.\nAnother concern brought to Alsobrooks was the funding freeze for the Shore Resiliency program by FEMA.\nAccording to Cambridge officials, the plan for the project includes three main elements: a living shoreline, earth and rock embankments and stormwater management to alleviate flooding.\nAlmost 30% of the design for the Cambridge program is done, but the funds for that project has been frozen.\nAnother concern brought to Alsobrooks was helping kids who experience immigrant enforcement with their parents and how immigrant enforcement will effect the economy on the Eastern Shore.\nSalisbury officials mentioned two men on work visas with families who were picked up by ICE and that have already been shipped to New Orleans. The officials are concerned about how the agricultural economy can be affected.\nAnother story mentioned was about two daughters a 5- and 7-year-old whose parents were picked up by ICE. The children lived at home for two days without mentioning anything to school officials.\nAlsobrooks listened to all concerns and what what she plans to do and how important their concerns are to the state.\n\"I'm going to be working to make sure that I really do what I can to to get those funds unfrozen and to continue to stay in communication with leaders and community of members to help our state be successful,\" she said.\nOfficials voiced appreciation for Alsobrooks listening and her promise to continue to communicate with leaders on the Eastern Shore.\n\"It's really important that the senator hears from small communities here in the Eastern Shore,\" said Easton Mayor Megan Cook. \"It feels like she's really taking our concerns seriously into heart, and she's going to find the answers to our questions.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County conduct first FY26 budget workshop\n\n March 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 635\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Caroline County Commissioners, Deputy Administrator Daniel Fox and grant coordinator Stacy Seward, who helps with the budget annually, tackled the first workshop for fiscal year 2026 budget at the county commissioners meeting on Tuesday.While the budget is a work in progress, Caroline County Commissioner President Travis Breeding cautioned that the work done at Tuesday's meeting is fluid and could be changed as discussions continue.\n\"I should point out that a lot of this is fluid and still up in the air,\" Breeding said, adding that the pending state budget could change things. \"We still don't have a clear picture of what kind of fiscal situation were going to be in when they strike the budget.\"\nThe county is expected to bring in $77 million in revenue, while the proposed fiscal year expenditures are currently $79 million, leaving a $2 million shortfall.\nFor capital funding the county has $7.3 million allocated for capital funding. The requested amount for capital funding in FY26 is $10.4 million, leaving a shortfall of $3.1 million.\nBoth budgets need to be in balance when they are presented at a public hearing in May.\nThe commissioners discussed both the operating and capital budgets to account for the shortfalls in both budgets.\nCAPITAL BUDGET\nA number of items were discussed in the capital budget.\nThe Department of Corrections control panel for $120,00 is already being worked on but the requested new van is still in question. While the van is damaged the county took into account the mileage on the van is only 22,330.\n\"I think we should get the van looked at and evaluated,\" County Commissioner Frank Bartz said.\nThe Department of Emergency Services could receive funding for the 14 cardiac monitor replacement, but the commissioners discussed waiting one more year for purchasing a number of requested trucks.\nFacilities requested a long list of items which the county commissioners discussed to fund the first seven and will discuss the rest as the budget workshop sessions continue.\nThe county commissioners discussed potentially cutting capital funds for these organizations.\nAll Circuit Court request for $272,000.DES $180,000 for EMS lieutenant and EMS division chief.Facilities proposal to receive $498,000 of requested $1,477,000.All Public Works requests except a six-wheel dump truck and a Husqvarna Zero Turn mower for $1,203,500.All Rec and Parks requests except a Skag 72-inch Zero Turn mower for $136,000All 4-H Park requests for $90,000.All Human Society requests for $85,000.\nOPERATING BUDGET\nWhile the operating budget has a $2 million deficit, the county must find cuts in many different areas. Companies in the expenditure category gave the commissioners the most discussion at the county commissioners' first workshop.\n\"I appreciate everything these volunteers organizations do,\" County Commissioners President Travis Breeding said. \"There is a lot of other volunteers organizations and nonprofits in the county that we don't give money to, our job is public safety. My position is the same as its been the last two years, I don't think we should fund any of them.\"\nWhile Breeding thinks they could potentially save funding here, Commissioners Porter and Bartz said that some nonprofits should be allocated some funds.\n\"I looked at some of the budgets to see whether the $5,000 will impact their budgets or not, some I thought I felt we could contribute to, some I struck off,\" Bartz said.\nThe commissioners also discussed the fire companies that requested a 10% increase in allocation, and a property tax credit. Breeding landed on a 5% increase, Porter at 10% and Bartz at 7.5%.\n\"Enter our different numbers I don't think we will come to a consensus today, we have one more public hearing,\" Breeding said.\nThe commissioners will discuss more requests. Here are the numbers for the potential expenditure category:\nExpenditure Category: Breeding allocated $6,300 for non-profit organizations.Porter allocated $5,000 to Positive striders.Bartz allocated money to all nonprofit organizations.Porter gave $50,000 for a property tax credit, Bartz and Breeding $0.All commissioners have different numbers for allocations. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bramble Inc. with a $447,150 contract to resurface three miles of roads at various locations in the city. City Manager Glenn Steckman said the contract was approved before city staff was made aware that if the city paves through intersections that are not up to standard with Americans with Disabilities Act, it has to update those intersections.\n\"So to pave through the intersection, you have to improve the intersection,\" Steckman said.\nDuring the council meeting, Steckman told commissioners the city could either spend approximately $125,000 more to address the intersections as the city paves the three miles or reduce the scope of the project and pave less road in order to address the intersections with the money already budgeted in the contract.\nSteckman said the city is estimating intersection updates would cost about $6,000 per intersection. He recommended the council vote to spend additional money to complete the three miles of paving. He said the city had originally budgeted $600,000 for the project.\nBefore the council took a vote, commissioners asked questions about prioritizing certain streets and areas for paving.\nAccording to City Council documents, the city used a 2018 pavement condition study for the project to determine which streets are in most need of being repaved. Commissioner Brian Roche said it would be a waste of money to ignore the study.\n\"You have to be careful because we could end up having roads that fall further into disrepair just because someone thinks that their road is in worse shape when in fact an engineering analysis has determined where (is in worse shape),\" he said.\nAfter discussion, the council voted to increase the cost of the contract to include updates to the intersections without reducing the scope of the project. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Ridgely commissioners, residents weigh in on potential of reinstating police department\n\n March 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 769\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY — Over a year after suspending the now-defunct Ridgely Police Department, town commissioners say reestablishing the force will cost the town nearly double its projected payment to the county sheriff for police coverage.At a workshop Wednesday, Commissioner Brad Sears told residents that restoring the department would cost an estimated $852,000. Ridgely currently receives dedicated coverage from the Caroline County Sheriff's Office based on a memorandum of understanding. Renewing that MOU for fiscal year 2026 would cost $493,000, per estimates.\nA number of residents questioned the Town Council's openness to consider reinstating the department. Concerns raised stem back to the town's controversial decision to suspend and subsequently lay off the department last year amid a criminal investigation into the police chief that came up empty.\nResidents were only permitted to testify in front of the commissioners Wednesday if they had signed up around a day in advance.\nHeather Amador said the workshop felt like the town was \"checking a box.\"\n\"I feel solid that your minds are made up,\" Amador told commissioners. \"Some of you openly expressed that at the last town meeting. It feels pretty certain that my words and efforts will be for nothing.\"\n\"We're not going to make any decisions tonight,\" Sears said. \"We're not really going to take questions, because we want to focus on what you, the public, have to say. And we want to take some time to properly consider what you have to say.\"\nThe commissioners suspended former Police Chief Jeff Eckrich and the entire department March 12, 2024, amid a state criminal investigation into Eckrich due to \"suspected\" perjury and misconduct in office.\nOn July 25, 2024, an investigation report by the Office of the State Prosecutor found no \"sufficient evidence of criminal activity warranting further investigation or prosecution.\"\nBut by that time, the Ridgely officers had already been laid off with the start of the new fiscal year July 1. The town began selling and transferring its police vehicles and equipment in the weeks before the state prosecutor's report was released.\nSince then, Ridgely has maintained a contract with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office to have assigned officers covering the town. Last week, the Sheriff's Office announced a third officer was assigned to the Ridgely patrol group.\nAt Wednesday's meeting, Sears explained why Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker and Chief Deputy Rodney Helmer weren't in attendance.\n\"They wanted to attend, but they were advised by their attorney not to attend because there is potential litigation outstanding,\" Sears said. Lt. George Paugh attended in their place.\nWhile two residents submitted written testimony in support of maintaining Caroline County Sheriff's Office coverage, residents who spoke at the meeting largely asked for two other options: reinstating the town's force or ending the Sheriff's Office contract and operating like towns such as Goldsboro and Preston, which receive general county and state police patrol.\n\"Since the sheriff has taken over, we've had no community policing like before,\" said Christine Eckrich, wife of the former Ridgely chief. \"And a lot of the hours have not been covered. So now my question is, what are we paying for? Why are we double paying for the Sheriff's Office to come to Ridgely.\"\nResident Anna Mansfield questioned if the budget estimates for a reestablished town force and the county coverage are comparable.\n\"Was the Ridgely Police Department afforded the ability to reduce their hours to meet the amount of hours expected for the desired budget?\" Mansfield asked commissioners.\nSears, who assumed his seat in July 2024 after the department's suspension earlier that year, prepared the cost estimates by reviewing past police budgets, meeting with a consultant and comparing projections to other local departments.\nHe said it's key to have \"rationale and cost effective reasons\" when considering creating a police department.\nResident Jennifer Nesselroad stood up to express her displeasure.\n\"We had a police department, and we don't need to start a new one because you illegally took ours away,\" she said, leaving the room.\nPresident John Buckle said in an opening statement that \"the commissioners will listen carefully to what everyone has to say.\" Commissioner John Hurley provided no comment at the workshop.\nAs the meeting closed, Sears emphasized that reinstating the police department would require infrastructure and safety improvements to the department's office within the town hall building.\n\"But the police department existed how many years without those features,\" resident Robin Martin said.\n\"Things have changed a lot over the last five to 10 years,\" Sears responded. \"The racial incidents, the general degradation of respect for authority, COVID and so on has changed our cultural landscape. Violence is on the upswing.\"\n\"It's very difficult to be a police officer,\" he later added. \"It's very difficult to attract and retain police officers.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It will be awarded to Marshall's Professional Property Management out of Cambridge.\nThe company will perform maintenance on properties as directed by code officials, such as unkempt yards, grass cutting and brush and debris removal.\n\"Last year, unfortunately, we did not have a contract with anybody,\" Diem said Tuesday. \"It kind of fell through the cracks under the previous management. We're trying to rectify that situation.\"\nDiem added that the decision to go with Marshall's Professional Property Management was based on performance and reliability, not price.\n\"We've had others in the past that the response was slow or nonexistent,\" Diem said. \"And then the billing was slow, which, in turn, leads to slow effort on the town to get those invoices out.\"\nOf the three bids not chosen, Diem wrote to the council that two raised responsibility and responsiveness concerns despite cheaper rates. The third came from S&B Landscaping, which will serve as code enforcement's backup contractor if additional support is needed.\nThe council unanimously approved Diem's request.\n\"I have had personal experience with them in my previous career, and they've been outstanding,\" Ward 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry said of Marshall's. \"So I'm all in.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Harris hears constituent concerns during telephone town hall\n\n March 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 597\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After rallies in the last month called on Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) to hold an in-person town hall, Harris opened a channel of communication with constituents Tuesday evening to answer questions and hear concerns.The telephone town hall was attended by more than 10,000 people, Harris said. He said the reason he likes doing telephone town halls rather than in-person town halls is because more people are able to attend without having to leave their homes.\n\"Far many more (people) than we could ever do in any other venue,\" Harris said.\nDuring the hour-long telephone town hall, Harris heard from around 15 people. Those who called in only gave their first names, with some sharing where they live.\nMany concerns and questions raised during the town hall dealt with recent federal layoffs, the fate of programs like Social Security and Medicaid, recent actions taken by the Trump administration and Harris' voting history. Some of the people who spoke shared their criticisms of Harris.\nOne caller, identified as James, shared concerns about the recent announcements of funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health. He said \"fundamental\" NIH discoveries fuel the pharmaceutical industry and without the funds to make those discoveries, the pharmaceutical industry will \"collapse.\"\n\"Trump has sent his idiots from the Department of Governmental Elimination into our fundamental medical research,\" James said, referencing the Department of Government Efficiency. \"And this will destroy the fundamental formation of discovering drugs in this country. So, Congressman Harris, wake up.\"\nAfter sharing he thinks Elon Musk — who heads the Department of Government Efficiency — shouldn't be called an idiot, Harris said the Trump administration wants to reduce overhead costs, which he believes would allow the federal government to spend more money on research.\nHarris, a former physician who was an NIH-funded researcher, said institutions who receive a research grant can get as much as 80% in additional funding for overhead. He said there should be a cap on that overhead funding.\n\"To me, that's taking advantage of the federal government,\" he said. \"And if we can cap the overhead, it allows us to actually spend more money on actual research projects, not on administrative costs.\"\nAnother caller, identified as Allison from Wicomico County, asked what Harris is doing to protect his constituents' data that may have been accessed by the Department of Government Efficiency.\nAllison brought up the recent rally Cambridge Indivisible held in Cambridge to demand he hold a town hall. She said Harris \"blatantly lied\" that the protesters at the rally were bused in and not his constituents.\nAs she continued to talk about how she knew many of the people at the rally, Harris tried to speak. As Allison continued speaking, Harris said he was sorry, but he would have to mute her.\n\"Look, if you're going to filibuster, I have to cut you off,\" he said before muting her.\nHarris then said there was a bus, funded by Indivisible, going to Cambridge, adding \"there's no question in anyone's mind\" about that.\nCambridge Indivisible Co-Founder and Co-Chair Michelle Fowle has said many of those at the rally were her neighbors who live in Cambridge.\nIn response to Allison's question about personal data, Harris said there are multiple government organizations, like the IRS, that have access to citizens' personal data. He said the Department of Government Efficiency has accessed people's birth dates to identify \"fraud, waste and abuse.\"\n\"I would hope that everybody wants waste, fraud and abuse uncovered,\" he said.\nHarris instructed those that he wasn't able to hear from during the event to stay on the line after so their question could be recorded and his office could get back to them. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said that came after \"significant vandalism\" of a number of his other signs.\n\"This act of hate has escalated the situation into a deeply troubling reality that demands our collective attention,\" Gunsallus wrote.\nDon Abbatiello, the current Ward 2 representative running against Gunsallus for the presidential seat, said theft and vandalism do not belong in the town's elections.\nIn an interview Friday, Abbatiello said he informed Gunsallus of the defaced sign after discovering it while campaigning in town Wednesday.\n\"We obviously disagree on some issues, we're running against each other, but there's no reason to deface people's property,\" Abbatiello said. \"There's no reason to bring hatred into this at all. We are still a community. We're still neighbors. We should act like it.\"\nGunsallus contacted the Easton Police Department after seeing the South Aurora Street sign. He also says campaign signs have been stolen from his home.\nAbbatiello says a few of his signs have gone missing as well, though he's unsure if they were stolen or blew away due to wind.\nInterim Town Manager Alan Lowrey, Easton's police chief, said an investigation into the defaced sign on South Aurora Street is underway. Lowrey told The Star Democrat that as for missing signs, some were taken down by town code enforcers due to violating town code.\nPolitical sign violations include too many signs on one property or signs placed in a public right-of-way, Lowrey said. To avoid confusion moving forward, Lowrey has asked code enforcement to notify him of any signs not within the code so he can contact the candidate.\nLowrey says he's reached out to both Abbatiello and Gunsallus regarding signs that need to be moved or removed due to town code. Both candidates have complied, Lowrey noted.\nGunsallus and Abbatiello each denounced sign vandalism and acts of hatred.\n\"These types of things shouldn't happen during a campaign,\" Gunsallus wrote in a statement to The Star Democrat. \"However, I'm hopeful this can be a turning point for our town to come together, reject hate, and foster love in its place.\"\n\"We're a community, we all live here together,\" Abbatiello said. \"We need to get along with one another. And bringing in things like that, totally uncalled for.\"\nEaston Police Department Sgt. Patrick Sally says stealing or defacing political signs are criminal offenses. He emphasized that many homeowners and businesses have security technology, such as Ring cameras, that can help identify those stealing or defacing signs.\n\"You're going to pay the price if you're caught,\" Sally said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton Farmers Market retains downtown spot for 2025\n\n March 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 540\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Easton Farmers Market is set to remain at its normal downtown spot this season, though the location drew concerns at a recent town meeting.The market's public assembly permit was approved by the Easton Town Council March 18, allowing the market — operated by the Avalon Foundation — to run Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on North Harrison Street behind Goodwill in the town's parking Lot 5.\nBut some business owners expressed worry about the farmers market limiting downtown parking on Saturday mornings.\nSteve Mangasarian, owner of Breakfast in Easton, said at the March 18 Town Council meeting that there have been parking and trash disposal issues stemming from the farmers market.\nIn an interview, Mangasarian said while he's not against the market and acknowledged it has \"many good actors,\" he believes the Avalon is not doing enough to police market vendors.\n\"We feel as if we have a right as taxpayers to be entitled to some parking spaces, to be entitled to the secure use of our dumpsters, and accessibility to our parking lot,\" Mangasarian said. \"And nobody at the farmers market seems to worry about these merchants who are being negatively impacted by the market.\"\nMarie Nuthall, the Avalon's outdoor event coordinator , argued the downtown location is crucial for community connection. The market has been in the same spot for more than 30 years, Nuthall said.\n\"Over that time, families get to know where to find us, generations, their kids, so forth,\" she said. \"Longevity and consistency is very, very important to us.\"\n\"The town has a vested interest in the farmers market being there, because we are part of a tourism draw,\" she added.\nNuthall said vendors sign memorandums of understanding at the beginning of each season outlining proper garbage disposal standards and parking regulations.\n\"We do everything that we can to be really good neighbors to all the neighboring businesses,\" Nuthall said.\nThe public assembly permit first went through the Easton Police Department before it hit the Town Council desk. While the Easton Police Department recommended approval for the North Harrison Street location, it also suggested an alternative spot at the District Court parking lot on Dover Street.\nThat lot is larger and would prevent downtown parking from being unavailable on Saturday mornings, according to EPD recommendations.\nEaston Sgt. Patrick Sally said while the Harrison Street setup is \"as safe as it ever has been,\" the department explored another option because an unofficial parking lot on Washington Street at the site of the former Safeway is soon to be under construction.\nIn an interview, Sally said the district court lot may be more of a \"long-term\" consideration. \"It is a safety concern because there (are) a lot of people that do walk there,\" Sally said of the current downtown location.\nCrossing guards are typically stationed at the current location during peak hours to assist pedestrian traffic on Harrison Street and Brewers Lane.\nNuthall said it's a relief to have the market remain in Lot 5 this year. She said \"if a move is inevitable\" in the future, she hopes the market and vendors \"have buy-in\" during that decision-making process.\n\"It should be something that is done thoughtfully and collaboratively,\" Nuthall said.\nThe Easton Farmers Market kicks off its 2025 season Saturday, April 12, and runs through December. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Planning Commission sends DAF legislation to County Council\n\n April 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 380\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot County Council will soon be considering new restrictions on the storage of food processing residuals.Wednesday, the Talbot County Planning Commission unanimously voted to send a piece of legislation up to the council, deeming it consistent with the county's comprehensive plan.\nThe legislation aims to help Talbot County fall in line with neighboring counties on restricting the residuals, which are animal waste from food processing that are often applied to farmland as fertilizer.\nUnder state law, the residuals cannot be applied to land between Dec. 15 and March 1, requiring them to be stored during the winter months.\nLast year, Caroline County restricted storage of food processing residuals, often referred to as dissolved air flotation, or DAF, residuals. It came amid significant resident complaints of the noxious odors and bugs that stemmed from farming operations keeping the product in open storage tanks.\nTalbot's legislation would ban open-top storage of DAF or food processing residuals. Closed-top storage would be permitted provided it follows the following conditions, among others:\nThe storage applicant receives site plan approval from the county.The applicant has an approved nutrient management plan from the state.The applicant has at least a 500-foot setback from residential properties, or at least a 200-foot setback if all affected property owners consent.The applicant applies the materials on the same property where they are being stored.The applicant stores and applies the materials in a permitted zoning district.\nThe legislation would not ban storage of food processing residuals in a temporary storage unit — such as a \"mobile, closed container\" — near where they are being applied. Such temporary storage would be capped at 90 days.\nBefore the commission approved the legislation, the body set forth a few minor conditions to be amended.\n\"The one thing that we do want to make sure is that we exempt food processing residuals that are used for livestock feed,\" commission member Chip Councell said.\nBryce Yelton, assistant planning officer, said that would be an easy amendment to make, simply by adjusting the definition for food processing residuals in the legislation.\nCouncell added that the county discussed the DAF legislation with the Talbot County Farm Bureau last August. The farm bureau was supportive, he said.\nWhile the commission is recommending approval to the County Council, the bill will still require a council vote to be enacted. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County Police Accountability Board reports decrease in misconduct complaints\n\n April 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 416\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot County's Police Accountability Board investigated just six resident complaints of police misconduct in 2024, down from 15 complaints in 2023.Mitch Ettinger, chairman of the board, reported these statistics to the Talbot County Council Tuesday. He said the decrease in complaints is \"a testament to the fantastic law enforcement agencies\" in the county.\nComplaints have ticked up since January. In the first quarter of 2025, the charging committee has received seven complaints of police misconduct, Ettinger noted. An explanation for the uptick was not provided at the meeting.\nOf the six complaints last year, four were dismissed and two resulted in administrative charges against an officer.\nAccording to the board's 2024 report, the decrease is due, in part, to a resident moving out of the county who submitted many complaints in 2023.\nWith fewer complaints to investigate, PAB members became interested in how they might otherwise serve the county, Ettinger said.\nTuesday, Ettinger noted all police misconduct complaints in the last two years have been made directly to law enforcement agencies and subsequently referred to the charging committee. Ettinger said residents may not be aware that complaints can be made directly to the accountability board as well.\nHe asked council members for feedback on whether the board is meeting expectations and on potentially expanding the role of the PAB.\n\"Our mandate is narrow by statute,\" Ettinger said, \"but we have seen in other jurisdictions, PABs go well beyond that mandate at the direction of their council, including to review policies of law enforcement agencies.\"\n\"The PAB feels that its role is not all that substantive,\" he added.\nPolice accountability boards were mandated statewide by Maryland's Police Accountability Act of 2021. PABs, made up of everyday residents, are responsible for meeting with law enforcement agencies, fielding complaints of police misconduct, reviewing use of force reports and submitting annual reports to county officials.\nAll counties have an administrative charging committee that sits under the PAB. Those committees determine if an officer will be administratively charged and, if so, what discipline they receive.\nCounty Council Vice President Pete Lesher said he hopes for the county to \"look at other models and see what might be working in other jurisdictions.\"\nCouncil member Keasha Haythe said it is important for the county to consider both looking at other jurisdictions and increasing resident awareness of the PAB complaint process.\nMeanwhile, council member Dave Stepp said he is comfortable with the board's responsibilities remaining the same.\n\"I see no reason to expand the scope or functionality other than what's required by law,\" Stepp said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I got interested in politics when I was involved with Medical Freedom for Talbot County.\n1. Why are you running for the Ward 2 seat on the Easton Town Council?\nRunning for Ward 2 is an honor. I am running because we need a voice for the day-to-day people who live in Easton. The hardworking backbone of our society. Your neighbors, servers, police, grocery store workers, those struggling on social security, etc. I see and hear the struggles.\n2. What issues will you prioritize if elected?\nI will prioritize the accountability of the Town Council, transparency and accountability with \"your\" money, smart growth for our special town.\nWe need to keep our next generation. People with and without children are from moving away from the Shore because they can't afford to live here and raise a family.\n3. What changes would you make to the town's budget, and what budget items should not be cut?\nThe town budget is not transparent enough. We need to see more details instead of just line items with no explanations. It's hard to see exactly where our money is going.\n4. While the town has grown, affordable housing remains a challenge for residents. How should the town build more housing, in particular affordable housing?\nIt is funny the Census has Easton population growth of only 101 more people since 2020. We all can see there has been much more growth. Either that or are we just congested because of workers commuting who live in more affordable towns.We need starter home neighborhoods for the first responders, teachers and people not making six figures. We can think outside the box — barndominiums, tiny homes or prefab housing neighborhoods, which are much less expensive to build.\n5. What are your plans for public safety in Easton? What can be improved?\nSafety is key for everyone in Easton. We need to treat our neighbors with kindness. Introduce yourself and watch out for each other. We have exceptional first responders, including police, EMS and volunteer firefighters, working a tough job just out of their heart for the people of their community. They are doing a great job even though they are running with short manpower.\nWith the area growing, we need to make sure we keep them equipped with proper needs.\n6. In addition to serving the Town of Easton as a whole, what are your plans to improve your ward specifically?\nI love the Ward 2 area where I live and volunteer. The Rails to Trails is a huge part of linking neighborhoods to the downtown area. Keeping that a positive and safe trail is always a concern for everyone.\nAlso, Idlewild Park is the most used park in Easton, so we need to keep it updated for everyone. The play area needs some attention, and why not do a pickleball court, since its popularity has grown 52% since 2019?\nThe Star Democrat questionnaire was sent to all Easton Town Council candidates to allow them to share their perspective on various town issues in their own words.

Why are you running for Easton Town Council president?\nI'm running for council president because elections should be about options, not just be a coronation. It's important to offer voters a choice.\nI want to bring a collaborative, consensus-building leadership style to the council and to be a leader who listens. Good leadership is about teamwork — no matter how strong your ideas are, they won't move forward without support from your fellow council members. I believe I can lead with respect and cooperation to help guide thoughtful decisions that reflect the needs of our residents.\n2. What issues will you prioritize if elected?\nMy priorities are smart development, public safety and fiscal responsibility. Easton is growing fast, and we need to manage that growth and avoid unnecessary development.\nI support limiting annexation until we ensure infrastructure can support our current development. For large redevelopment projects, the Town Council needs to be included in the decision making.\nI'll prioritize support for our police and fire departments — funding, staffing and equipment must be maintained to support first-class service. Health care access is another major concern. I want to work with medical partners to attract more doctors.\nI will ensure we continue balanced budgets, prioritizing services residents rely on without wasting taxpayers' money.\n3. While the town has grown, affordable housing remains a challenge for residents. How should the town build more housing, in particular affordable housing?\nThere's no one-size-fits-all solution to affordable housing, but we must be proactive. I'd work closely with partners like the Affordable Housing Board and Habitat for Humanity to explore opportunities for creating starter homes. Zoning tools, incentives for developers and creative use of town-owned properties could also play a role. We need to support a mix of housing types to serve working families, young professionals and seniors. It's important to balance affordability with quality in the community.\n4. The town has seen increased development in its downtown core as well as on Route 50. How should the town prepare for the impacts of such growth?\nTo prepare for Easton's growth, we need a strong, forward-thinking plan that addresses traffic, infrastructure and public services. New development should not outpace our ability to support it. Council members must be actively involved in major project decisions, particularly those with large impacts. Developers should be responsible for mitigating traffic and parking issues their projects may cause. Infrastructure improvements should be timed with development, not after. Transparency, community input and smart land-use policies are key to guiding growth in a way that keeps Easton a livable, vibrant town and preserves our way of life.\n5. What are your plans for public safety in Easton? What can be improved?\nStrong public safety services are essential to maintaining Easton as a safe and welcoming place for families, businesses and visitors.\nI support increasing the presence of police on the rail trails, in parks and at community events to ensure safety and visibility. I support expanding our public camera system to deter crime and aid investigations. Our police need competitive benefits, including improved pensions, to attract and retain top talent.\nOur volunteer fire department needs to be supported with the best equipment. I'm incredibly proud of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department's regional training campus that will better prepare our emergency responders and reduce training costs.\n6. What have you accomplished during your time on the council thus far? How will you seek to continue those efforts?\nDuring my time on the council, I've supported initiatives that improve quality of life and promote responsible government. I've worked to expand walkability, including sidewalk and crosswalk improvements. I've brought new playgrounds and improved old ones in my ward. We've passed balanced budgets every year without raising the property tax rate. I helped implement the take-home car program for Easton Police, an important recruitment and retention tool. I've focused on community-based policies that are practical and sustainable.\nThe Star Democrat questionnaire was sent to all Easton Town Council candidates to allow them to share their perspective on various town issues in their own words.

Interdisciplinary in Computer Science and Natural Science\nOccupation: Installation Tech at Ustreamwifi LLC\nPrevious political experience: None\n1. Why are you running for the Ward 4 seat on the Easton Town Council?\nI love Easton. One day I hope to have a family here, and I want to ensure Easton stays safe and livable (not just survivable) for future families and its current population. It's also very important for young people to step up and get involved in our civil government and approach things with a new perspective and fresh ideas.\n2. What issues will you prioritize if elected?\nFour points: Financial transparency and responsibility, public safety and stronger communities, smart growth and local business support, and infrastructure and quality of life.\n3. What changes would you make to the town's budget, and what budget items should not be cut?\nThere is a lot of prospective future growth in Easton. We have to make sure the police are well funded. On top of that, the unnecessary fees for businesses need to be cut back, and the process needs to be streamlined. That's just the tip of the iceberg.\n4. While the town has grown, affordable housing remains a challenge for residents. How should the town build more housing, in particular affordable housing?\nAffordable housing in not necessarily the answer. I want to take a stand that more starter homes be developed in Easton so young families (and old) can afford to live here.\n5. What are your plans for public safety in Easton? What can be improved?\nI'm pretty sure I addressed this earlier, but to expound: our police department is at least 5 people understaffed. That should never be the case. Increasing their funding while cutting ridiculous and unnecessary items would be the first item on the agenda (some might say that the town will then have less money to use elsewhere, but that just means they need to be more responsible with how they spend taxpayer dollars).\n6. In addition to serving the Town of Easton as a whole, what are your plans to improve your ward specifically?\nI want to (above all else) listen to my ward. I want to be easily accessible, open minded to concerns and committed to doing what is right by them. I have been given a back to shoulder burdens, not to turn it on the people I am representing.\nThe Star Democrat questionnaire was sent to all Easton Town Council candidates to allow them to share their perspective on various town issues in their own words.

I would prioritize increasing funding for our first responders, ensuring they have the resources to serve and protect us effectively. Their safety and well-being directly impact our community's security. As for budget cuts, this year's proposal leaves little room for reductions without compromising essential services. However, I would carefully review discretionary spending to identify any inefficiencies or non-essential items that could be trimmed, allowing the Town Council to reallocate those funds to critical areas that enhance public safety and community well-being.\n4. While the town has grown, affordable housing remains a challenge for residents. How should the town build more housing, in particular affordable housing?\nTo address the challenge of affordable housing in Easton, the town should consider purchasing land designated for this purpose. Partnering with organizations like Habitat for Humanity can be an effective strategy to develop affordable housing options. Collaborating with such organizations allows us to leverage their expertise and resources, ensuring homes are built efficiently and sustainably. These proactive steps can create more inclusive housing opportunities, ensuring all residents can access safe and affordable homes in Easton.\n5. What are your plans for public safety in Easton? What can be improved?\nMy plans for enhancing public safety in Easton focus on proactive community engagement and support for our police department. I believe in the importance of transportation safety initiatives and continued proactive neighborhood patrols to foster a sense of security. While recruitment efforts have improved, we must prioritize officer retention by developing a suitable retirement plan that benefits current officers and those nearing retirement. This will ensure younger officers gain valuable experience before advancing to command staff positions. Investing in our officers and fostering community relationships can create a safer, more resilient Easton for everyone.\n6. In addition to serving the Town of Easton as a whole, what are your plans to improve your ward specifically?\nTo improve Ward 4 specifically, I will focus on fostering a strong sense of community through partnership, respect, integrity, dedication and empowerment. By actively engaging with residents, I aim to understand their needs and aspirations, ensuring that our initiatives reflect our shared values. Together, we can address local concerns, enhance public spaces and promote community events that strengthen our bonds. I invite the constituents of Ward 4 to join me on this journey, working hand in hand to build a vibrant and inclusive community that not only uplifts our ward but also contributes to the overall progress of Easton.\nThe Star Democrat questionnaire was sent to all Easton Town Council candidates to allow them to share their perspective on various town issues in their own words. Responses may be edited for length and clarity. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Easton Planning Commission approves Zaxbys on Route 50\n\n April 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 493\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Easton Planning Commission approved a plan to build a Zaxbys restaurant on Route 50 Thursday.Developers for the restaurant largely quelled concerns expressed last month when commission members tabled architectural approval. Those concerns centered on the bright red and blue colors in design renderings.\nThursday, franchise co-owner and Delmarva Real Estate Management Group attorney Curtis Snyder presented colored renderings of an updated design, which includes additional brick around the 2,000-square-foot building. The new renderings were less \"cartoonish\" in color and more accurately reflect what the building will look like, Snyder said.\nMost commission members felt the updated design was an improvement.\n\"There are some existing businesses that have blues that are much brighter than this,\" commission member Laurie Forster said. \"… I don't think it's unacceptable, and I do think it could be a great addition to the restaurant scene.\"\nThe Georgia-based franchise has hundreds of restaurants nationwide and is known for its chicken fingers, wings and signature sauces.\nCommission member Tom Klein said the Easton Zaxbys will bring jobs to town and serve as an upgrade to the \"eyesore\" that is the empty Wendy's building.\n\"If this went down in flames, I don't know how long it would be before something else came along,\" Klein said. \"So it could be sitting for quite some time like a lot of other empty lots on 50.\"\nSnyder said the Zaxbys building will be smaller than the former Wendy's, allowing for two drive-thru lanes that can accommodate 26 cars at once. \"We're confident in getting people in and out,\" Snyder said in response to a question of whether lines may spill onto the highway.\nPUSHBACK\nDuring Thursday's meeting, member Victoria McAndrews criticized the design, saying it's \"very garish\" compared to other Zaxbys restaurants in the country.\n\"I'm just not looking at this as an improvement over what was not satisfactory to begin with,\" McAndrews said.\nSnyder said corporate isn't willing to budge on the blue and red colors, part of the company's branding efforts.\nMcAndrews said the commission is not doing its job by accepting designs pushed down from the corporate level.\n\"That's in direct conflict with what the (comprehensive) plan says for Easton that we're supposed to strive for, which is not making it look like Anywhere, USA,\" she said.\n\"I'm still getting blowback from corporate over this design,\" Snyder responded. \"They do not want this brick on their building. … This is an extreme deviation in their mind.\"\nFollowing Forster and Klein's comments, commission Chair Philip Toussaint and member William Ryall indicated their satisfaction with the updated Zaxbys application. Ryall made the motion for approval, and McAndrews joined the rest of the commission in voting yes despite her concerns.\n\"I think it's an improvement,\" Ryall said. \"It's not perfect, but nothing ever is.\"\nThe Easton Zaxbys is one of three locations developers are pursuing as part of the restaurant's Maryland debut, with the others in Cambridge and Berlin.\nThe Easton location is projected to open in late 2025 or early 2026, Snyder told The Star Democrat last month. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton election: Gunsallus, Abbatiello weigh in on housing, growth and more\n\n April 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 749\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Town Council president candidates Frank Gunsallus and Don Abbatiello both recognize the need to monitor and manage Easton's growth, but they each indicated different strategies on how to do so in editorial board interviews with The Star Democrat this week.Gunsallus, the incumbent, is being challenged by Abbatiello, the current Ward 2 councilmember. Voters head to the polls May 6 to decide the council's next leader, as well as representatives for the second and fourth wards.\nDuring the interviews, both candidates were asked how to tackle Easton's affordable housing issue.\nGunsallus noted one of his priorities is to vote down an inclusionary zoning ordinance town leaders have expressed mixed opinions on. Instead, he said methods like removing impact fees or marking down land should be considered.\n\"It's a lot simpler than it's being made out to be,\" Gunsallus said. \"Those are very straightforward, simple ways that can be done very soon to make that happen.\"\nAbbatiello said the main issue with the lack of affordable homes is the rising price of land. He said incentivizing developers to build \"middle housing\" options is a solution.\n\"How do you get that price of land out of the equation? You have townhouses,\" Abbatiello said. \"And townhouses become your starter home for people.\"\nThe current Ward 2 representative added that his vote against the Gannon Range project on Matthewstown Road in 2022 stemmed from the high prices of those homes.\n\"It was bringing us $450,000, $500,000 homes, which is not something that we needed,\" he said.\nGunsallus pointed out he's asked for the Town Council to have more say in approving housing projects. At a February workshop, Gunsallus and others led a discussion of how the council has only approved 37% of the town's 1,000 housing units in the pipeline at the time.\nENVISIONING THE FUTURE\nThe town is in the early process of revising its comprehensive plan for the first time in 15 years. The Planning Commission is currently reviewing drafts of the new plan, which lays out a vision for how the town should prioritize its growth.\nAbbatiello said that in 2010, Easton was aiming to draw developers into town, but now the focus has changed.\n\"Tap the brakes, we need to slow down,\" he said of the current thought process.\nThe town's current comprehensive plan calls for 1% year-to-year growth. Gunsallus says he's \"of the school of thought that that 1% is the ceiling, and we should not be exceeding that.\"\n\"When I graduated high school here in 2006, the town was literally half the size population-wise that it is now,\" he said. \"So if we continue that same rate of growth, in 20 years, we'll have almost 40,000 people here.\"\nREPRESENTING RESIDENTS\nCandidates were asked questions concerning constituent representation. Gunsallus said he's given underrepresented groups a voice since being elected, such as when he voted to remove a 10-cent paper bag fee, a measure that narrowly fell short.\n\"That stemmed directly from a conversation with a room full of people about, 'I count my pennies when I go shopping so I can buy bags because my food stamps don't cover the cost of bags,'\" Gunsallus said.\nAbbatiello said if elected, he would push for each ward to have quarterly meetings. He said follow-up is critical, such as when he helped Ward 2 residents who raised concerns about safely walking to Walmart and Giant.\n\"I was annoying in saying, 'There needs to be a sidewalk on Elliott Road,'\" Abbatiello said.\nLEADERSHIP\nWith an election cycle that's become increasingly heated, both candidates offered thoughts on the responsibility of the council president and the disagreements that come with serving on the council.\n\"You can be the most amazing council president in the world, but if you can't get there with the rest of the council members, then you're going to lose every single vote that comes up,\" Abbatiello said.\n\"Sometimes you are not even part of the issue, but you still have to mediate or at least navigate the conversation,\" Gunsallus said. \" ... Let's find common ground and go from there.\"\nGunsallus said it's been an honor to serve in the role since 2023.\n\"I'm happy with what has occurred under my administration, and I am looking forward to continuing the good work for another four years,\" Gunsallus said.\nAbbatiello acknowledged serving on the council isn't an easy job, but he said it's an enjoyable one.\n\"You wonder if you're making the right decision,\" Abbatiello said. \"But at the same time, I am still glad that over the last six years I've had the opportunity to make those decisions. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Easton Town Council candidates make their cases at town hall\n\n April 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 756\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — With the election less than a week away, voters had the chance Tuesday to ask Town Council candidates a number of questions about issues facing Easton, including fiscal responsibility and housing.During a town hall hosted by The Talbot Spy and the Avalon Foundation Tuesday night, all seven candidates for three spots on the council made their pitches to voters.\nFor the council president seat, incumbent Frank Gunsallus and current Ward 2 representative Don Abbatiello will square off.\nWith Abbatiello opting to run for president, a new resident will assume the Ward 2 seat. In that race, Lynnette Keefe and Robert Rankin will face off.\nThe Ward 4 race will present voters with three options: incumbent the Rev. Elmer Davis, who has served in the seat since 2020; Moonyene Jackson-Amis, previously Ward 4's representative from 2001 to 2008; and newcomer Cameron Keefe.\nGunsallus and Abbatiello, along with other candidates, spoke about the town's budgetary outlook. The town's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 is $28 million and includes a real property tax rate of 52 cents per $100 of assessed value. That mark hasn't changed since 2008.\nOne resident asked whether the candidates would consider a property tax rate cut given increasing property values, which have caused residents' tax bills go up.\nGunsallus said he would consider it and that it has been discussed by the council. He said the town could work on increasing the number of business to bring in more commercial tax revenue.\nHe added that since joining the council in 2023, he's pushed for detailed reviews of the town's budget.\n\"Through my direction, this council has done something that it hasn't done in at least 30 years,\" Gunsallus said, \"and that is go line by line, every single line, in the $28 million budget to be just that: responsible stewards of the town's money.\"\nAbbatiello said during this year's budget discussions, he was against a property tax rate hike. He said a tax break is dependent upon the town's fiscal need.\n\"If we can afford to reduce taxes, great. I'm all in favor of that,\" Abbatiello said. \"I don't think we should just automatically say we're cutting taxes. We need to also look at other revenue sources.\"\nAbbatiello said he's focused on keeping the Easton Volunteer Fire Department a volunteer organization — since a shift to paid would be \"one of the biggest tax increases this town will ever see.\"\nWard 4's Cameron Keefe advocated for the town to continue funding its police department at a high level. He said he's \"absolutely immovable\" on fiscal transparency.\n\"I would like to — and I might be shooting myself in the foot — strike fear into the hearts of our representatives and let them know, the money we're spending is not ours,\" Keefe said. \"We have to have the people of Easton's best interests in mind.\"\nHOUSING\nDuring both the moderated and open question portions of the town hall, the need for more affordably priced homes was mentioned. Candidates offered different ideas to tackle the dilemma.\nJackson-Amis said the town should \"hold the developers responsible\" by requiring a percentage of units be affordable. She vouched for smart growth, and said the Town Council should have more say in approving housing projects.\n\"We need to be very strategic in what it is we desire, and then how that can be implemented,\" Jackson-Amis said. \"But the council is accountable for that. We're responsible. It's not the Planning Commission.\"\nDavis has lobbied for that same increase in council involvement. Tuesday, he told residents the town should buy land and partner with a housing developer or nonprofit.\n\"So, therefore, the people who work at Wawas can get a house that's around $200,000 because the town has purchased property,\" Davis said. \"I think we need to make that kind of investment for affordable housing in the Town of Easton, and we will meet the needs of the individuals in the community.\"\nWard 2 candidate Lynn Keefe emphasized the town should be thinking \"outside of the box\" when it comes to addressing housing and infrastructure problems.\n\"I really feel like we need to work on our green space here,\" she said. \"We need to look at different parts of housing, not just affordable housing through the government, but also sustainable neighborhoods.\"\nRankin, Lynn Keefe's opponent, said development is the most common issue he hears from residents. Rankin said it's important to attract health care professionals and young people to Easton while also keeping an eye on growth.\n\"It's really important that we properly manage these developments that are coming on to make sure that those potential concerns are mitigated,\" Rankin said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-05-03",
    "author": "MEGAN COOK",
    "content": "Gunsallus campaign flyer is misleading, outright false\n\n May 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MEGAN COOK | Section: Columns \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As someone who has worked hard to serve this community with honesty and transparency, I've always believed that facts should guide our public conversations, especially during an election. That's why I feel compelled to address several misleading and outright false claims circulating in recent campaign materials.When falsehoods are left unchallenged, it risks becoming accepted as fact. Our community deserves better. These tactics are part of an effort not to inform or unite us but to stir fear and falsely influence voters. That's not who we are in the Town of Easton, and it's not how we should conduct ourselves.\nOne candidate, Frank Gunsallus, has claimed he is the only council member in 30 years to have gone \"line by line\" through the town budget. That statement isn't just misleading, it's false and is a disservice to the many council members, past and present, who have worked diligently every year to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely. Every budget season involves careful review, discussion and difficult decisions. Suggesting otherwise dismisses the thoughtful and responsible work of others who have taken that duty seriously, including myself when I served on the council from 2009-2023.\nThe inclusionary zoning bill is still a work in progress, and no final version has been drafted. Since 2022, there have been numerous meetings and workshops with both the Town Council and Planning Commission. A dedicated task force, made up of volunteers who spent countless hours reviewing Easton's housing needs, was appointed to offer thoughtful recommendations. That group is still finalizing its report.\nTo claim the bill mandates high-density housing in every neighborhood is simply false and undermines the work of dozens of people trying in good faith to address a real challenge. The goal is simple: to make it possible for teachers, nurses, police officers and others who serve our town to actually live here. If an officer has sworn to protect and serve our town, they ought to be able to call it home.\nThe same flyer accuses the mayor and staff of quietly ushering in development with little or no public input. That's not only untrue, it's an insult to the hardworking staff, Planning Commission and community members involved in every step of our public planning process. Nothing is being \"snuck in.\" Transparency and community input are cornerstones of how we operate. Claims to the contrary are simply false.\nIt's also been claimed that I \"recruited\" three pro-mayor, pro-development candidates to run for Town Council. That's false. Two of the implied candidates are already serving on the council. One of them is running against Mr. Gunsallus not because of ideology, but out of concern over how meetings are managed, the lack of respect shown and civility and communication breakdowns among council members.\nMischaracterizing the motives of individuals who Mr. Gunsallus opposes is unfair and misleading. Voters should look for leadership that is respectful, collaborative and able to work with others, especially when navigating difficult issues. That's the kind of leadership Easton deserves.\nIt's also been suggested that because I wasn't born in Easton, I somehow care less or am less committed to this community. That's not only wrong, it's also deeply disrespectful. My husband and I moved to Easton 22 years ago for his job as a pediatrician and to be closer to his family. My work as mayor, as a former council member and my involvement in projects like Project Idlewild, CarePacks, coaching sports and serving on local boards and clubs, has always been about giving back to the place my husband and I chose to raise our family.\nAnd I'm far from alone. Many of the people who make meaningful contributions to Easton each day weren't born here. What matters is not where someone started, but the heart and effort they bring to serving this town.\nEaston is a town worth fighting for, not with fear or falsehoods, but with integrity, respect and a commitment to the truth. Elections should be about ideas, accountability, and the future we want to build together, not personal attacks or misleading claims. I will continue to stand up for the facts, for our hardworking staff and volunteers and for a community where we listen to each other even when we disagree. I encourage every voter to look past the lies, ask thoughtful questions and choose leaders who value collaboration, honesty and real public service. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Around 230 absentee ballots remain to be counted Wednesday.\nIn Ward 2, Rankin earned 493 votes Tuesday, a decisive lead over opponent Lynn Keefe's 228.\nIn Ward 4, incumbent the Rev.

Davis has 253 votes, with Cameron Keefe in second with 128 and Moonyene Jackson-Amis third with 103.\nAn impressive turnout of voters marked election day in Easton Tuesday, upward of 3,000 casting ballots.\nResidents began coming out to the Easton Volunteer Fire Department once polls opened at 7 a.m, and the steady pace continued through much of the day. In a Facebook post Tuesday afternoon, the town said turnout had the potential to be \"historic.\"\nThe town's Board of Canvassers will tally absentee ballots Wednesday and then formally certify the election.\nBoth in the morning and afternoon, the line for residents from Ward 3 stretched to outside the voting hall.\nAt one point early Tuesday afternoon, the line for voters went past the indoor lobby all the way to the outside doors of the building.\nTuesday evening, the turnout continued to be steady as many residents navigated a crowded parking lot to perform their civic duty.\nInside the fire hall, election supervisor Ed Forte and election judges swiftly assisted voters who were unsure of which wards they live in. Election judge Mariana Lesher called it a \"crazy\" good turnout.\nThe Easton Town Council had three of its five seats up for grabs, and all races were contested, including the council president race between incumbent Frank Gunsallus and current Ward 2 representative Don Abbatiello.\nIn Ward 2, Lynn Keefe and Robert Rankin were vying for the Abbatiello's current seat.

    "content": "Cambridge Indivisible aims to teach members about civics, cofounder says\n\n May 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 645\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — For Cambridge Indivisible cofounder and Cochair Michelle Fowle, it's about understanding the power you have.\"I think the really important thing is for people to understand the power that they actually hold,\" she said. \"So that's kind of my focus. And I'm doing that here.\"\nWhen Fowle moved to Cambridge from California with her husband, Andy, in September, the two hit the ground running to form Cambridge Indivisible, which is a chapter of a national organization that aims to elect progressive leaders.\nFowle said the overarching goal of the group is to give people a place to build community and learn about civics. She said everyone is welcome.\n\"We have Republicans who are showing up now at our protests, asking how they can help,\" she said. \"And I embrace them.\"\nMentioning health care and housing, Fowle said there are issues that people on both sides of the aisle can unite on. She said that for her, the organization isn't about identity politics.\n\"We don't have to agree,\" she said. \"In fact, we shouldn't agree. And it's healthy to have that conversation. I'm not trying to make you be me.\"\nThere was a time when Fowle knew very little about politics.\n\"They say that there's two days that are critical in your life,\" she said. \"It's the day you're born and the day you find out why. And in November 2016, I found out why.\"\nFowle said the 2016 general election results thrust her into a world of activism after not paying close attention to politics for many years. While living in California, Fowle learned from other organizers, helped put on rallies and marches, and built relationships with elected officials.\n\"For somebody who didn't know anything, I can teach it now,\" she said.\nMAKING WAVES\nIn recent months, Cambridge Indivisible has garnered attention over events it has hosted around town. During one event in March, the chapter hosted Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) for a town hall.\nThe chapter also has hosted multiple rallies to criticize elected federal leadership. That criticism has been largely directed toward Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) for not holding in-person town halls for his constituents. Harris hosted multiple virtual town halls in the past two months.\nFowle said the Cambridge chapter of Indivisible has more than 1,000 members from across the Eastern Shore. She said there is no formal registration process to be a member.\nCambridge Indivisible Treasurer Ilia Johnson said she joined the chapter this year to get more representation for the Hispanic community in the area and to support her neighbors. She said she likes that Cambridge Indivisible is a group \"for everybody.\"\n\"All we want to do is what's best for everybody,\" she said.\nDuring a Cambridge Indivisible rally held along U.S. Route 50 in Cambridge on April 19, Gloria McVeigh said she joined the chapter after Harris was elected in November. She said it's a nice group that holds the same values as herself.\nAlthough there have been disapproving shouts from people driving their cars past Cambridge Indivisible rallies these past few months, Fowle said the chapter hasn't faced much opposition other than from Harris.\nIn the past, Harris has shared his criticisms of and concerns with the Indivisible organization as a whole.\nFollowing a Cambridge Indivisible rally held March 13 that called on Harris to hold an in-person town hall and questioned his allegiance to his constituents, Harris alleged those at the rally were \"brought in by buses\" and not his constituents. He said he heard from a Washington, D.C., organization's leader \"who knows what's going on\" that people at the rally were getting paid to be there.\n\"This is AstroTurf,\" Harris said about the organization in March. \"This is not grassroots.\"\nFowle said the chapter does get internet trolls on its public page, and she deletes their comments and blocks them.\n\"It's like listen, when this hits you — and it will — I'll be there for you if you want,\" she said about the internet trolls. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Seafood odor dispute in Easton's 4th ward still simmering\n\n May 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 675\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As summer nears, disagreement between a local seafood processor and neighboring residents over odor mitigation efforts is resurfacing.Residents in Ward 4 have long complained of odor emanating from Chesapeake Brand Seafood on Maryland Avenue during crab season.\nIt led to action by the Easton Town Council last December. The town passed an ordinance requiring seafood processing operations to install odor control technology \"in such a manner that no odor\" could be detected.\nPer the ordinance, an odor control system must be installed by July 1. But Chesapeake Brand Seafood is now requesting an amendment to the ordinance, citing that industry experts say the \"no odor\" language is an unachievable goal.\nPeter Maloney, who lives around 500 feet from the business, has been a vocal neighborhood leader for affected residents. He says the odor makes it hard for his kids to enjoy time outside.\n\"It's not something we signed up for,\" said Maloney, who moved to Easton around five years before the business opened in 2019.\nHe added that Chesapeake Brand Seafood isn't acting as a good neighbor with its attempt to amend the already-approved ordinance.\n\"They're kicking the can down the road,\" Maloney said.\nAt Monday's Town Council meeting, the amendment was introduced and referred to the Planning Commission for review at its May 15 meeting. Town Council will still have the final say.\nIf passed, the amendment will remove the requirement that odor control systems act \"in such a manner that no odor from any product or by-product can be detected outside the building on the same property or on adjacent properties or public rights-of-way.\"\nReplacing the deleted language is, in part, the requirement that engineers or industry experts confirm the installed odor control equipment uses \"best control technologies and methods designed to mitigate odor before it leaves a building.\"\nOwner Mitch Hughes says his business requested the amendment due to the \"no odor\" language. He's looking for clarity over whether that mandate would be based on odor detection or resident complaints.\n\"Zero odor means I'm done completely,\" Hughes said. \"It's just not possible.\"\nHughes is ready to install the odor control technology, but he's holding off since he doesn't want to begin footing the $800 monthly cost if it won't end up meeting the ordinance.\n\"They all said we can install a system and get your odor down,\" he said. \"But there's no way you can reach zero odor.\"\nMaloney and other residents spoke in opposition to the proposed amendment Monday.\n\"I feel like I've earned my right to retire, and I don't want to have to do it inside my household,\" Carla Howell said.\n\"We are organized, and we are all very angry about this as you can hear,\" Emily Stone said. \"And we will not be quiet until something is done.\"\nWard 4 Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis, who pushed for the ordinance to be passed last year, said he's against any amendment.\n\"I think the ordinance as it stands is an excellent ordinance,\" Davis said. \"And the crab industry hasn't been a good neighbor.\"\nWard 1's Maureen Curry said Monday that Chesapeake Brand Seafood gave the council a \"flat-out no\" on the prospect of moving to a new location, likely one not in a residential area. Hughes, whose business was legally permitted by the town to locate on that property, says he's only against moving if he has to foot the full bill.\nHughes said the business has taken steps as requested by town code enforcement to reduce odor. Remaining complaints, he said, are due to the steaming process.\n\"It's kind of hard to fix the smell of steamed crabs,\" Hughes said. \"That's just part of the process. That is our process.\"\nBut Maloney and other residents said Monday the proposed amendment feels like a stall tactic from Chesapeake Brand Seafood as the July 1 deadline nears.\nMaloney said in an interview that the neighbors aren't looking to hurt a business. They are, however, fighting for what he calls a \"well-worded\" and effective ordinance to stand as originally approved.\n\"To loosen this at the expense of all property owners who have dealt with this for five years is unfair,\" Maloney said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Andy Harris, local Republicans take aim at Moore, talk '26 election cycle\n\n May 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: News \n \n 874\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — During the Caroline County GOP's annual Lincoln Reagan Dinner last week, U.S. Rep. Andy Harris and state Sen. Steve Hershey took aim at Gov. Wes Moore amid speculations he will make a 2028 presidential bid.Speaking to a room full of locally elected Republicans and Republican voters in Denton on Thursday evening, Harris (R-Md., 1st) acknowledged Moore's (D) frequent visits to the Eastern Shore.\n\"He's smooth. The guy's smooth,\" Harris said, pausing briefly. \"The guy's as liberal as the day is long,\" he added. \"The guy's a socialist.\"\nRumors of a potential Moore presidential run, though denied by the governor himself, have emerged amid his weeklong trip to Japan and South Korea last month and his slot as the guest speaker for a high-profile South Carolina Democratic fundraiser later in May.\nHershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) tackled the Moore speculations head-on, stating that the governor wouldn't make an appearance on ABC's \"The View\" just to remain governor. In Moore's May 1 spot on the daytime talk show, the governor repeatedly stated he is \"not running\" in 2028.\nFollowing his appearance on \"The View,\" Moore told CNN that he's focused on Maryland when asked whether he's ruling out a 2028 presidential campaign.\n\"I think anybody who is positioning themselves in 2025 for 2028 is not taking 2025 seriously,\" he said.\nBut Hershey was adamant that Moore will run for the presidential seat.\n\"It's going to end here in Maryland,\" Hershey said Thursday. \"That thing is going to go away, because we have done such a great job of holding him accountable for what has gone wrong in Maryland.\"\nMoore is up for reelection to his gubernatorial seat in 2026. He will face at least one Democratic primary challenger in the form of retired businessman Ed Hale.\nHershey was less confident about the Republican Party's chances to defeat Moore in the 2026 gubernatorial race, but maintained his hardline stance.\n\"They are going to spend more money on Wes Moore than any governor race probably in the country,\" Hershey said. \"Because people do think he's going to be the next president. And he cannot possibly lose a governor race in Maryland. But we're going to fight that. We're going to put a great candidate out.\"\nHershey proclaimed the 2025 General Assembly as the \"worst session\" he's experienced and said it is \"at the hands\" of Moore. He said that House and Senate Republicans will hold the governor accountable as next year's gubernatorial election nears.\nLOCAL ELECTIONS\nWhile Hershey emphasized that Republicans will focus on flipping a handful of seats in Maryland's General Assembly in 2026, other Republican leaders spoke to the importance of campaigning at an even more local level.\nNicole Harris, Andy Harris' wife and chairwoman of the Maryland Republican Party, said she and Executive Director Adam Wood have kept the party's efforts in town and county elections quiet.\n\"We didn't want the Democrats to catch on,\" she said. \"The Democrats have caught on over the last few weeks.\n\"So now we need all hands on deck. But we have flipped more seats in municipal elections than the Democrats have so far this year.\"\nNicole Harris said the state party is celebrating a sweep in last week's election in La Plata, a town in Charles County that is welcoming an entirely new council.\nJulie Quick, chair of the Caroline County Republican Central Committee, noted Preston's election of a new town commissioner as a recent Republican loss. In a race where only 36 residents voted, newcomer Scott Messick defeated incumbent Nelson Anderson in the non-partisan race.\n\"Had we gotten out the vote, we could've taken that election,\" Quick said.\nRepublican-endorsed candidates in the race for Easton Town Council went 0-for-3 in last week's election, a campaign cycle which sparked questions of whether political party influence is appropriate in nonpartisan local races.\nQuick acknowledged that some local candidates may not want endorsement from a political party. But she said the committee still needs to \"recruit good candidates\" and create a foundation to support the party's state delegates and senators.\n\"They're the bench, and we need a bench,\" Quick said of municipal candidates.\nHARRIS TALKS 2026\nThursday, Rep. Harris briefly made mention of Jake Day, the Department of Housing and Community Development secretary who's rumored to be considering a challenge of Harris for the 1st district seat that stretches the length of the Eastern Shore.\nDay confirmed to Maryland Matters earlier this month that he's raising money for an \"exploratory effort.\"\n\"Tax them till you leave office Jake Day,\" Harris told the crowd Thursday, likely referencing Day's time as mayor in Salisbury.\nWhen asked of Day's potential congressional bid in an interview with The Star Democrat after the event, Harris said, \"This is America. Anybody can explore.\"\n\"He's just not going to have any luck because he has a record.\"\nHarris added that he's focused on carrying out President Donald Trump's agenda — not his run for reelection next year.\nThe congressman did note that as chair of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, he offers a unique level of access that can benefit the residents he represents.\n\"It's an incredibly important role because it gives me access — immediate access to the president, to the White House, to leadership, to chairmen of committees,\" Harris said. \"All of whom will be able to influence what the federal government does that's good or bad for the 1st congressional district.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Planning Commission recommends against seafood odor amendment\n\n May 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 613\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Planning Commission Thursday provided an unfavorable recommendation on a recently proposed amendment to a seafood odor ordinance.The ordinance, which came after a multi-year push from Ward 4 residents, aims to address complaints of odor emanating from Chesapeake Brand Seafood, a facility located on Maryland Avenue near many homes. The legislation was passed in December, but a final resolution hasn't been reached.\nThe business recently requested an amendment to the already-approved ordinance, citing that industry experts consider legislation's requirements unachievable.\nIt requires the business to install odor control technology so \"that no odor ... can be detected outside the building on the same property or on adjacent properties or public rights-of-way.\" The deadline to install is July 1.\nOwner Mitch Hughes, attorney Zach Smith and the vendor of an odor control system explained Thursday that the ordinance isn't feasible as written.\nTheir amendment proposes a new standard — that engineers or industry experts confirm odor control equipment uses \"best control technologies and methods designed to mitigate odor before it leaves a building.\"\nCommission members agreed the proposed change was too vague. But they also acknowledged that the original ordinance doesn't create a clear path to compliance.\n\"I feel like we're trying to put a round peg in a square hole here,\" member Tom Klein said.\nChairperson Philip Toussaint said the business, which was legally permitted to operate by the town beginning in 2019, should've never been OK'd at that site.\n\"That's tough to hear when we, again, followed the town zoning codes,\" Smith said. \"It's tough to hear that position from the Planning Commission.\"\nSmith said the amendment is not an attempt by Hughes to avoid addressing the odor complaints. Hughes noted he's fully willing to install the odor control system, but he doesn't want to foot the cost if his efforts won't meet the ordinance.\nSmith said if the \"no odor\" requirement isn't changed, it leaves only two options: Chesapeake Brand goes out of business or involves the town in \"some sort of protracted legal battle.\"\nCommission members, along with some residents, criticized the business for proposing the amendment so soon before the July 1 deadline.\n\"If we had another month or two, it could've been doable,\" said William Ryall, the commission's chair pro tem.\nThe commission voted 4-0 to advise the Town Council to reject the amendment. But in that same motion, the commission directed the council to incorporate an \"enforceable standard\" into the already-approved legislation. Despite much discussion Thursday, it's not yet clear exactly what that standard might be.\nThe Town Council will still review the proposed amendment, likely considering the commission's advice to find a middle ground on a standard that can be met and enforced.\nPUBLIC INPUT\nPublic comment was mixed Thursday, with many of the residents affected by the odor in attendance to oppose Chesapeake Brand's amendment. Some suggested alternative ways to reach a compromise.\nShawn Nuthall said the amended wording has \"no teeth, no data, no standards.\"\n\"We've been going through this for years and years and years,\" he said. \"It's way, way too long. They should've done something before now.\"\nOthers, including some fellow business owners and seafood processors, spoke in support of Hughes and Chesapeake Brand Seafood.\n\"Mitch got a permit,\" Donna Bramble said. \"He did not hide what kind of business he was having. He told you what it was going to be. It's a signed, legal document, and now the town is trying to take that away.\"\nJoe Spurry, owner of Chesapeake Landing Seafood in St. Michaels, said Hughes has good intent and that the town should be wary of not driving the business away.\n\"He started a business that nobody starts,\" Spurry said. \"Processing seafood is a dying business. I'm one of the last in Talbot County. He's the newest.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Elmer Davis were sworn in by Mayor Megan Cook, marking the start of council's first meeting with its new makeup.\nAbbatiello defeated outgoing president Frank Gunsallus in a heated election on May 6. But all was cordial Monday night as Abbatiello shifted from his Ward 2 chair to the center seat on the dais.\nThe new council president thanked his wife and two kids, mother and sister, and town residents for their support during the campaign.\n\"We're facing a lot of challenges as a community,\" Abbatiello said. \"Growth, housing, access to medical care, traffic — these are just some of the things that we heard during the campaign that people are really concerned about. We do have some challenges ahead of us. And I'm looking forward to working toward solutions to those challenges.\"\nAbbatiello added of Gunsallus, \"Even though we disagreed and were at odds during the election, I want to thank Mr. Gunsallus for his service to the community over the last two years.\"\nGunsallus, whose term as president began in 2023, provided remarks before shaking hands with the rest of the council at the start of Monday's meeting.\n\"We haven't always agreed, but we've always shared the same goal: to do what's best for Easton,\" Gunsallus said. \"And for that, I am proud.\"\n\"To the new council, I wish you nothing but success as you take on the important work ahead,\" he added. \"May you lead with wisdom, listen with compassion and help Easton grow in a way that honors its past and embraces its future. I have every confidence that this town is in good hands.\"\nEaston residents came out in droves to vote on election day, with over 3,200 ballots cast, a town record for a municipal election. All three races were contested, but Abbatiello and Rankin secured decisive victories (69% of votes each) in two-person races while Davis won comfortably (54%) in a three-person race.\nAfter the swearing-in ceremony, Cook said she believes voters \"sent a clear message.\"\n\"They want to see respect and civility restored,\" Cook said. \"They want their local leaders focused and working together collaboratively to address the needs of our community.\"\nFollowing the meeting, council members shared excitement for the work ahead of them.\n\"I applaud all three of you for how you ran your campaigns, and I am delightful at the outcome,\" said Ward 1 representative Maureen Curry, who endorsed Abbatiello. \"And I am so looking forward to working with all of you.\"\nWard 3's David Montgomery, who made a somewhat surprising endorsement of Abbatiello during the campaign, said voters demonstrated a want for \"integrity, openness (and) clarity.\"\n\"I am looking forward very much to the next two years of working on this council and working together cooperatively, in a friendly manner, with respect for each other, even when we don't necessarily agree on everything,\" Montgomery said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The move would free up space for other organizations and town agencies, but it would leave the historical society without a permanent home.\nThough no decision was made Thursday, Councilman Joe Noon made it clear he feels the council and the town should make a decision very soon because the town needs the building.\n\"Mayor, council, this was already discussed,\" Noon said. \"We said that we were going to ask them to leave at one meeting, then we come back, then we say, 'we don't know if we want them to leave or not.' We need our building back.\n\"Let's stop playing with the historic society, please. You already know that we all need the building back. Let's just come up with the date.\"\nThe council members elected to hold a public hearing at the June 5 meeting, then make a decision on the historical society after the public hearing.\nCouncilwoman Christina Robinson and Councilman Pete Brelia said they had met with Greensboro Historical Society President Charles Dean and discussed multiple relocation options for the historical society.\nWhile Dean couldn't make it in person to Thursday's meeting, he told the Star Democrat that the he had a \"pleasant exchange\" with the council members.\n\"We had a pleasant exchange of ideas when we did meet,\" Dean said. \"It was not adversarial at all, nor did I think it would be, so I just look forward to the June 5 hearing and hope that the public would turn out to support the Greensboro Historical Society.\"\nRobinson and Brelia made points on different locations, but no location has been solidified and no final decision was made. The council members say they plan to continue to work towards a solution that would be best for both parties.\n\"We all value the historical society,\" Robinson said. \"We are trying to keep it within the town limits. No final decision has been made, but we're all aware that something needs to be done, and we are working to try and work out a solution that works out for everybody.\"\nDean assures residents that the Greensboro Historical Society will not be dissolved and will work to find a location if moved.\n\"If they vote to remove us from the Weaver building, they're not dissolving the historical society,\" Dean said. \"The Greensboro Historical Society will continue to exist. We will find a place for the collection even if the museum has to go dormant for some time, things will be in storage and eventually we'll find a better place and we will to continue to celebrate Greensboro's history at that point.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County Council approves 2026 budget\n\n May 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 434\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DORCHESTER — After receiving community feedback over removing the tax differentials for Cambridge and Hurlock, the Dorchester County Council worked with each other, County Manager Jerry Jones and county staff to modify the proposed county budget.The differentials, which lower tax rates in the municipalities to account for duplicated services, remain intact in the fiscal year 2026 budget passed by the County Council Tuesday.\nRather than removing the differentials, the county made adjustments to its budget including deferring all nonprofit funding to a later time.\nThe county's real property tax rate will increase by 3 cents across the board, bringing the overall tax rate to $1.03 per $100 of assessed value. Cambridge residents will pay 95.67 cents per $100 of assessed value, and Hurlock residents will pay 94.79 cents per $100 of assessed value.\n\"We came up with a product. Is it the best product in the world? Heck no. But it will suit the needs of the people in the county,\" said council member William Nichols in reference to the budget.\nAs Nichols voted in favor of the budget bill, he made a point to explain to the community that this was the worst budget he has seen in the 30 years he's sat on the council. Nichols said that there have been no hidden agendas and that he appreciates all the feedback.\nCouncil President Lenny Pfeffer is concerned the council will end up in the same position next year, with the state of Maryland expecting to reach a $6 billion deficit in the next two years if there are no significant changes.\nCouncil member Rob Kramer agreed with Nichols, saying this was the worst budget he's seen in the 20 years in his seat, but \"we made lemons out of lemonade.\"\nContention between the state capital and rural Maryland was brought up often. Kramer said he doesn't think Annapolis has any hope in rural Maryland, but at the same time, he doesn't have any hope in Annapolis.\nMaryland Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) attended the meeting Tuesday, assuring residents they have a voice in Annapolis. Hutchinson echoed the sentiments of the council members, saying there's a major disconnect between what happens in the capital and what happens in the community.\n\"I just ask you, please, when you hear us talking about this stuff next year, please, I ask you to write letters, please make phone calls, please be as active as possible in your community to relay to Annapolis that Dorchester County cannot continue to take the economic hits it has been,\" Pfeffer said before opening up the floor for comments.\nThe budget bill will take effect on July 1. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Legacy Bricks honor military veterans, memorialize the fallen\n\n May 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 961\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Memorial Day remembers U.S. servicemen and servicewomen who lost their lives defending this country's freedom and, as is the tradition, they will be honored during ceremonies at American Legions, VFWs, churches and so forth.At the North East Community Park, however, fallen servicemen and servicewomen are memorialized every day of the year — not just on Memorial Day. A spotlight also shines there on U.S. military veterans in general. That's because there is a flag-court-style monument comprised of bricks bearing the engraved names of those who made the supreme sacrifice, as well as of those who are veterans.\nDedicated last July 3 during the town's Salute to Cecil County Veterans ceremony and fireworks show, the monument at the base of a tall pole holding the U.S. flag and the MIA-POW banner is known as the Legacy Bricks Veterans Memorial.\n\"North East town leaders understand the importance of memorializing those who paid the ultimate price and of honoring those who served. Many of those bricks out there are in memory of those who lost their lives defending the United States. Other bricks honor those who served in the military. Every person who ever served in the military took an oath — I will risk my life defending this country,\" emphasized Gene Daley, who is commander of the North East Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 6027.\nDaley, who served in the U.S. Army from 1986 through 1995, when he received his honorable discharge at the rank of staff sergeant, noted that North East VFW contributed one of the engraved bricks that make up the memorial.\n\"We have a brick out there for POWs-MIAs. They never returned from war and it's likely that most, if not all, are dead,\" said Daley, who is a 1985 North East High School graduate.\nOf the more than 500 bricks cobbled together to create that special 320-square-foot area in the park, about 200 bricks already have been inscribed with names and other information about those servicemen and servicewomen who died while defending this country or about the military veterans. Each brick was bought for $75 by relatives of veterans and of those who lost their lives in service. They were purchased between November 2023 and January 2024 — the first ordering period.\nAbout 40 engraved bricks were added recently, reflecting purchases made by families between November 2024 and January 2025, marking the second wave. Every year, during a two-month period that starts on Veterans Day in November and ends on New Year's Day in January, relatives of servicemen and servicewoman who paid the ultimate price or of military veterans can purchase legacy bricks to honor their loved ones.\nThere are approximately 250 blank bricks right now, and they serve as placeholders for future Legacy Brick purchases. Once ordered, the company engraves the requested message on a brick and ships it to North East. Then a blank, placeholder brick is removed from the monument and the inscribed brick is put in its place.\n\"This installation provides a lasting tribute to the men and women who have contributed to our nation's freedom. It covers every single major military conflict, dating back to World War I. Anytime we, as a town, can honor a legacy, it's a powerful thing,\" said North East Assistant Town Administrator Grant Handley.\nNorth East Mayor Kelly Benson commented, \"These Legacy Bricks honor those in our community who have made the most selfless sacrifice of servicing our country. It is a privilege to have this memorial in our community park.\"\nSome of the inscribed bricks honor or memorialize servicemen and servicewoman who are or were Cecil County natives. Common information engraved on the bricks include name, branch of military, rank and duration of service and, when applicable, the conflict in which he or she served or in which he or she perished while serving.\n\"There also are personal messages on the Legacy Bricks, like, 'We miss you',\" Handley said. \"Some include cool nicknames, like 'Hell on Wheels', and the nicknames typically have something to do with the units that they served with.\"\nThe idea for a central monument in the park came about after Gold Star families had submitted plaques honoring their loved ones and asked the town to display them. Steve Riley, who works for Entech Engineering and is the town's contracted engineer, designed the Legacy Bricks Veterans Memorial.\n\"He did it for free, which was awesome. It was his way of contributing,\" Handley said.\nThe construction of the Legacy Bricks Veterans Memorial was included in a series of North East Community Park upgrades that totaled $343,828 and was covered by a combination of grants and other sources, such as the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). The overall project included two sand volleyball courts, a horseshoe pit, renovation of public bathrooms, new playground equipment, exercise stations along the walking trail, new handicap-accessible sidewalks and ramps to easily access park pavilions.\nDaley is thankful that he served in the Army, explaining, \"It gave me the confidence to do things that I didn't think I could ever do. It gave discipline. The military gives you a way to conduct yourself in your life.\"\nOne of the bricks in that town park memorial bears the name of Daley's late father, Felix Daley, who served in the U.S. Navy for about 20 years, starting during World War II. That brick, reflecting Felix Daley's service to his country, is a point of pride for his son and for his other surviving relatives.\nAs for Memorial Day, Daley commented, \"It is important that we remember those who gave their lives for our country. The surviving parents, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters and children will always feel that loss. Memorial Day is akin to the day when someone important to you dies. We must always remember them.\"\nFor more information on how to order a Legacy Brick, call 410-287-5801, ext 7106. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The tile display is as old as the park itself, which opened in the summer of 2007.\nMany of the nearly two-decade-old tiles include handprints, names or school classes. However, they are significantly worn and at the end of their lifespan, town officials say.\nEaston officials delayed the initial plan to remove the walkway in October following substantial community feedback. In a Facebook post last week announcing the June 2 removal date, the town stated it will remove the tiles and resurface and paint the wall. Tiles will not be retrievable.\n\"As there is no way to remove the tiles without damaging them and neighboring tiles, individual tiles can not be salvaged from this process,\" the town wrote.\nLast fall, community members spoke of memories they had from the tiles and the park overall. Many suggested a community art project replace the wall.\nEaston resident Michael McCormack said last fall he remembered painting his tile when he was 8 years old.\n\"You can see the weather, you can see the time has taken its toll on those things for sure,\" McCormack said at the time. \"So you can see why they need to be taken down. It's just one of those things that I don't think people in the town really appreciated until they realized it was going to be gone.\"\nThe town has posted a gallery of the Idlewild Park tile wall on its website. The town's parks and recreation department is open to hearing suggestions on how the space should be used in the future.\nTo reach the town, email parksrec@eastonmd.gov. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This has to be a partnership. This should not be a combative relationship,\" Executive Director of Police Training and Standards Commission Wayne Silver said.\nThe committees and boards were formed as a result of the Maryland Police Accountability Act of 2021, which aimed to create a system for evaluating and investigation complaints against law enforcement agencies.\nThe county implemented the accountability board, charging committee and trial boards when required by the state. But the exact duties and appearances of these boards are still being fine-tuned through the county's legislative processes.\nSilver talked with the county commissioners about the trends seen in other counties and about how these counties implemented the boards and committees.\nOne of the questions presented by the commissioners asked about the subpoena power of the charging committee. Silver gave insight on how subpoena power should be implemented.\n\"To my knowledge, Caroline County is the only county to ever subpoena an officer,\" Silver said. \"The ACC does not have subpoena authority... Our position on this, ladies and gentlemen, is that it is the law enforcement agency that would issue the subpoena if it was necessary.\"\nIn December, law enforcement officials from multiple counties gathered at a Caroline County Commissioners meeting, bringing concerns about an incident involving a Caroline County sheriff's deputy and its implications for police accountability practices throughout the state.\nThe deputy, who was not named, was investigated by the administrative charging committee about a harassment complaint. Committee members invited the deputy to meet with the committee regarding the complaint, a move considered by some sheriff's departments to be \"not proper protocol\" or an \"overreach.\"\nAfter a 40-minute conversation with Silver on Tuesday, the commissioners opened the public comment period for the legislative bill.\nWhile no one spoke during the public comment period, the county received multiple letters from the Police Accountability Board and Administrative Charging Committee and a letter from Denton Chief of Police George Bacorn on behalf of other chiefs in Caroline County.\nAfter discussion, some of the important changes made within the legislative bill establishing the roles and powers of the boards include:\nClarifying definitions and language and correcting grammar errors.Adjusting requirements of board members, including removing the three-year residency requirement and allowing members to attend meetings virtually. The commissioners will also appoint an alternate member of the Police Accountability Board.Removing subpoena language from the legislation. The ACC recommended paragraph removal on subpoena responsibilities, but commissioners decided to the remove \"subpoenas\" sentence from the paragraph. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot, Queen Anne's counties included on Trump's list of 'sanctuary jurisdictions'\n\n May 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 636\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Talbot and Queen Anne's counties have been listed as \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" by the Trump administration, a label disputed by officials from both counties.President Donald Trump issued an executive order last month instructing DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to track the jurisdictions the administration considers to be defying the president's immigration crackdown efforts.\nOn Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security published a list of more than 500 jurisdictions across the country, stating that those jurisdictions are \"defying federal immigration law.\"\nQueen Anne's and Talbot officials challenged the claim Friday. In a statement, Queen Anne's County called the sanctuary designation \"wholly inaccurate.\"\n\"Queen Anne's County has never adopted or endorsed sanctuary policies, nor have we enacted any ordinances or resolutions that would shield individuals in violation of federal immigration law,\" the statement read.\nTalbot County said it received no communication from the federal government that it wasn't complying with federal immigration laws in advance of the list being published.\n\"We have, and will continue to, follow all applicable federal laws and have not taken any deliberate actions to obstruct their enforcement,\" a statement from a Talbot County spokesperson read.\n\"We welcome further information and guidance from the federal government so we can address any pertinent issues,\" the statement added.\nThe DHS website states that jurisdictions were designated \"sanctuary\" based on the following factors: \"compliance with federal law enforcement, information restrictions, and legal protections for illegal aliens.\"\nNoem said in a DHS press release about the list of jurisdictions that the department is \"exposing these sanctuary politicians who harbor criminal illegal aliens and defy federal law.\"\n\"These sanctuary city politicians are endangering Americans and our law enforcement in order to protect violent criminal illegal aliens,\" Noem said.\nAs part of Trump's effort to label \"sanctuary jurisdictions,\" federal agencies are directed to identify federal grants and contracts for potential \"suspension or termination, as appropriate,\" per the president's executive order.\nTalbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said in an interview Friday he's concerned for the status of a federal grant that goes to the Talbot County Sheriff's Office. This year, the agency received $40,000 to increase patrol efforts in Trappe, a town without its own police department.\nThe grant — which is administered annually — has led to a number of arrests and reduced crime, Gamble said.\n\"We hope that we can reapply and renew that grant,\" he said.\nTalbot County's inclusion on the list was a \"total shock\" to Gamble, who says his office has always complied with immigration agents. \"They haven't asked us to do anything,\" he said. \"We haven't said no to anything.\"\nGamble said he's spoken with the former and current Maryland ICE directors, both of whom indicated they are unsure of why Talbot County is listed.\nQueen Anne's County Sheriff Gary Hofmann expressed similar sentiments. He said Friday he's not aware of any actions by his office or the county government that could lead to the sanctuary designation.\n\"This is continued misinformation that's been perpetuated now,\" Hofmann said. \"I've heard this for a couple years, so it's of no surprise.\"\nUnder Trump, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, has ramped up agreements with local law enforcement agencies, referred to as 287(g) agreements, to carry out immigration crackdown efforts. ICE has signed nearly 700 of these agreements nationwide and seven in Maryland.\nNeither Talbot County nor Queen Anne's County are currently engaged in 287(g) agreements. Hofmann and Gamble said since the sheriff's offices aren't in charge of the counties' jails, they can't enter into jail enforcement agreements with ICE like other Maryland counties have.\nHofmann noted the Queen Anne's sheriff's office was eligible for ICE's Secure Communities program, a separate and now defunct effort where local agencies submitted fingerprints of those arrested to the federal government. Fingerprints were cross-checked with immigration databases.\nHofmann added that since it ended, his office \"hasn't changed on how we deal with criminals,\" emphasizing a \"zero tolerance\" approach.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Officials from both counties and Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) have challenged the designations.\nWhen the list published Thursday, the DHS website stated that the so-called sanctuary jurisdictions are \"defying federal immigration law.\" In April, President Donald Trump issued an executive order instructing DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to track the jurisdictions considered to be defying the president's immigration crackdown efforts.\nAs of Monday, the website doesn't include the list and shows a \"Page Not Found\" error.\nQueen Anne's County officials said in a statement Friday that the sanctuary designation was \"wholly inaccurate.\" Talbot County officials said the county had received no communication from the federal government regarding the designation.\nOn Saturday, Harris released a statement echoing the local pushback to the list.\n\"Although there are Maryland counties and municipalities that unfortunately consider themselves sanctuary jurisdictions (including Baltimore County in the First Congressional District), Queen Annes County and Talbot County are certainly not,\" Harris wrote. \"Our office is actively urging the administration to rectify this designation, freeing up federal resources to appropriately deal with those jurisdictions who refuse to comply with federal immigration law.\"\nOn Sunday, Noem appeared on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo. The host asked Noem about the list.\n\"I saw that there was a list produced,\" Bartiromo said. \"Now the list I don't see anymore in the media. Do you have a list of the sanctuary cities that are actually hiding illegals right now?\"\nNoem did not directly address the list's removal.\n\"Some of the cities have pushed back,\" Noem responded. \"They think because they don't have one law or another on the books, they don't qualify. But they do qualify. They are giving sanctuary to criminals ...\"\nAccording to the Associated Press, a DHS official said the list is constantly under review and can be changed at any time. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Five burial plots were discovered.\nCherrywood Solar brought the team back to do an ground-penetrating radar to see if there were any more potential burial sights. Once the final report from that test comes back, the Burial Sites Preservation Board in Caroline County will review that data and make a recommendation of what area needs to be protected.\nCherrywood Solar, produced by NextEra Energy Resources LLC, is a 145-megawatt project in Caroline County.\nNextEra Energy Resources sent a press release to the Star Democrat Wednesday stating, \"We are cooperating with Caroline County and other pertinent agencies on the investigation. Once we receive clearance from the relevant authorities, we will resume construction activities.\"\nAll parties involved believe that there was no foul play involved. They are believed to be human remains of family members from previous property owners.\n\"Given the fact that the house on this farm is a late 1800s house, most likely it was a family burial plot that could date back that far,\" Dadds said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County to revisit removing DEI statement with airport's federal funding at risk\n\n June 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 635\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot County Council will revisit the prospect of removing its diversity, equity and inclusion statement amid concerns for Easton Airport's federal funding.Though voted down in March, a resolution to remove the diversity statement found in the county's employee handbook is on the agenda for Tuesday's council meeting. Its reappearance is fueled by a directive from U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that could put millions of dollars for an ongoing Easton Airport project at risk, council members say.\nThe diversity statement — created after the passage of a 2020 resolution — defines diversity, equity and inclusion, explains its purpose and details the county's approach to ensuring diversity. It also outlines how employees can report discrimination.\nIn an April 24 letter, Duffy outlined the department's interpretation of federal law, including regarding DEI.\n\"Whether or not described in neutral terms, any policy, program, or activity that is premised on a prohibited classification, including discriminatory policies or practices designed to achieve socalled 'diversity, equity, and inclusion,' or 'DEI,' goals, presumptively violates Federal law,\" Duffy wrote.\nDuffy wrote that noncompliance with federal law or \"failure to cooperate\" with federal agencies \"could lead to a loss of Federal funding from DOT.\"\nEaston Airport's ongoing modernization project — which will relocate and expand the airport's main runway — is 90% funded by the Federal Aviation Administration, an organization within DOT. The airport is owned and operated by Talbot County.\nThe resolution to remove Talbot County's DEI statement was initially proposed by council member Dave Stepp in February. It elicited strong resident opposition, stirred two heated council meetings and split the five-member council.\nThe council rejected the statement's removal in March by a 3-2 vote: President Chuck Callahan joined Stepp, while Vice President Pete Lesher and council members Keasha Haythe and Lynn Mielke opposed.\nBut now, Stepp and Lesher are sponsoring the resolution's reappearance after working together to tweak it given the recent DOT directive. Lesher said he supports it \"without enthusiasm.\"\n\"The two of us came together, knowing that we are coming at this from different points of view,\" Lesher said in an interview Monday.\nThey both say passing the resolution will protect essential federal funds for the Easton Airport's modernization project. Stepp said $46.8 million is at risk.\n\"I think that folks didn't think this was real prior,\" Stepp said of the funding risks. \"And they certainly will now.\"\nLesher said he's confident the county isn't violating what the Trump administration and DOT are targeting. But merely having the DEI statement, he said, could lead to blowback from what he called a \"capriciously\" acting administration.\n\"Does this feel like extortion? Yes,\" Lesher said. \"We have to choose our battles. And I believe that what we are giving up here is important for appearances, but it is not substantive. We are not changing any policies in Talbot County by issuing this new administrative resolution.\"\nThe two sponsors of Tuesday's resolution offered slightly different interpretations of what it will do if passed.\nLesher said it would supersede the 2020 resolution and either lead to the removal or revision of the DEI statement so that it doesn't \"presumptively violate\" Duffy's directive.\nCouncil can't \"un-direct\" staff to create the statement, Lesher said. Instead, he said, the resolution serves as \"fresh direction.\"\nStepp, meanwhile, indicated the measure would completely repeal the 2020 resolution and remove the DEI statement, which is how the resolution was initially presented when it failed.\n\"It was fiscal responsibility then, and it's fiscal responsibility now,\" Stepp said.\nThe updated resolution will be read aloud Tuesday and potentially voted on. Lesher and Stepp both say they expect it to pass.\n\"We cannot afford to put the airport funding at risk,\" Lesher said. \"It just would leave us in the middle of a project. It would really leave us in a lurch.\"\nThe Talbot County Council meets at 5 p.m. Tuesday in the Talbot County Courthouse Bradley Meeting Room. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot council, planning commission weigh in on controversial short-term rental restrictions\n\n June 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 567\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot County Planning Commission members are largely skeptical of proposals to increase regulations on short-term rentals in the county.During a joint workshop with the County Council on Tuesday, the commission reviewed legislation sponsored by council members Lynn Mielke and Pete Lesher. Planning Commission members said they struggled to understand why stricter rules for short-term rentals were necessary.\nCommission Member Chip Councell said some of the proposed items are more of a \"hindrance\" than an improvement to the county's existing rules.\n\"I would almost support an easing of some of the restrictions more so than getting more stringent,\" Councell said. \"I'm struggling to see this as a balance.\"\nMielke has previously said the legislation was drafted amid a \"proliferation\" of short-term rentals in Talbot County, noting her concerns for St. Michaels village communities such as Bentley Hay and Rio Vista.\nMielke said Tuesday that in village zones, some communities don't have covenants or restrictions on the temporary rentals. County attorney Patrick Thomas, who helped draft the legislation, noted it can be \"tricky\" to change covenants since many require 75 to 80% of homeowners to agree.\n\"They can be overwhelmed by short-term rentals, so the idea was to sort of make a distinction,\" Mielke said.\nMielke added that an increasing number of short-term rentals are \"being scooped up by investors,\" which she says is hurting the county's affordable housing stock. Planning Commission members disagreed.\n\"I don't see where this is a proliferation,\" Councell said, citing that the number of licensed short-term rentals hasn't significantly increased or reached 200 in the last few years.\n\"They're taking them from subpar to show pieces for people to come down and enjoy,\" said commission chair James Corson. \" … I don't think the majority of these are even in that range of affordable housing.\"\nSome of the new restrictions if the legislation is passed would include: mandatory landlines; more detailed stay logs for license renewals; a seven-night minimum stay for lease holders in residential and village districts; and a split of licenses into two classes based on if the property is the applicant's primary residence.\nAs drafted, properties that aren't the applicant's primary residence would face new license limits: one license per 500 or 1,000 feet, depending on the zoning district.\nThe proposals have drawn support from a number of residents around the county but sharp criticism from short-term rental property agents and owners who view them as government overreach.\nProperty owners already must go through a review board to obtain or renew a license to operate a short-term rental. Most license requests are granted.\nCorson raised qualms with how the proposed seven-night minimum stay could deter tourists from attending weekend events such as the Waterfowl Festival. Lesher acknowledged it's \"largely a weekend business\" and said he's comfortable keeping the current three-day minimum in place.\nCounty Council member Dave Stepp weighed in against proposals for more detailed logs and required landlines.\n\"To have that legislation in there, it just doesn't make any sense,\" he said of the landlines.\nNo official changes were made to the draft regulations Tuesday. The commission will hold a public hearing and discuss the legislation at its July 2 meeting. A recommendation will then be made to the council, likely with significant revisions to the original proposals.\nPlanning Commission vice chair Michael Strannahan said the issue comes down to preserving the balance between economic benefits and maintaining the county's complexion.\n\"It's the old growth versus character thing we face all the time,\" Strannahan said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton council maintains seafood odor ordinance, rejects amendment\n\n June 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 678\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Easton Town Council on Monday rejected a proposal to relax language in a seafood odor ordinance that has been a topic of contention between residents and a local business for much of the last year.In a 4-1 decision, with council member Maureen Curry the lone yes, the council voted down an amendment proposed to change the wording of the odor law that takes effect July 1.\nThe town's ordinance, passed back in December, is meant to address resident complaints of odor from Chesapeake Brand Seafood on Maryland Avenue, a crab processing facility near many homes. Per the ordinance, the business must install odor control technology and do so \"in such a manner that no odor ... can be detected.\"\nWhile attorney Zach Smith said Monday that an odor control system was recently installed, he appealed to the council to accept the amendment. Smith and Chesapeake Brand Seafood owner Mitch Hughes have said the \"no odor\" standard is unachievable, citing industry experts. They've expressed concern that once the ordinance goes into effect, further complaints could leave them out of compliance and force them to close the business.\nWard 2 representative Robert Rankin visited the business last week and said on one hand, he's \"optimistic and hopeful\" the new odor system will address the residents' complaints.\n\"On the other hand, it just being installed over the weekend, it doesn't give a lot of time to measure success,\" Rankin said.\nWard 4 representative the Rev. Elmer Davis said it's a \"wait-and-see\" approach. \"We may have to look at our (original ordinance) and make sure that it has teeth,\" he said.\nWard 3's David Montgomery said he wished there was a more obvious correct decision. He said the focus will turn to town code enforcement on how future complaints or violations are dealt with.\nDuring more than 40 minutes of public comment on the topic, multiple residents said the smell hasn't gone away since the system was installed. A Chesapeake Brand employee noted the system may take some time to be fully dialed in.\nThose who spoke included family and friends of Hughes or local watermen. Some criticized the town for issuing the restrictions targeted toward Chesapeake Brand, a business that was legally permitted by the town and opened in 2019.\n\"There's been a negative portrayal of my cousin in the paper and on social media when in fact it should be the town that is to blame for all of this drama,\" said Kim Gibbons-Neff, Hughes' cousin.\n\"The town should have nipped this in the bud after the initial complaints and told the residents that the business is in compliance and they are doing nothing wrong,\" she added.\nLocal business owner Donna Bramble said the town could be losing trust with small businesses.\n\"As a business owner, how can small businesses trust the Town of Easton if you issue a permit, they put the expense in of starting their business, and then because there's a complaint, you force them to move?\" Bramble asked. \"And that's really what's happening. You're going to force Mitch to close up and move.\"\nPeter Maloney, one of the residents who's led calls for reduced odor from the business, said residents don't have anything against Hughes or small businesses.\n\"They got a legal permit to be there. And that is a question you all need to ask, as to why that legal permit was given,\" Maloney said toward the council. \"But that doesn't mean that they should be there.\"\nSmith, the attorney, warned the council that its \"authority here is not limitless.\"\n\"While the town can certainly adopt new standards to some extent, you can't adopt standards that are going to preclude him from continuing to operate his business,\" Smith said.\nFollowing the public hearing and vote, council President Don Abbatiello said people on both sides made valid points and that it wasn't an easy decision to reject the business' amendment.\n\"But at the end, at least for myself, it's responsibility to represent the residents,\" Abbatiello said. \"And my hope is that going forward, this mitigation process will work, and the facility will be able to stay there and be successful.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Donovan wins Oxford commissioner seat\n\n June 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 518\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — Dave Donovan won the Oxford town commissioner election by 44 votes Tuesday after a sometimes tense race.Residents cast their ballots for either Donovan or incumbent Tom Costigan between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. or by absentee ballot. On Tuesday, 326 voters showed up, and 71 voters cast absentee ballots.\n\"It's quite gratifying,\" Donovan said after hearing the results. He said it was hard to tell if the news was good when he initially received the phone call from Oxford's Board of Elections Supervisors Tuesday night. \"They're very matter of fact. They have a form they read to you, so you don't really know what the punch line is until the end.\"\nDonovan will serve a three-year term as an Oxford commissioner.\nThe town's elections took a new shape this year, with the Board of Elections overseeing the process after residents voiced concerns over transparency.\nThe board instituted two new rules that chair Debbie Krolicki said went smoothly during Tuesday's voting process. Krolicki said residents now have to bring proof of domicile and identification, measures taken in order to prevent \"temporary residents\" who do not live in the town year-round from voting.\n\"About 95% of our voters have brought their IDs,\" Krolicki said. \"They're very happy about our new process, but it's a new process.\"\nAccording to Costigan, the past three elections have become increasingly \"ugly\" and contentious. \"People should treat each other with a little bit of respect and a little bit of courtesy, you know?\" he said Tuesday afternoon.\nDonovan and Costigan both referenced separate \"smear campaigns\" that have spread throughout the town during campaigning.\n\"I was surprised that they waited until the last minute when they knew there was no opportunity for me to address it, which I thought was underhanded,\" Donovan said in reference to emails sent to town residents Sunday questioning Donovan's motivations.\nThough tension was building between candidates, the atmosphere on Election Day was relatively light. The Board of Elections livestreamed the vote count inside the Oxford Community Services Building.\nResident Carol Griggs said she came out to vote in this election because of pressing issues at hand, particularly town finances and the Strand Beach project.\n\"You know, we need a little change here,\" she said. \"We need things to move forward.\"\nGriggs said this election has drawn more community attention than previous elections due to all the \"hot button issues\" at hand like town finances and the Strand project.\nCostigan said he was disappointed with the results of the election and in some ways disappointed with the people of Oxford. \"I've served in this town for 15 years, and they decided to bring on somebody new. I understand that, that's their choice,\" Costigan said.\nDonovan will be sworn in as the new town commissioner on July 3. \"Honest to God, I think this is a win for everybody in Oxford,\" he said. \"There's still a small number of people that may be upset by this, but I also believe that those people are just as important to the outcome as anybody else in town, and I will represent them as if they voted for me. I hope that I can earn their trust.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'Proven leader': Easton will soon welcome Kitzrow as new town manager\n\n June 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 740\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — After nearly a year without a permanent town manager, Easton will welcome Andy Kitzrow next month.Kitzrow, the current Salisbury city administrator, was tapped by Mayor Megan Cook to assume the post from Police Chief Alan Lowrey, the interim town manager since August. Kitzrow begins July 7.\nDuring an interview in Salisbury last week, Kitzrow said he instantly noticed opportunity in Easton.\n\"The more I looked at Easton, the more I started to fall in love with where they're going,\" Kitzrow said.\nThe new town manager is Cook's most major appointment in her two years as mayor. Kitzrow will oversee town operations, lead department heads and town staff, and be a point of contact with the mayor and Town Council members.\nAfter whittling down a list of around 12 semifinalists, the town conducted full-day interviews with four finalists. It was an intensive but worthwhile process, Cook said.\nShe felt Kitzrow rose above the others, as he was up to speed on what's happening in Easton and meshed well with her and with town employees.\n\"(Staff) really thought of the candidates, he could get up and running the fastest because he had the background of Maryland politics,\" Cook said.\nKitzrow, 42, served as Wicomico County recreation superintendent before becoming Salisbury's deputy city administrator in 2017 and city administrator in 2023.\nIn Salisbury, Kitzrow worked under three different mayors, including Jake Day, now the Department of Housing and Community Development secretary. Day noted Kitzrow's oversight of city permit and procurement operations as especially impactful.\n\"It's not easy work, but he's a proven leader,\" Day said of Kitzrow. \"Somebody who can do it.\"\nCook says while the Day connection didn't factor into her decision, it will benefit Easton as the town tackles its own housing challenges and initiatives.\n\"Having that relationship, I think, is great. It's key,\" Kitzrow said. \"A lot of this is about relationships, whether they are elected officials or state officials.\"\nA BETTER FIT\nWorking under three different mayors, Kitzrow says he's experienced three very different visions.\nIn early 2023, Day left Salisbury with then-city administrator Julia Glanz to head up the state's housing and community development efforts. Jack Heath served as mayor until current Mayor Randy Taylor won an election later that year.\nDuring Day's tenure, Salisbury undertook a number of efforts to redevelop its downtown through programs providing tax incentives to developers, such as \"Here is Home\" and HORIZON — the latter aimed at bringing multifamily residential and hotel units, an initiative which Kitzrow championed.\n\"(He was) the mastermind behind the HORIZON legislation that we passed locally,\" Glanz said.\nTaylor and developers have clashed in recent months over the stalling of downtown projects, some of which were approved by former mayors and councils. In April, DelmarvaNow.com reported that developers of a downtown project filed a $40 million lawsuit against Salisbury and Taylor.\nWhile Kitzrow believes the change in vision is OK and can be solved through compromise, he acknowledges it factored into his choice to accept the Easton post. Neither Taylor nor Heath could be reached for an interview.\n\"Professionally and personally, the town that Megan wants to run and her goals align more with what I value and what I want to be part of,\" Kitzrow said.\nGOALS IN EASTON\nSalisbury's population is nearly double Easton's, but Kitzrow sees similar challenges and opportunities in the two areas.\nHe said he wants to \"move projects forward in a smart way.\" In Salisbury, he's dealt with a housing pipeline of around 5,000 units and led a focus on building \"from the inside out.\" Easton's pipeline has recently hovered around 1,000 units.\nKitzrow is hoping to bring a focus to Easton's Rails to Trails network, given his parks and recreation background, as well as get \"under the hood\" in the human resources department.\nCook said she's excited to bring on a consistent leader during what she says has been a year full of change in town. \"I'm looking forward to a steady ship ... and some calm seas ahead,\" Cook said.\nWorking for the mayor, Kitzrow emphasized that strong relationships with the Town Council will be crucial in completing the work that will make Easton a better place.\n\"We are working together, not against each other, and I think that's important,\" Kitzrow said.\nKitzrow will remain living in Salisbury with his wife and kids. He owns Escape Salisbury, a downtown escape room business.\nBut he's looking to learn as much about Easton as possible. He said he's especially excited to meet business owners, nonprofit leaders and community members in his first 60 days on the job. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Queen Anne's County eyes solar soil development fees\n\n July 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 779\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In response to the Renewable Energy Certainty Act, Queen Anne's County Commissioners considered an emergency ordinance to give a semblance of control back to the county and try to reap soil development fees. It is a tactic no other jurisdiction has yet tried.On May 20, the General Assembly put forward and Gov. Wes Moore approved Senate Bill 931/Renewable Energy Certainty Act that address specific state siting requirements of solar energy generating systems, community solar energy generating systems, establishes siting and standards, and energy storage devices.\nTaking effect July 1, this Senate bill establishes a (new, higher) 5% limit to the total acreage of the combined number of solar energy generating stations that may be approved for construction in the priority preservation areas.\nIt also gives the Public Service Commission the power to approve solar and energy storage projects that meet specific conditions, even if local jurisdictions object; aims to expedite the permitting process for solar projects; addresses the use of agricultural land for solar development, including provisions for priority preservation areas; and also includes some minor provisions for local (county) input on project design and implementation.\nWhile complying with the new rules in Senate Bill 931, Queen Anne's County is now pushing the envelope to try and recoup money from the state permitting solar to be placed on county Class 1 soils, Commissioner Jack Wilson said.\nAccording to Wilson, Queen Anne's County is seeking to impose an impact fee on soils used for development of solar through a per-acre financial contribution to be made to the county when solar energy generating stations and storage devices are developed on Class 1 soils.\nThe fee will be based on the rates used in the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) process, which is recognized by the state, according to Wilson.\n\"It's like if you were going to collect this and pay this for this land, we should be reimbursed at the same level,\" Wilson said.\nWith concerns for the Maryland Ag Land Preservation Fund not being supported by the state over the next few years, the proposed impact fee or Compensatory Preservation Contribution on solar generating systems and storage sites is a way to recoup money for further land preservation, Wilson said.\nThe contribution or soil impact fee will be based upon 50% of the fair market value appraisal as determined by the annual amount, according to Amy Moredock county planning and zoning director, and directed to the county Farmland Preservation Fund.\nSenate Bill 931 differs from similar recent cannabis legislation because it doesn't let counties create additional use standards, Moredock said. This means the county must remove all existing utility-scale solar standards and definitions and apply new standards instead.\nThe Senate bill addresses community solar, which the county's ordinance did not have specific provisions for and also requires the county address energy storage siting, Moredock said.\nSolar is permitted in Queen Anne's countryside, agricultural, and industrial zoning districts, according to Moredock.\nThe county code has kept solar out of mixed use zoning districts, and high and medium density residential zoning districts, she said.\nIn accordance with the law, Queen Anne's County was also able to prohibit solar in Tier One and Tier Two growth areas and surrounding growth areas often zoned agriculture. This would prohibit siting within areas that are slated for development and municipal growth, she said.\nDonna Landis-Smith and Joe Pippin of Queen Anne's County Soil Conservation helped solidify a compensatory preservation contribution, a payment into the dedicated farmland preservation fund to assist with obtaining easements, Moredock said.\nThe law is written that the 5% applies to the definite article Priority Preservation Area and does not have a caveat as to when that calculation begins, Moredock said.\nEasements already preserved are not included in the total Priority Preservation Area numbers, she said.\nAs listed in the 2022 Comprehensive Plan, the county has approximately 109,000 acres available for the 5% designated for solar, according to Moredock.\nOf the 238,000 acres in the county, approximately 88% of it is zoned agricultural and ag use, according to Landis-Smith. At the time of the previous comprehensive plan, there were 83,684 acres preserved and since the adoption of the 2022 Comprehensive Plan, the county has preserved an additional almost 8,000 acres, Landis-Smith said.\nThe county currently has 1,100 acres in solar.\nThe commissioners have noted there is a good chance the impact fee proposal would get challenged, Wilson said.\nMoredock credited the expertise of Queen Anne's County Geographical Information Systems Coordinators Sam Stanton and Tyler Pease for their understanding of land use to be able to present clear statistics.\nThe introduction of the ordinance will move forward to the planning commission for more discussion and a public hearing scheduled in two weeks.\nThe Queen Anne's County Commissioners will next meet July 8 at 5:30 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We just haven't quite been able to put the pieces to the puzzle together, and so I'm excited that Kathleen and the commissioners have an interest in beginning those conversations again.\"\nThe current YMCA facility is an 11,000-square-foot storefront facility that is in Denton just off of state Route 404 in a shopping center. While the facility provides service to Caroline County residents a new facility would potentially look something like the new facilities built around the Mid-Shore.\n\"if you look at the YMCA that just opened at Centerville, it's a 70,000-square-foot facility serving a little over 7,000 people,\" Gill said. \"...They're really built specifically to meet specific community needs.\"\nThe new facilities around the Mid-Shore have congregate meals daily for older residents in the community. To service the elderly, the YMCA partners with multiple groups around the community.\nThe new facilities include a six-lane pool with a shallow depth entry, allowing chances for swim classes for kids and adults. Another feature included is a double gymnasium with an indoor walking track, giving residents options for physical activity on cold and hot days.\nTwo other features includes multiple program open spaces and after-school care programs that will be beneficial for Caroline County Public Schools.\nWhile their is no timeline on a new YMCA, Gill is happy that conversations have started again. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Larry Hogan proclaimed he had no interest in running for an open U.S. Senate seat in Maryland formerly held by Ben Cardin.\nHogan went as far as saying his experience as a business executive and eight years serving as governor, left him reluctant to serve in a deeply divided legislative body marked by lengthy and often bitterly partisan dialogue and decision making.\nThen in February 2024 Hogan entered the Senate race where he easily won the Republican nomination in a primary election but lost in the general election with 42.8% of votes cast.\nIn 2022, Wes Moore was elected as Hogan's Democratic successor with 64.5% of votes cast.\nAlmost immediately following his election Moore was widely viewed by political pundits in Maryland, Washington, D.C., and nationally as a potential presidential candidate in 2028.\nTo date, Moore has said early and often regularly he is not pursuing that goal.\nDespite saying that, it has been most interesting watching media reports of what Moore has done in the political arena during his first term as governor.\nMoore ...\nSpoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention.Campaigned for Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Michigan.Campaigned for Democratic candidates in Virginia.Appeared on The View where Joyce Behar told him he looked \"very presidential.\"Interviewed with CNN following his college commencement speech in southeastern Pennsylvania.Attended an Aspen Colorado fundraiser hosted by Damian O'Doherty, a Maryland political operative and co-founder of Baltimore based KO Public Affairs.Shared his thoughts on \"bold, purposeful leadership\" on a podcast with the NBA's Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr and CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson.Delivered a keynote speech at the South Carolina Democratic Blue Palmetto Dinner.Attended a fish fry hosted by Congressman Jim Clyburn who is widely credited for a Joe Biden 2020 primary campaign resurgence when that campaign was stalled.Met with former political advisers to Barack Obama and Joe Biden to discuss a presidential path to the White House through South Carolina.Spoke to hundreds of political insiders in South Carolina about his personal biography and on his record as Maryland governor.Spoke at an NAACP \"Fight for Freedom\" dinner in Detroit, Michigan.Spoke at the Virginia Democratic Party's Blue Commonwealth Gala.Will attend The Sun Valley Conference in Idaho sponsored by private investment firm Allen & Company, which is branded by Fortune magazine as an annual \"billionaire summer camp,\" that brings together business executives, social media titans, traditional news figures and elected officials who aspire to become president.\nUltimately, all this travel and schmoozing by Moore may be for naught.\nNext year, Moore must win a Democratic primary election and a general election in Maryland.\nConventional wisdom that he will win both is far from a given.\nIn polling done earlier this year, Moore's job performance approval fell to 55% from 61% from polling done in the prior month.\nThese poll results occurred before Moore signed into law a wide range of tax increases, new taxes, fee increases and new fees that were approved in the 2025 general assembly session.\nAs I write this, Moore has an opponent in the 2026 Democratic primary and three potential opponents seeking a gubernatorial nomination in the 2026 Republican primary. He will have a Green Party candidate in the 2026 general election.\nIn the Democratic and Republican primaries there may be more candidates deciding to run.\nOne wild card in the Republican primary is former Governor Hogan.\nDespite his failed U.S. Senate run, a survey done after Hogan's two terms as governor, showed he had a 77% job approval rating that included an 81% approval rating with Democratic voters.\nHogan has not yet announced his decision on seeking a third term which the state constitution allows since it would not be a third successive term.\nAssuming Moore is the successful Democratic candidate for governor, there is also the hard political reality that not meeting expected vote totals in elections that any candidate is expected to win can be an insurmountable roadblock on a journey to the White House.\nPreeminent Maryland political analyst Len Foxwell has observed: \"What we have seen in the past where prospective gubernatorial candidates and prospective presidential candidates have been derailed because of weaker than expected showings back home.\"\nRegardless of who is elected Maryland governor in 2026, voters in that election cycle and every election cycle in Maryland would be best served if there was no longer a regular mismatch between what some candidates of every party affiliation do and what they say. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Fate of Talbot's short-term rental proposals still up in the air\n\n July 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 728\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The future of short-term rental legislation in Talbot County remains uncertain as the county's planning commission and elected officials have yet to find a middle ground.In an ongoing debate since May, Talbot County Council members Lynn Mielke and Pete Lesher are aiming to further regulate short-term rental properties in the county. But agents, owners and now county planners have indicated opposition to the proposals.\nAt its July 2 meeting, the Talbot County Planning Commission reviewed draft legislation line-by-line. Commission members delivered mixed thoughts on some of the rules, but for the most part, they provided negative reviews on changes they described as \"onerous\" and unnecessary.\nAnd on a couple specifics, they discussed relaxing requirements instead of increasing them.\nIn an interview Tuesday, Mielke said it's clear the commission is \"100% on the side of short-term rentals.\"\n\"Anybody who is affected negatively by short-term rentals doesn't have a voice,\" she said. \"And those who are profiting from short-term rentals control.\"\nThe Planning Commission left written comment open on July 2, and it's unclear exactly when that body's amended version of the legislation will be officially sent to the council.\nThe commission's recommendation is likely to gut a number of the proposed regulations; however, the commission is only a recommending body in the matter, leaving the County Council with final say.\nPROPOSED RULES\nProponents of the legislation, such as Mielke and some county residents, argue a proliferation of short-term rentals is hurting local communities, especially village zones. Opponents say the number of rentals hasn't significantly increased in the last few years and that changes aren't needed given a lack of formal complaints from neighbors.\nAs currently set up, property owners obtain short-term rental licenses from a review board. Once an initial license is approved, they must obtain renewal from the board one year later, then every two years.\nSome of the new proposed restrictions include mandatory landlines, more detailed stay logs for license renewals, a seven-night minimum stay for lease holders in residential and village districts, and a split of licenses into two classes based on if the property is the applicant's primary residence.\nAs drafted, properties that aren't the applicant's primary residence would face new license limits: one license per 500 or 1,000 feet, depending on the zoning district.\nCommission member Paul Spies said the class split is a \"hard sell.\"\n\"I think the law as it is is fine,\" he said. \"Two licenses, to me, doesn't make sense.\"\n\"It seems onerous on staff,\" Commission Chair James Corson said.\nFor renewal applicants, the proposed legislation lays out new logging requirements. Property owners would need to submit specific stay logs, including when the property was occupied by the owner or family members.\n\"I think that's a little bit too much of an overreach,\" Chip Councell said.\nMielke said the concerns around how much work will be put on staff and what would be asked of rental owners aren't totally valid. She said wording for the draft regulations was derived from Prince George's County.\n\"It had a basis,\" Mielke said, adding that for tax purposes, rental owners should already be documenting information that the new proposals would ask for.\nThe commission at times voiced that Talbot County's current short-term rental rules could be relaxed. Commission members said the council should make rental licenses transferable. Currently, new applications must be submitted if ownership of a property is transferred.\n\"The use hasn't changed. Zoning follows a land, it does not follow the owner,\" Councell said. \"So it would seem to me that there would be a way that makes sense.\n\"I would say that a short-term rental license should be transferable\" with conditions, he added.\nLesher and Mielke disagree.\n\"That's something that I don't support,\" Lesher said in an interview. \"I think that who is running one of these matters, and that should not be automatic in the transfer and renewal.\"\nLesher said the council does pay attention to the commission's recommendation, and that with positive reviews of some smaller aspects of the proposals, there will be an update to the code no matter where some of the more major pieces land.\n\"I do think that something should pass here,\" Lesher said.\nIt's still unclear whether Mielke and Lesher's proposals will garner majority support from the council. Dave Stepp and Keasha Haythe both said they are waiting for the commission's official recommendation and further discussion.\nCouncil President Chuck Callahan says he hopes to take the recommendations into account while coming \"to a compromise\" with all council members. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now, a new town manager, a recently elected commissioner and highly invested residents are taking it upon themselves to assess where the project stands.At Tuesday evening's meeting, Oxford commissioner Dave Donovan used his time during the commissioner comment period to say, \"I'd hate for a meeting to go by and not talk about the Strand.\"\nResidents sat up a bit straighter and were excited to hear this.\nRecently, protective fencing was erected all over the Strand Beach.\n\"I mean, my god, what an eyesore,\" Donovan said.\nIn order for the town to be in compliance with the Maryland Department of Environment, 85% of the Strand must be covered by marsh and vegetation — as seen from an aerial view — for five years.\nThe protective fencing, which signifies where the marsh and vegetation will go, covers a large portion of the former beach area.\n\"I think that's a huge change for people to accept because those used to be beach areas,\" Commission President Katrina Greer said.\nDonovan asked if it would be expensive to take the fencing down, and Greer said it would. \"It's $25,000, believe it or not,\" she said.\nThe fencing will potentially be up for seasons, but commissioners said they hope that will not be the case. Greer said the fencing helps the plants take hold and without it, they could be installing thousands of plants each year.\n\"It's the project that keeps giving,\" Greer said, sarcastically.\nThe town has been urging the Strand Project's contractor, Underwood and Associates, to complete the living shoreline for several months. On Tuesday, commissioners discussed changing contractors from Underwood and Associates, which the town still has the power to do at this stage of the project.\nDuring the open comments period, resident Jan Greenhawk suggested that the town sue Underwood and Associates.\n\"I'm going to be short and sweet. I know you're going to closed session and you're going to talk about legal issues,\" Greenhawk said. \"I'm going to give you an opinion, and I think a lot of people in town might agree with this: We need to seek legal action against this contractor. I think he pulled a fast one on the town of Oxford.\"\nUnderwood and Associates was unable to comment on the situation before The Star Democrat's deadline.\nCurrently, there is no ADA accessibility at the Strand Beach and the little walking room there is on the street is consumed by an 80-inch standing puddle.\n\"(The standing water) has been an outstanding problem for this project for years, and years and years,\" Donovan said.\nThere will be an update on the Strand's stormwater issues at the next meeting, which will take place Aug. 12 at 6 p.m. at 101 Market Street. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From crushes to banning cell phones — Maryland lawmakers propose new legislation covering range of issues\n\n February 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 636\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS – Maryland state senators and delegates have introduced a variety of bills in the 2024 legislative session, addressing issues ranging from state symbols and education mandates to law enforcement policy and budget concerns.State Symbols and Utility Regulations\nState Sen. Steve Hershey (R-36) has introduced Senate Bill 562, which would designate the original Maryland Orange Crush as the state cocktail. The bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Johnny Mautz (R-37) and Mary Beth Carozza (R-38).\nHershey also sponsored Senate Bill 561, which, along with House Bill 227 sponsored by Del. Chris Adams (R-37B), would allow electric cooperatives to use unclaimed funds only to assist cooperative members or donate to nonprofit organizations, rather than treating them as abandoned property.\nAdditionally, Hershey introduced Senate Bill 355, seeking to delay the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program by two years.\nEnergy and Education Legislation\nDel. Jeff Ghrist (R-36) is behind two bills on solar energy regulation: House Bill 739 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 478) and House Bill 742. One bill would prohibit the use of eminent domain for solar siting, while the other would return control over solar development to county governments.\nGhrist also introduced House Bill 736, which seeks to remove the mandate requiring local school systems to offer pre-kindergarten for three-year-olds. Another provision in the bill would increase state funding to help Kent County construct a new middle school.\nOn law enforcement, Ghrist is supporting a bill — potentially House Bill 122 — that would require the removal of unfounded complaints from police personnel files.\nNursing, Historic Preservation, and Cemetery Protections\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-37B) has proposed House Bill 602 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 407), directing the State Board of Nursing to negotiate reciprocity agreements with neighboring states for advanced practice nursing licensure. Another measure, House Bill 616 (cross-filed as Senate Bill 421), would extend the statute of limitations for crimes related to cemetery destruction and prohibit damaging cemetery landscaping. The bill is co-sponsored by Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-37A).\nHutchinson is also behind House Bill 760, which would establish a local appeals process for Maryland Historic Trust decisions.\nBudget Deficit Shifts to Counties\nGov. Wes Moore's proposed budget shifts some of the state's structural deficit onto county governments. Del. Jeff Ghrist (R-36) criticized the move, stating that counties did not contribute to the deficit but are now being forced to compensate for state overspending.\n\"For my district, $720,000 will be shifted to Caroline County on top of an additional $1.8 million more that the county will have to add to education under Kirwan mandates,\" Ghrist stated. He cited similar financial burdens for other Eastern Shore counties, including Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne's.\n\"This will stifle economic growth because people will be sending more of their hard-earned money to the government rather than spending it in their local economies,\" Ghrist added.\nLaw Enforcement and Traffic Stop Restrictions\nA controversial proposal, Senate Bill 292, has drawn strong opposition from law enforcement officials, including Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker. The bill would reclassify certain primary traffic offenses as secondary offenses, preventing law enforcement from stopping drivers solely for those violations.\n\"These minor traffic violations could actually lead to catching suspects that have committed serious felonies, recovering firearms, and stopping drug-related crimes,\" Baker said. A hearing on the bill is scheduled before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee.\nOther Bills of Local Interest\nHouse Bill 28, sponsored by Del. Josh Bouchat (R-5), proposes a constitutional amendment requiring all Maryland counties to adopt a charter government structure.\nHouse Bill 278, also from Bouchat, would provide an income tax subtraction modification for enhanced agricultural management equipment to support sustainable farming practices.\nHouse Bill 192, introduced by Del. Nino Mangione (R-42A), aims to curb student cell phone use in schools under the proposed \"No Distracted Learning Act.\"\nAs these bills move through the legislature, local officials and residents will have the opportunity to voice their support or concerns during committee hearings and public forums. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "'Only going to get worse': Talbot officials discuss rise in senior homelessness",

    "content": "'Only going to get worse': Talbot officials discuss rise in senior homelessness\n\n July 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: News \n \n 648\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot County officials and senior care leaders met Tuesday to discuss creating a task force to address senior homelessness, a rapidly accelerating problem, experts say.The request for the task force comes from Talbot County Council member Lynn Mielke. Based on council feedback, a resolution to create the task force seems poised for approval at the council's Aug. 12 meeting.\nMembers of the county's Commission on Aging and other health and housing experts spoke on mounting challenges faced by area seniors, from housing costs and food insecurity to mental health struggles.\nRachel Smith, chair of the aging commission, said a task force would help align local nonprofits, county boards and the health department. There's currently a \"disconnect,\" she said.\n\"There isn't anybody who is behind all of these organizations pushing to keep everybody connected,\" Smith said. \"And that's what we found is one of the biggest problems. We have all these organizations out here that are doing so much great work, but then we've got to figure out a way to connect so we can help all these people.\"\nMielke said there's no single solution to help the homeless senior population.\n\"Each agency would bring solutions or suggestions, but not one agency can deal with all of the issues,\" Mielke said.\nAs drafted, the senior citizens task force would consist of representatives from the following entities: Commission on Aging, Delmarva Community Services, Talbot Interfaith Shelter, Neighborhood Service Center, Talbot County Health Department, Easton Town Council and County Council. Members from Mid-Shore Behavioral Health and law enforcement agencies may also be added based on Tuesday's discussions.\nThe task force would make recommendations to the County Council on housing, transportation and meal services for homeless seniors.\nHomelessness is growing\nJulie Lowe, executive director of Talbot Interfaith Shelter, cited jumps in calls from seniors as evidence that homelessness is on the rise.\nIn 2023, the shelter received 15 calls from men 55 and older and 14 calls from women 55 and older. One year later, those marks increased to 30 and 23, respectively.\nThis year, the Easton-based shelter has already received 19 calls from men and 13 calls from women in that age range.\nTalbot Interfaith has limited capacity, Lowe said. It runs a multi-year program to transition people into paying for partial rent before moving out on their own. But even when shelter residents move out, Lowe said finding a financially viable apartment in the area isn't an easy task, especially for seniors who can't work.\n\"Most of the people who we work with will never get to that point with the market-rate housing and where it is now,\" Lowe said.\nLee Newcomb, a Talbot County social worker for 26 years and the aging commission's secretary, said she's never seen senior need at such a high level.\nNewcomb said the Days Inn in Easton is home to many unhoused individuals. Smith said seniors especially suffer in the winter months since Talbot County doesn't have a low-barrier homeless shelter.\nSmith noted an incident at the Days Inn last December as a wake-up call. According to police, an unhoused man who was living in the woods behind the hotel was found dead on Dec. 14, 2024.\n\"I feel like we missed something there,\" Smith said. \"We shouldn't have our senior residents — some of them have worked in our community — die.\"\nCambridge-based Delmarva Community Services has served many homeless people from Talbot County down in Dorchester, according to president and CEO Andy Hollis.\nHollis said a low-barrier, overnight shelter is a gap in Talbot County, and something that a task force could work on. Many others at the meeting on Tuesday emphasized the need for a physical location to consolidate services for the senior homeless population.\n'We don't have this issue in Talbot,' we thought for so long,\" Hollis said. \"And we truly do. It's something that is long overdue in terms of being addressed.\"\n\"The challenge is not leveling out and it's only going to get worse,\" he added. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot's cannabis regulations draw mixed reviews from residents, operators\n\n August 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: News \n \n 678\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CORDOVA — Debate over how strict Talbot County should be on cannabis operations has peaked in recent weeks, especially among Cordova residents.Last month, the county began to consider draft cannabis legislation focused on growing and processing operations. As originally written, such businesses would be barred from locating within 500 feet of residential properties.\nTwo Talbot County residents who were awarded state licenses for cannabis operations spoke out against strict \"no odor\" requirements and the 500-foot mark in the draft rules. They asked the council to consider dropping the residential setback to 200 feet as they look to acquire property to locate their cannabis businesses, potentially in Cordova.\nMany residents disagree.\n\"We knew we were going to have agricultural smells,\" Cordova resident Donna Albright said in an interview. \"We were not expecting the continuous odor of marijuana.\"\nAlbright and others have lobbied the Talbot County Council to reject the 200-foot setback and keep the \"no odor\" requirement as initially drafted. Albright said at a county meeting last month that around 150 residents signed onto a petition against any amendments relaxing the setback.\nSome have objected to cannabis operations as a whole.\n\"I have grandchildren that come over, and I would like them to not have to look at this,\" Cordova resident Perry Davidson said at a July 22 meeting. \"So I would ask you not to let something like this happen in Talbot County. It's just not a great idea.\"\nRecreational cannabis use was legalized in 2023 in Maryland. Talbot County's legislation comes as neighboring jurisdictions have enacted regulations on growing and processing operations. The County Council is eligible to vote on the cannabis legislation at its Aug. 12 meeting.\nDiscussion on cannabis among Cordova residents largely began online and at county meetings after a cultivation license holder, Lori Yates, said at a July 8 meeting that she was potentially working on acquiring the Triple Creek Winery property.\nThe winery, now closed, is located on Three Bridge Branch Road in Cordova. An owner of the property did not respond to a request for comment.\nYates said in an email Thursday that her entity, Hanson Street Partners LLC, prefers to locate somewhere in Talbot County and plans to acquire property by the end of the year.\nShe wrote that a 500-foot setback is \"quite burdensome,\" citing the fact that other jurisdictions use 200-foot marks for cannabis operations.\nYates says her motivation to open a cannabis site comes from her experience as a cancer survivor. She pointed out cannabis' use by cancer patients.\n\"Recreational use has gained increasing cultural acceptance and has shown itself to be less dangerous than alcohol consumption,\" Yates wrote.\nFor the residents opposed, the location of Chapel District Elementary School in comparison to the winery raised qualms. Albright also shared worries about groundwater contamination due to high water use.\nAlbright said she's not against cannabis use, but that \"our biggest thing is about processing in our front yard.\" Speaking to the County Council last month, Albright asked that the county keep the \"no odor\" language.\n\"We are deathly opposed to the continuous odor,\" she said.\nZac Hopkins, co-founder of Lady Grace LLC, the county's other license holder for processing, said he's reviewed more than 10 potential sites in Talbot County.\n\"Unfortunately, if the current draft cannabis legislation is enacted as written, every one of these properties would be deemed noncompliant; effectively preventing the production of this Maryland state-certified agricultural product within our county,\" Hopkins wrote in an email.\nWhile over 100 people signed onto the petition against reducing the setback, some Cordova residents have expressed their support for vetted cannabis operations.\n\"I know that these facilities are run clean,\" longtime Cordova resident Sylvia Carroll said in an interview. \"They don't destroy the environment.\"\nCarroll acknowledged that \"the further away from a residence, the better.\" But she added that she sees much of the opposition coming from misunderstandings about the prospective operations.\n\"I've lived through the chicken factory and I've lived through the manure spreading and chicken houses being emptied,\" Carroll said. \"I think people just aren't really informed as to what it is. I think they think they're just going to be selling drugs out the back door.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The council did not vote on the matter, but they indicated they planned to sign an agreement for one year of policing services.\nAccording to council member Brandy James, all Federalsburg Police Department staff will move to the Caroline County Sheriff's Office when the agreement is signed. The Sheriff's Office will use the current Federalsburg Police Department as a substation.\nThe decision comes as the town tries to tackle $5 million in debt.\nJames said the police department takes up half of the town's budget. At Federalsburg Public Forum on July 21, council member Ian Furgerson said if the town were to sign an MOU with the Sheriff's Office, it would save the town between $300,000 and $500,000 per year.\nMultiple items in the MOU are still being discussed, but the current draft includes five deputies to be assigned to the town. Town Attorney Lyndsey Ryan made it clear to the public the MOU is still a work-in-progress, and the number of officers has not been confirmed.\n\"I also want to add that while there's been discussions about the number of officers to include in an MOU, there will be an MOU once it's kind of ironed out and reviewed and everything on a Federalsburg agenda, and there will be a public hearing on it,\" Ryan said.\n\"The decision has not been made as of now. I think that's the direction that they're going, but there still will be an actual agreement on an agenda for a public comment and a vote.\"\nJames said this is the best decision for the town and the officers.\n\"It actually giving these officers what they so much needed, which is increase in salary,\" James said. \"They get access to le-ops, they get more than what we as a town can provide to them. Police and is very competitive, and Federalsburg is one of the lowest paid agencies. So we felt as we wanted to give this MOU situation a try for a year, and throughout that year we want to have quarterly meetings with the public.\"\nThe MOU will have a public hearing at a future Federalsburg Town Council meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton Town Council speaks out on increased ICE activity\n\n August 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 727\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Councilmember David Montgomery led the prayer at Monday's Easton Town Council Meeting, during which he asked for God to watch over Pastor Daniel Fuentes Espinal.This was the first of many mentions of Espinal, who has been detained by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement since July 21.\n\"We pray especially for Daniel Fuentes Espinal. Watch over him during his trials, and return him to his family, if that is your will,\" Montgomery said.\nEspinal came to Easton in 2001 on a six-month visa. He has been pastor of Iglesia del Nazareno Jesús Te Ama since 2015.\nEspinal was detained by two ICE agents in Easton and taken to ICE's Salisbury Field Office on July 21, according to his daughter.\nHe was quickly transferred to the Baltimore ICE detention center, where he remained for three nights. That Thursday, Espinal was transferred to an ICE detention center in Louisiana, where he will stay until his hearing, which has not been scheduled yet.\nThe comments at Monday's meeting came amid increased ICE presence in the town.\n\"ICE was here today and made some arrests. I mean, it seems like they're here more often than ever,\" Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis said.\nMichele Dappert, president of the Talbot County Democratic Forum, said the forum learned of what she believes could be dozens of immigration arrests early this week through both word-of-mouth and corroborating photos and videos. An exact number could not be provided.\nThe Rev. John Nash from Sts. Peter and Paul said one member of the church's Spanish-speaking congregation was \"abducted\" Tuesday.\n\"She was abducted some time this morning, and she's not permitted to call anyone, so nobody knows where she is,\" Nash said. \"They're going after these poor innocent folks who are just trying to make a living.\"\nEaston Police Capt. Greg Wright confirmed that the department was aware of ICE activity in the town on Monday, though the department was not involved in any arrests and could not provide specific details.\nEaston resident Emily Stone, who spoke to the council Monday, wanted to know if the police department has a formal agreement with ICE and if the Town Council had taken any actions to get Espinal home.\n\"I, in particular, want to learn more about how the arrest of Rev. Espinal is being handled by the Town Council and if you have made any requests to our state representative, Andy Harris, to learn more about his well-being or his location,\" Stone said.\nWright responded, saying the police department has no interaction with ICE nor does it have a formal agreement. They usually are not notified about ICE operations or apprehensions in Easton because ICE is a federal program.\nWhile the town has taken no formal actions on behalf of Espinal, every council member used a portion of their comment period Monday to speak about the effects of the recent ICE arrests on the community.\nCouncilmember Maureen Curry said she is \"distraught\" over the detention of Espinal as the daughter of an immigrant herself.\n\"We are a nation of immigrants, and in my opinion, and it is just my opinion, this administration has turned their backs on the hardworking, honest people like my father that came to this country to make a better life for themselves and their families,\" Curry said. \"Pastor Espinal has been a pillar of our community for nearly 24 years, and his family and his congregation are devastated by his detention.\"\nCouncil President Don Abbatiello ended the meeting by encouraging concerned residents to reach out to Congressman Andy Harris (R-Md.) and Sens. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).\n\"There is ultimately something wrong with a system where Pastor Espinal and other residents are picked up for what amounts to misdemeanors in civil violations and placed in holding cells far from their loved ones,\" Abbatiello said. \"The way the law is written and enforced right now, this is what happens.\"\nIn a statement to The Star Democrat Tuesday evening, Harris said he is \"aware of the case and believe(s) it's important to fully understand the details before drawing conclusions.\"\n\"We are trying to determine what leeway the Secretary of Homeland Security has in granting exceptions to deportation orders,\" Harris said. \"That said, the Trump administration has been clear: individuals who are in the country illegally should self-deport and follow the proper, legal process to return.\"\nReporter Konner Mets contributed to this article.\nThis report has been updated to include comment from Rep. Andy Harris. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Move-in date for Doverbrook Apartments uncertain due to snag with HUD\n\n August 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 614\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Doverbrook Apartments, rebuilt and seemingly ready to welcome in residents, have spent all summer empty due to a snag between the Housing Commission of Talbot and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.Run by the housing commission, the 64-unit, voucher-based complex celebrated a renovation this spring, adding 14 apartments to accommodate more low-income tenants. It opened its doors to town, county and state officials for tours upon completion.\nBut move-in for residents has been delayed since May.\nEaston Town Council members expressed concerns earlier this month about the delay, pointing out how it has and will continue to create confusion for residents.\n\"You're gonna have a lot of people who ride by those buildings, and say, 'What in the world is going on?'\" said Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis, whose ward includes Doverbrook, at an Aug. 4 town meeting.\nDon Bibb, the Housing Commission's executive director, fielded questions from the council on the matter.\nBibb said the mounting holdups stem from HUD's requirement that the complex's housing choice voucher plan undergo a 45-day public comment period and be advertised in a newspaper. The plan, available for public review in Easton's town office, outlines the complex's occupancy guidelines and priority and waitlist rules, among other things.\nBibb said the commission made slight changes to the plan, such as clarifying which residents are given priority. HUD determined the changes necessitated a reset of the 45-day comment period.\n\"We dispute that point,\" Bibb said at the Aug. 4 meeting. He said a waiver request has been submitted to the federal agency.\nHUD did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\nThe apartments were closed in December 2023 for renovation. Returning residents, who have been temporarily housed by the commission in St. Michaels, will have priority. In April, 145 people applied to be put on the Doverbrook waitlist, Bibb said last week.\nDavis said in an interview Tuesday that the situation is a \"sad state of affairs.\"\nThe council member has spoken to residents who have sent in applications, and he said their excitement to move into the new apartments has dwindled with the significant delay.\nResidents must meet income standards and qualify for the housing vouchers to have their applications approved for the voucher-based complex. Davis is concerned the holdup could put some at a disadvantage.\n\"What if a person was good in May and may not be good in August or September?\" Davis said. \"They won't be able to get an apartment, and I don't think that's fair.\"\nBibb said in an interview last month that rumors spurred by the delay, such as site contractors not getting paid, are false.\nAmid swirling speculation, Bibb said the commission would like to get the ball rolling, but he maintained that the commission would continue to honor HUD's needs.\n\"We're losing revenue. That's not a good thing,\" Bibb said on July 25. \"But it is what it is. Compliance with federal government is a critical point for any type of project like this.\"\nAt the time, Bibb said the hope was for most of the units to be occupied by the end of August. But at last week's Town Council meeting, it seemed that target would be moving back.\nBibb told the council that if the waiver request isn't approved, the updated housing choice voucher plan for Doverbrook Apartments was set to go live Aug. 7. That would make Sept. 21 or 22 the worst-case scenario dates for move-in to begin, he said.\nDavis said he hopes such delays can be prevented in the future. He acknowledged that the renovated apartments themselves are impressive.\n\"I think (last week's) discussion brought a lot of enlightenment,\" Davis said on Tuesday. \" ... There were still a lot of questions that were left on the table.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Talbot County planners have worked nearly a year on drafting a cannabis processing and growing bill, outlining rules on setbacks from homes, odor mitigation and more.\nOn Tuesday, council members voted down two proposed amendments to the cannabis bill and, eventually, the bill itself. Opposition from council President Chuck Callahan and member Lynn Mielke, along with abstentions from Keasha Haythe (and, in one instance, Dave Stepp), combined to defeat the legislation. Vice President Pete Lesher and Stepp supported the amendments, while Lesher was the sole yes vote on the unamended bill.\nLesher told The Star Democrat that he didn't expect the bill to fail. He believes without it, the county in a tricky spot.\n\"I think we find ourselves in an interesting position figuring out what the course forward is on regulating cannabis,\" Lesher said during the meeting. \"The state has told us that we must do so, and we now don't have a plan.\"\nAs drafted, the legislation would have required processors and growers to locate at least 500 feet away from residential lots, mitigate cannabis odors so nothing is \"detectible from adjacent properties\" and obtain site plan approval from the county.\nMultiple state cannabis license holders had advocated for a reduced setback and lessened odor mitigation requirements, citing that they may not be able to successfully open in Talbot County without those changes. But those edits didn't appear in legislation on the table Tuesday.\nStepp offered an amendment to harden the 500-foot setback so it couldn't be reduced by way of an agreement between affected neighbors, though that failed with only Lesher's support.\nLesher offered an amendment to make permits for processors available only through special exception, as well as increase minimum lot size for growers and processors from 20 to 40 acres. Those changes were recommended by the county's Planning Commission, but only Stepp joined the vice president in supporting them.\nCouncil members who voted no on the legislation cited varying reasons.\nHaythe said in an interview after the meeting that she needs more information and has concerns about the effects of odor on children.\n\"We're gonna have to go back to the drawing board and come up with something,\" Haythe said. On Wednesday, Haythe said she's working with council and County Attorney Patrick Thomas on drafting a new bill.\nIn an interview, Stepp said there were \"too many moving parts\" with the legislation for it to pass. The residential setback should be closer to 1,000 feet, he said.\n\"I feel like it wasn't the best product that we could've put forward yet,\" Stepp said. While he still has \"a hard time believing\" recreational cannabis passed statewide, he acknowledged the county is in a position where it must create some sort of local zoning law.\nMany residents have weighed in on the legislation. The matter gained traction in Cordova after a license holder said she was in talks to buy the now-closed Triple Creek Winery. Property owners haven't confirmed or denied if that's still a consideration.\nSome residents raised worries that a cannabis business could locate too close to Chapel District Elementary School. Haythe echoed that sentiment.\n\"Children are a huge concern as it relates to the odor that's smelled, the air that's breathed in the areas where the growing and processing will be done,\" she said. \"We just don't want that to affect the children at that school.\"\nCallahan wrote to The Star Democrat that his concern is land value. \"The community doesn't want this,\" he wrote on Wednesday.\nWHAT'S NEXT\nIt's unclear exactly how soon legislation may return to the council's desk. Any significant changes may necessitate a return to the Planning Commission and potentially a council-commission work session. The council already met with commission members in September to draft the now-failed bill.\nIn the meantime, the county will operate without clear zoning on cannabis processing and growing facilities. At Tuesday's meeting, Lesher asked how staff will deal with potential permit applications from cannabis license holders looking to locate in Talbot County.\nBryce Yelton said he believes the county \"might have to hold it\" based on the fact that zoning legislation is under consideration. He deferred to Thomas, the county attorney, for a firmer answer.\nThomas said state law requires cannabis operations to comply with local zoning. Prospective cannabis operators may not be able to make progress in this current limbo period, he said.\n\"If the county were to take the position that cannabis does not fall under existing agricultural use, then it wouldn't be permitted as such under the zoning code,\" Thomas said. \"So without this (bill), they wouldn't be able to go forward under that position.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton task force narrows list of recommended housing solutions\n\n August 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 650\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — An 18-member group tasked with identifying solutions to address the Easton's affordable housing stock is honing in on which specific recommendations to send to Town Council.Last Thursday, 11 members of the Attainable Housing Task Force met to review a draft version of the task force's final report prepared by Miguel Salinas, the town's planning and zoning director.\nThey agreed on five main recommendations, which will be spelled out in an edited version of the draft and eventually presented to the Town Council at a joint workshop. Those recommendations include:\nZoning reform suggestions including removing limits for \"missing middle\" units such as townhomes, increasing maximum densities for some residential districts and adjusting dimensional standards and lot size requirements.A public-private partnership with a housing organization to build an affordable housing project on public land. Potential sites to include the old Talbot County Health Department and vacant county land near Magnolia Drive.Community education to help residents better understand the affordable housing issue.Make some fee exemptions for developers. A main recommendation is to create a Payment in Lieu of Taxes, or PILOT, program, which could provide a property tax break to developers building affordable units.Inclusionary zoning.\nMany at the meeting said the task force's job is to lay out potential solutions to improve Easton's affordable housing conundrum. There is no \"silver bullet\" fix, said task force co-chair Michael Ports, also a member of the Planning Commission.\n\"These are all just little pieces to the puzzle,\" said Susie Hayward, director of government affairs for Mid-Shore Board of Realtors. \"Not one area is gonna solve the problem. These are all just pieces to make it better.\"\nDEBATE\nWard 3 Councilmember David Montgomery — who serves on the task force alongside Ward 2's Robert Rankin — raised most of the concerns on the recommendations.\nMontgomery said the community outreach recommendation went out of bounds for town government duties. He asked for a \"more neutral tone.\" The draft report indicated that the Town Council should consider a housing webpage and a \"media initative to 'put a face' to the housing crisis.\"\n\"The part that I could never, ever support on this is a media campaign to provide a human face\" to the issue of affordable housing, Montgomery said. \" … I just don't think that's the role of government.\"\nOthers responded that it's needed to educate people on what exactly affordable housing is.\n\"It's important to define it for people to understand it because nobody does,\" task force member and realtor Jim Bent said.\nHayward added that people need to understand that affordable housing matters for \"the survival of our businesses.\"\n\"They're surviving now without them,\" Montgomery responded. Hayward disagreed, citing a Talbot County Chamber of Commerce survey of business owners where they expressed concerns that \"employees are tentative when they're living in other counties,\" she said.\nAt one point, Montgomery said the task force didn't have the proper time \"to discuss the pros and cons\" of the recommendations. It met 10 times in 2024, though draft recommendations weren't specifically discussed until the final five meetings.\nRankin suggested that when editing the report, Salinas include drawbacks to the recommendations. Ports said the pros and cons aspect was already written especially well by Salinas in the section recommending inclusionary zoning, which Ports believed \"strengthened\" the argument for inclusionary zoning.\nInclusionary zoning was a hot topic during the town's last election. A draft town ordinance requiring residential developers to allocate 15% of their units as affordable stalled out this winter.\nMontgomery, a vocal opponent of the measure, said at the task force meeting that the body's recommendation should be less focused on the old draft ordinance and take a more general stance on inclusionary zoning.\nEven if passed, Montgomery said, inclusionary zoning wouldn't immediately bring affordable housing units to Easton.\n\"That's right, that's why we should've passed it three years ago,\" Hayward responded. \"That's why we gotta pass it today, for all the developments that are coming up in the next five years, 10 years.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — Dog park discussion continue in St. Michaels.At the Wednesday Commissioners of St. Michaels meeting, the commissioners announced that there will be special sessions in the future to discuss all things dog park and to pick a location that makes sense for all residents of the town.\nWhile determining the master plan for San Domingo Creek Park construction, discussion arose about a dog park being included in the master plan. The commissioners decided not to include a dog park in the plan.\nOne of the reasons brought forward at the meeting Wednesday was that if dog park plans were added to the master plan, the grant received from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources could be pulled back.\n\"We have to identify what works best for the dog park, what works best for all stakeholders,\" Commissioners President Jay Hudson said. \"So we have to take into accounts our DNR obligations and trying to find the best place that works. It's going to be community input, and that's really going to be what drives where it goes.\"\nResidents voiced their opinions about where the dog park should or shouldn't be located.\nThe commissioners want to take into account multiple factors when decided the location of the dog park, including cost of building and maintenance, liability concerns, who is allowed to use the park and the less amount of people affected by the noise and traffic.\nTown Manager Don Richardson, who started in the position earlier this year, has experience with creating a dog park in Easton.\n\"So I think we are actually a lot better off having somebody who has that experience and is able to ask the questions that we don't really know to ask quite yet,\" Hudson said.\nWhile no date has been set, the commissioners will announce the dates for the special sessions about the potential dog park. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton's food truck rules come under scrutiny\n\n August 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 677\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Residents and food truck owners are speaking out against Easton's rules on food trucks as the town has begun enforcing restrictions more closely.Trisha Wright and Daniel Reyes, owners of the Korean BBQ food truck T & D Fusions, say they had been setting up next to places like the Shore Medical Center and Kohl's before the crackdown this month.\nWright organized an online petition this week for the town to reconsider its limits on food trucks. As of Friday, it received over 3,000 signatures and widespread attention on social media.\n\"I just feel like we're being shafted because we're mobile,\" Wright said.\nAn ordinance on food trucks has been in effect since 2011. It states that mobile food businesses must operate in conjunction with an approved temporary use, such as a permitted festival or parade. Other town rules include:\nFood trucks can operate on property owned by the food truck establishment itself, said Town Council President Don Abbatiello in an interview.Food trucks serving crews at active construction sites are exempt, per the 2011 ordinance.Food trucks can acquire a \"transient business\" license, per the\ntown charter\n. Fees for the first two days are $500 each, and $150 for each day after up to a maximum 30 days.\nDiscourse online has especially centered on food trucks that had been setting up during lunch hours outside the hospital.\nFood truck operators say they've heard from hospital employees who are upset the trucks are no longer there. Employees relied on them as an easy, accessible lunch option, said Mary Jo Flatten, owner of the lemonade bus Bravanson's Main Squeeze.\n\"They take care of us, so we should turn around and take care of them,\" Flatten said.\nShore Regional Health spokesperson Trena Williamson said in a statement the hospital complies with town zoning rules.\n\"We appreciate the interest from food truck vendors; the Town of Easton determines where they may operate and what zoning and permitting requirements they must follow,\" Williamson wrote.\nThe food truck debate is expected to come up at Monday's Town Council meeting. President Don Abbatiello said the council is considering both short- and long-term solutions.\n\"What we're gonna try to do is try to come up with something at the very least that would allow for food trucks to go back to the hospital area,\" Abbatiello said.\nFurther out, he believes there's a \"desire on the council to have a real conversation\" on the ordinance. Any major proposals will include ample time for public input, he said.\n\"We got to be fair to the restaurants and businesses that actually employ the folks that live here in town and pay taxes to help support town initiatives,\" Abbatiello said.\nAbbatiello said he's unsure of exactly how consistently the town has enforced the 2011 ordinance. This summer, a restaurant raised the concern of food trucks operating in town limits, Abbatiello said. Town leaders declined to name the restaurant.\nThe recent enforcement has followed the \"ordinance as it is written,\" Abbatiello said.\nWright said other areas have been more welcoming, such as Caroline County and Cambridge. But local food trucks are still pushing for change in Easton's regulations, she said.\n\"It does take effect on all of us, so we have to become one,\" Wright said. \"We have to become stronger together.\"\nAs council members prepare to discuss the matter on Monday and food truck supporters organize to come out to the meeting, one local business is stepping in to fill the void.\nKustomScapes & Pools owners Karen Glass and Jon Glass Sr. are scheduling a lineup of food trucks outside their business next week. The pool business sits off of Easton Parkway at the end of Route 662. Despite being surrounded by town land on all sides, the property itself is county land and not bound by Easton's food truck ordinance.\nKaren Glass said they wanted to pull together as a community after hearing about the food truck controversy. They have trucks slated for almost every day next week and a coffee truck every other Friday, she said.\n\"This is what our community was built on,\" Jon Glass said. \"The community supporting each other and small businesses supporting small businesses.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The solar grid is located in Pocomoke and Salisbury, Maryland. Residents would have to go online and enroll, once customers enroll, it would take two billing cycles before they would start to see that credit on their account. The town also signed a memorandum of understanding with Delmarva Power to provide the solar gird for residents.Greensboro Town Manager Cindy Yost reported on audits of Greensboro sewer billing and trash contracts, which revealed undercharging of apartment complexes. Water and sewer billing revealed flat-rate billing for some apartment complexes. Corrective actions were discussed, including ending trash service to underbilled apartment complexes. The town council members voted to pay for $24,000 in undercharges for the apartments complexes citing their mistakes for the reason.Yost reported on audits of phone accounts which showed the town paying for multiple inactive phone lines. The audit led to about $18,000-$20,000 in savings for the town.The town announced a switch to QuickBooks accounting software.GPS fleet tracking was implemented for town vehicles. The GPS tracking will allow the town to save money on gas and insurance.The council voted to letter two police vehicles at an expense of $910.An ordinance regarding weed/grass control and refuse/waste placement was introduced and will be presented at the next meeting.A memorandum of understanding with the Office of Administrative Hearings in Caroline County was approved. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Taking the podium at Canton Waterfront Park, he said his campaign would focus on public safety and education. His formal announcement came just three months after he informally declared his candidacy as a Democratic opponent to incumbent Gov. Wes Moore.\nHale, who formally announced his candidacy for the 2026 Maryland governor's race last week, has a complex resume.\nAccording to a 2015 article in the Wall Street Journal, Hale disclosed that he worked covertly for the Central Intelligence Agency for nearly a decade during the 1990s and early 2000s. He said he allowed the CIA to create a fictitious company under his corporate umbrella to be used as cover for field operatives, and claimed he spoke with a CIA handler between 30 and 50 times a year. Hale reported traveling to Saudi Arabia, Poland, Denmark and Norway, among other places, providing the agency with economic reports upon his return. He also said he was involved in a canceled operation in Georgia in 1998 concerning the purchase of ships for intelligence purposes and played a role in the CIA's early search for Osama bin Laden by facilitating covert agent deployments across Central Asia. Hale said his role with the CIA ended after the Sept. 11 attacks.\nIn addition to his intelligence work, Hale founded First Mariner Bancorp before stepping down from an operational role in 2011. He also owns property in Easton.\nHale's roots run deep in southeastern Baltimore City and Baltimore County. He was born and raised in Dundalk and, according to previous Eagle coverage, chipped in money to help restore the wrought iron gates at Dundalk's Battle Monument Park in 2014 after a resident stole the previous structure to sell for scrap.\nThe businessman is also responsible for the development of Canton Tower, the 17-story waterfront structure that kicked off a wave of retail and housing growth in the area during the 2000s and 2010s.\nWhile he has had a hand in Baltimore's development, Hale's pursuits extend beyond the city. He currently owns the Baltimore Blast soccer team.\nHis Republican candidacy, however, is already proving contentious.\nIn a press release published shortly after Hale's announcement, Maryland Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey voiced concerns about the businessman's sudden platform switch.\n\"Just because he may no longer feel comfortable associating with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party doesn't mean he now embraces the Republican Party's long-standing principles of limited government, fiscal responsibility, individual liberty, and strong public safety,\" Hershey said.\n\"We've built a Republican movement in Maryland that stands for more than just opposition to the far left — it stands for authentic leadership and a clear governing philosophy,\" he continued. \"Our voters expect more than opportunism — they expect commitment.\"\nOthers, like county council candidate Tim Fazenbaker, have aligned themselves with Hale. In a recent interview, Fazenbaker said that he and Hale, both natives of the greater Dundalk area, are planning a joint tour of Dundalk in the coming months.\nMitchell is an attorney and former chairman of the Board of Appeals at Maryland Department of Labor.\nEditor Hannah Combs contributed to this article. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It takes away any potential to have commercial development in that area.\nThe informal meetings were conducted by Paul Falcon and Kathryn Klvana at 13959 Still Pond Road and then at the Betterton Volunteer Firehouse, and drew out other neighbors who would be affected by building the installation.\nThe second meeting that took place at the firehouse was well-attended and included Mayor Donald Sutton, council member Gerry Werner, longtime residents and people passionate about this cause coming from other Maryland regions affected by these facilities.\nSutton said it is good to see so many people come out and express their concerns.\nResidents raised multiple objections to the proposed solar installation during the meetings.\nDouglas Cregar said his group has researched the project extensively and opposes the installation.\n\"We've done our research and are against this solar installation here,\" Cregar said. \"Studies show that everyone within a mile will lose 5% in property value. Also, among 35 active solar proposals in Maryland, there is no location like the Betterton area they plan to build on, that is surrounded by residential housing on three sides.\"\nArt Pleasanton raised concerns about emergency services, noting the proposed site would interfere with helicopter medical evacuations.\n\"If (solar) is built where they want to build it they'd have to do it over a helicopter landing zone,\" Pleasanton said. \"The next nearest one is at Worton at the school. For anyone who thinks this is not an issue, last year a little girl was saved from drowning because we had a way to get her out fast.\"\nKathryn Klvana expressed frustration with recent state legislation that could override local zoning decisions.\n\"I'm shocked that with this new law Governor Wes Moore just signed, the state can override local zoning and put this huge solar farm across from our homes,\" Klvana said. \"We moved to this beautiful place to retire. We're zoned community residential. What about our rights?\"\nTracy Cameransi, who lives in a small area just outside of town, said she frequently receives calls from solar companies but will not sell to them. She is opening her home for residents to attend the upcoming virtual hearing together.\n\"We have a small area just outside of town and we get calls all the time from these solar companies,\" Cameransi said. \"We will never sell to them, but what we are doing is opening up our home on Sept. 9 for the Zoom hearing and everyone is invited to attend at 13499 Still Pond Road.\"\nAs the town is preparing for a public hearing for the Halo project, a virtual meeting on Sept. 9 at 7 p.m. online, attendees gave their initial impressions concerning the project. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But after some discussion from town residents, rules regarding chickens could change.\nAccording to town staff, the conversation has been ongoing through the past couple of months, but it gained traction after residents began preparing petitions and presentations on chickens.\nMason Sparks, a resident of the town, gave a presentation to the town on chickens at the commissioners' August meeting. At Monday's meeting, Sparks said that he knocked on 471 doors and received 178 responses from residents, 87.6% of whom were in favor of allowing chickens.\nResident Andrew Meyer also spoke on Monday in favor of chickens being allowed within the town limits.\n\"I just want to start by saying that I strongly support allowing chickens in town,\" Meyer said. \"There's towns and cities all over the country that currently allow chickens. Today, more and more people want to know where the food's coming from, and raising backyard chickens for eggs is one way that people can ensure that they have healthy raised source of food.\"\nMeyer addressed some concerns he said he has heard about chickens.\n\"As far as noise, hens are no louder than barking dogs or children playing. As far smells, a small backyard coop that's kept clean would have minimal smell. It's no more disturbing than any other farm smells that town is currently surrounded by. I think the benefits outweigh any small disturbance that would cause to any neighbors around the town.\"\nAfter hearing from residents, the commissioners voiced their opinions.\n\"It seems like the residents are definitely in favor,\" Commissioners Chad Leister said. \"I know that I personally reached out to all our neighboring town councils and spoke to them, mainly just to see, some I guess bad feedback they would have for the chickens, and, as you know, there wasn't really a whole lot of it. So, I think I'm willing to be okay with it.\"\nThe commissioners made a motion to work on the legal wording of the town code to draft an ordinance to allow chickens within the town. The ordinance is expected to be presented at the next meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Easton leans away from annexing new land in comprehensive plan update\n\n September 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 728\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As planners draft Easton's new comprehensive plan, the town's direction on annexing new land is becoming clear: slow down.At a workshop Monday, the Easton Planning Commission chose to retain language in the comprehensive plan update that discourages new annexations in the next 10 years.\nAs recently as last year, Easton annexed around 17 acres of county land east of U.S. Route 50 between the Royal Farms and Unitarian Universalist Fellowship. It's expected to become an affordable housing project, though the developer will still need town approval on an application.\nTown Council members have indicated concerns about annexing additional land into town, especially as Easton deals with the question of whether it's maxing out on residential growth.\nThe comprehensive plan, last updated in 2010, is undergoing revisions before potential council approval later this year or early next year. It outlines how the town aims to grow in the next decade, touching on areas such as annexation, population growth and traffic.\nOn Monday and at a workshop last month, commission and council members noted that there may be exceptions to the no-annexation rule.\n\"I would have a hard time with being absolute about annexation, saying that that's not happening,\" Ward 2 Councilmember Robert Rankin said on Aug. 25. \"Because there may be exceptions.\"\nThe main exception to completely halting annexation seems to be Easton Point, the development project that seeks to revitalize Port Street and the area around the Tred Avon River. The effort hasn't significantly progressed in recent years, council members say.\nWard 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry said at last month's meeting that Easton Point's redevelopment is \"an enigma.\" She advocated that annexation of the county land in that area be excluded from any no-annexation directive in the new comprehensive plan.\n\"The Easton Point development project's been on the board for almost 20 years,\" Curry said. \"We have to find a way to move that forward if we can.\"\nTown leaders largely agreed that a project like Easton Point rises to the level of an \"extraordinary\" annexation that should be permitted under the comprehensive plan's guidance.\nStill, the plan should emphasize that annexation generally is \"not a priority for the town,\" said Planning Commission member Victoria McAndrews on Monday.\nGROWTH RATE\nHesitation to approve future annexation requests stems, in part, from the town's growth. From 2000 to 2010, the town's population increased 36%, according to census data. In the next decade, growth slowed to 7%, bringing Easton's population from 15,945 to 17,101.\nWhen commission and council members met for a joint workshop in August, the council maintained that the comprehensive plan should include a target growth rate for population. The 2010 version has a 1% annual growth rate, which for the most part hasn't been exceeded. Bumping it up to 1.75% was discussed.\nMichael Ports, the commission's vice chair, said Monday that 1.75% \"makes the most sense.\" But other commission members leaned toward a 1.14% annual growth rate, which is based off of historical trends.\nCommission Chairperson Phil Toussaint agreed with the 1.14% rate, emphasizing that it needs to be at a mark so the Town Council feels comfortable approving the plan as a whole.\nTRAFFIC\nWhen housing projects come to the commission or Town Council for approval, they include traffic impact studies. Developers typically hire a traffic engineering firm to conduct the study of the development's potential impact on traffic backups.\nPlanning Commission members said moving forward, the comprehensive plan needs to demand more thorough traffic reviews. Klein said studies often choose a few intersections next to the project and ignore the town's main arteries, where traffic is already an issue.\nEaston Planning and Zoning Director Miguel Salinas said the best way to expand the scope of a traffic impact study for a development is if town engineers or the State Highway Administration request a larger scope during meetings with the project's traffic engineer.\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh said he wants to continue requiring developers' traffic studies to include a percent change in traffic based on if the development were to be built.\nToussaint said he wants the studies to include more consideration on the impact to pedestrians, not just vehicles. He added that studies should be framed around the town's ongoing Complete Streets study, which is assessing Easton's roads on a large scale.\n\"What we've received in the past as a traffic impact study is going to be worthless for us going forward,\" Toussaint said. \"It's propaganda at this point, prepared by the applicant's engineers.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

County Attorney Patrick Thomas said there's currently around $731,000 ready for Talbot County to receive once it creates a fund.\nThomas noted the county must use the money for community-based initiatives, as defined by state law, such as after-school programs or homeless and housing prevention. The funds cannot be directed to law enforcement, Thomas said.\nA commission to administer the funds would be created if the bill is passed. A public hearing on the bill is slated for the Talbot County Council meeting on Oct. 14 at 5:30 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Cahall and Parker said the fees that businesses and residents pay on certain projects have not been changed since 2005. They said growth in county staff made the county look into the proposed changes.\n\"So Josh and I have reviewed the fee schedule, and it has not been updated since 2005,\" Cahall said. \"... Josh analyzed our environmental health services expenditures collections, of course you know that over the last four years and salaries, we've had a significant increase in salaries. This last year, FY25, we were able to really build our staff out.\"\nAccording to Parker, the cost of labor has gone up, and 90% of the Environmental Health budget has gone to labor.\nCahall and Parker listed multiple proposed changes, which the commissioners asked questions about.\nThe goal for the Health Department with the changes is to align fees with similar services in Planning and Codes and improve efficiency within the collection process. Some of the proposed changes combined fees, made fees cheaper or increased costs drastically.\nThe largest potential change came within the food section. The food service plan review — moderate and high priority fee showed a potential increase of $500 for the one-time fee.\nWhile plans of fee changes are not concrete. No changes can be made without going through the Caroline County Board of Health. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester council talks juvenile crime, other priorities with state legislators\n\n September 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Dorchester \n \n 643\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Dorchester County Council members provided a number of requests to local legislators on Tuesday in advance of the 2026 General Assembly, including an ask to tighten up on juvenile crime.During an annual meeting outlining the county's goals for statewide legislation this winter, Eastern Shore delegates and senators weighed in on the logistics of potential bills the county would like to see offered.\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) acknowledged the request for more stringent laws on juvenile crime. She noted that she and others are looking to see what comes out of the state's juvenile reform commission, which was created last year.\n\"I hear you loud and clear and know that there's something needs to be done,\" Sample-Hughes said. \"But I think we're in the trenches of trying to figure out what is in this task force.\"\nYouth crime in Cambridge has raised concerns in recent weeks, especially from Dorchester County Sheriff Jimmy Phillips. On the second day of school at Cambridge-South Dorchester High School, two students were arrested after assaulting the school safety monitor.\nSample-Hughes noted that last winter, a failed piece of legislation would have increased the age minimum from 14 to 16 for a juvenile to be tried as an adult. County Council Vice President Mike Detmer said it should go the other way, if anything.\nThat legislation even being proposed last year is a sign that \"the well's gonna be poisoned\" for any commission or task force recommendations, Detmer said.\n\"This is not hypothetical. This is reality that unfolds weekly in our town,\" Detmer said. \"And it's a hazard to people around and it's a hazard to them.\"\nCouncil Member Ricky Travers said state youth justice laws are \"setting up a whole group of juveniles for failure.\"\nMeanwhile, Council President Lenny Pfeffer said the county's warden has raised concern about separation requirements between juvenile and adult inmates.\n\"Our facility, being limited on staff, and size and logistics, sometimes finds it difficult to house a juvenile,\" Pfeffer said. \"We have to sometimes bring in additional personnel above the normal shift size.\"\nPfeffer said it's a \"one size fits all\" conundrum, where the rural and small Dorchester County can't as easily comply with state regulations.\nFor his part, Detmer said he's \"increasingly concerned about the legislature's encroachment on local control,\" noting he doesn't think the Eastern Shore legislators are responsible.\n\"We need to have something where there can be more nuance with blanket laws,\" Detmer said.\nWORKERS' COMP\nPfeffer said the county is bound by state law to pay out equal workers' compensations to all fire service volunteers, whether they perform on-duty or administrative roles. He asked if there's a way for state law to be adjusted so those working in purely administrative roles, and with less risk of workplace injury, could be classified differently.\nDel. Christopher T. Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) addressed the council's request. He warned that a workers' comp bill won't be easy. He added that it's important the county doesn't get caught reducing workers' comp for someone who may switch between field service and office work.\n\"Don't get mixed up in these scenarios where you have an audit and/or you have a person that does clerical work on Monday through Wednesday, but then ends up on a fire call Thursday or Friday and then gets hurt,\" Adams said.\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) asked council members to take a look at workers' compensation laws that other counties are bound by to see if there's something that could work.\nOther potential legislation discussed by the County Council and state legislators on Tuesday included:\nOutlawing the use of shoulders to pass vehicles in left-turn lanes. Dorchester County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Robbie Larimer said there's been accident concerns.Reducing or removing the requirements for the county to advertise leases in newspapers. Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said he's tried to see through a bill on the matter multiple times, though it's never passed. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Running as part of this team ensures we will continue delivering results for the people who sent us to Annapolis.\"\nHershey, who serves alongside the three delegates, praised their record and offered his support for their reelection.\nEarlier this month, Hershey, a Republican, announced that he had launched an exploratory committee to look into the viability for a gubernatorial campaign.\n\"Delegates Arentz, Jacobs and Ghrist have proven themselves to be tireless advocates for the Eastern Shore. Their leadership, experience and dedication are exactly what the Shore needs in Annapolis, and I wholeheartedly support their reelection,\" Hershey said. \"As for my own future, I remain in the process of working through an exploratory committee to assess the viability of a run for governor in 2026. I will make a final decision by the end of the year whether to pursue that path or to seek reelection to my Senate seat.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Must have seven-foot clearance on sidewalks or 12-foot clearance on streets.Immediately removing animal excrement from sidewalks, streets, parks or other public places unless physically unable.Maintaining the water service line from the curb stop to the building.Maintaining plumbing inside meter pits and within the building.Installing and maintaining a Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV) if required.Keeping the water pit visible and maintaining plumbing inside it.Keeping weeds, grass, and vegetation under 6 inches.Keeping property free of litter, refuse, and unsightly growth.\nThe city is responsible for the following:\nMaintaining, repairing, operating public sewer mains under streets and public areas.Repairing and maintaining curbs, gutters, streets.Maintaining water mains.Maintaining service line up to curb stop.If a water meter is in an outdoor pit the city owns and maintains the meter and the pit.\nThe utility companies are responsible for the following:\nMaintaining meters and transformers on property that are part of the utility system.Servicing lines from pole to weatherhead.Maintaining all equipment and piping up to and including the gas meter. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He briefly served as an elected commissioner for the Town of St. Michaels in 2008 and 2009.\nWalish said he is running because he believes he could do a better job representing the Eastern Shore and responding to residents' needs than Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md. 1st). Harris has represented the district in Congress since 2010.\n\"The first week that you could register in February, I was there,\" Walish said. \"In fact, I was there on the second day, and I was just determined that I could do a better job.\"\nWalish had a seven-month stint as a commissioner of St. Michaels, until he resigned amid controversy surrounding the never-constructed Miles Point subdivision. Walish opposed a growth allocation awarded to the property's developer, which had been a key issue of his campaign, he said.\nWhen he resigned in 2009, Walish wrote in his resignation letter that \"It has become increasingly apparent over the last half of 2008 that it will not be possible to accomplish for the voters of St. Michaels the initiatives that I was elected to deliver to them.\"\nWhile Walish left only seven months into the office, he said he wanted to assure the Eastern Shore residents that he is not a quitter.\n\"I worked for the same company for 30 years. I was married to the same person for 33 years. So, I'm not a quitter,\" Walish said.\nWalish's business career includes leadership tenures with Xerox Corporation, Chrysler and BMW, where he became one of the company's youngest senior executives in North America.\nAs BMW's senior executive, he led the entire company's integration of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and chaired BMW's Diversity Committee. Under his leadership, BMW expanded diversity efforts across its workforce.\nWalish plans to focus on the health of the Chesapeake Bay if elected. He said he would also support farmers and watermen.\n\"For example, farmers are really having a tough time right now, and I would definitely support some sort of program that would help them,\" he said.\nThe 2026 primary election is scheduled for June, with the general election to follow in November. The winner will represent Maryland's 1st District in the U.S. House of Representatives for a two-year term. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As Rotarians, we recognize the importance of service above self, and this memorial will continue to remind us of the service and sacrifices so many have made to keep us free.\"\nHundreds of POW/MIA Chairs of Honor can be found in public spaces around the country, ranging from professional sports stadiums to city halls, and even the U.S. Capitol Building. The perpetually empty chair is meant to help people remember that even though the soldiers are not here, there's always a place for them.\nNewark already has a Chair of Honor that is used at the annual Memorial Day ceremony and displayed inside city hall. However, the new one is suitable for outdoor display.\nThe chair was installed in an area of the city hall parking lot that also includes flagpoles and a plaque honoring city employees who served in the military. It is surrounded by stanchions topped with symbols representing each of the branches of the military, and a bronze plaque explains the purpose of the chair and includes the words \"You are not forgotten.\"\nWith the blessing of city council, the Rotary Club funded the project and committed to maintaining the display in the future.\nRosely Robinson, who has helped install dozens of Chairs of Honor throughout Delaware and surrounding states, noted that since World War II, there are still 81,000 service members unaccounted for.\n\"Outside of their families and friends, they have nearly been forgotten,\" Robinson said. \"This chair serves as a constant reminder of those still missing and that we have a place for them when they come home.\"\nOf those missing, 121 are from Delaware.\n\"It doesn't sound like a big number, but 121 families, brothers, sisters, moms and dads are still waiting, and they should never be forgotten,\" Robinson said.\nRalph Galati, an Air Force captain whose plane was shot down over North Vietnam, was a prisoner of war for 14 months.\n\"It was not heroic. It was not brave,\" Galati said. \"But it was performing one's duty, hopefully with dignity and to be able to return with honor.\"\nHe said he and his fellow prisoners showed their resolve through resistance by having church services, singing the national anthem and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\"All of them were forbidden to be discussed and performed during captivity,\" he said. \"Yet they were the very things that mattered the most to us, so we proudly recited them, regardless of the punishment or consequences. And today, none of these are taken lightly by me. It could be a flag flying gently overhead, or a song before a baseball game or a great rendition of the national anthem, the impact is still the same.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore on Friday.\nThe secretary criticized the project's work plan, arguing that Moore has \"prioritized race and gender-based requirements ahead of project completion.\"\nDemocrats in the Maryland congressional delegation responded in a joint statement, noting the bridge project was approved by Congress.\n\"As we have with other major infrastructure disasters with nationwide implications, Congress came together on a bipartisan basis to provide the full resources necessary for reconstruction to ensure it can be rebuilt as quickly and efficiently as possible,\" the lawmakers said.\n\"The federal government's commitment to fund the rebuild is enacted into law, and the construction contract was awarded through a legal, competitive, transparent process,\" they added.\nMoore did not address Duffy's comments about sex and race.\n\"We will continue to work with the Trump Administration to find ways to reduce costs and rebuild faster,\" Moore said in a statement. \"The safety of the bridge and the sound stewardship of taxpayer dollars remain our top priority as we work to fully restore economic vitality — not only to the Port of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, but for the people across the country.\"\nAlong with concerns over hiring practices, Duffy questioned the reconstruction project's budget.\n\"DEI contracting practices and ballooning project costs are already threatening to delay this critical project,\" Duffy said. \"We will leverage our oversight authorities to ensure this vital bridge is rebuilt the right way.\"\nPresident Donald Trump last month said on social media he might have to \"rethink\" federal support for the Key Bridge. He called Baltimore \"crime ridden\" and \"out of control\" and has threatened to send federal troops into the city, as he has in Los Angeles, Washington and Memphis.\nTrump's warning about the bridge funds followed Moore's invitation to Trump to visit Baltimore or \"keep our name out of your mouth.\"\nThe bridge collapsed in March 2024 after it was struck by a ship. The demolition of the bridge began in July. Following reconstruction, the bridge is slated to open in the fall of 2028. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Elmer Davis (Ward 4) will each host town halls open to their constituents at the Easton Volunteer Fire Department in the coming weeks.\nThe town halls were mentioned during Easton's recent election, including by Don Abbatiello, now council president and then Ward 2 representative.\nAbbatiello said he aims to attend all four town halls.\n\"We wanted to make sure that we left no stone unturned when it came to sharing information,\" Abbatiello said.\nRankin will kick off the meetings with Ward 2 residents on Monday. Montgomery will host Ward 3's discussion on Oct. 9. Davis will lead Ward 4's on Oct. 23, and Curry will wrap it up with Ward 1's meeting on Oct. 27. All four meetings will be held at the Easton fire hall from 7 to 8 p.m.\nAbbatiello said the idea to host semi-regular ward town halls birthed from discussions on the campaign trail, with some residents feeling like they didn't have enough access to town information or couldn't attend town meetings, which are typically twice a month at 5:30 p.m.\nThe council president said the town's done a good job in improving its communication to residents since he joined the council in 2019, especially on its website and social media platforms. The new town halls are a continuation of that effort, he said.\nCouncil members will provide brief presentations to residents at the meetings, updating them on recent projects in town and their respective wards. Then, the sessions will open up for feedback and questions from the public.\n\"We want residents to be informed and know what's going on,\" Rankin said. \" ... The more we can hear from folks … that really helps us a lot.\"\nHousing, growth and traffic are expected to be major points of discussion, council leaders said.\n\"The central topic, for me at least, will be growth,\" Montgomery said. \"And I think that's a topic that concerns everybody of Ward 3 because of how residents have to tend to traffic.\"\nRankin said he expects his discussion to touch on recent development projects and the town's comprehensive plan, which is in the process of being updated for the first time since 2010 and will lay out a vision for the town's growth over the next decade.\nDavis said that in addition to growth and development, he expects to field questions on the Easton Police Department and resident concerns about safety.\nThe Ward 4 representative highlighted the town halls as another avenue to be open with the public.\n\"Everybody can be included and get some questions answered,\" Davis said. \"Our main goal is to show transparency to the community.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "County weighs ICE Program: Officials seek details on 287(g) jail enforcement model before considering public comment and vote\n\n September 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 654\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — Queen Anne's County officials say they are seeking more information from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement about the county's eligibility for a 287(g) Jail Enforcement Model program.At an informal community forum Sept. 29 hosted by Eastern Shore Indivisible at the Kent Island branch of the Queen Anne's County Public Library, County Commissioner President Chris Corchiarino and Sheriff Gary Hofmann updated residents on the status of discussions with ICE.\nCorchiarino said the county has not yet been told whether it qualifies for the Jail Enforcement Model, one of three agreements available under ICE's 287(g) program. He emphasized that no plans are in place.\n\"We're waiting to hear from federal officials,\" Corchiarino said. \"We don't have clear details or expectations yet of what a memorandum of understanding would look like.\"\nProgram background\nUnder the Jail Enforcement Model, correctional officers can be deputized with limited federal authority to serve civil detainers within a county detention facility. Other models under 287(g) include the Warrant Service Officer and Task Force programs, though Corchiarino said Queen Anne's is not pursuing those.\nOn July 30, the county's Republican Central Committee hosted an informational meeting in Stevensville with James Brooks, community relations officer for ICE's Washington and Baltimore field offices. Following that session, Corchiarino said, residents asked county leaders to seek more information about the county's eligibility.\nHe noted that requirements for correctional facilities vary by jurisdiction in Maryland. In Queen Anne's County, the detention center falls under the authority of the county commissioners rather than law enforcement.\n\"If we find out we're not eligible, then it's a moot point,\" Corchiarino said. \"If we are eligible, then we'll need to look at requirements and a cost analysis. Any decision would go through public comment and ultimately a commission vote.\"\nThere is no set timeline, he said, adding that even if ICE responds soon, the matter would take time before reaching an agenda.\nCommunity questions and concerns\nDuring the forum, some residents voiced concerns about immigration enforcement and civil rights. One man who identified himself as part of the Hispanic community said he had been detained twice \"on the west side of the bridge\" and carried laminated copies of his birth certificate out of fear.\n\"What's going to be done to ensure I keep my American rights … without being afraid of the lights in the rearview mirror?\" he asked, drawing applause.\nHofmann said the sheriff's office does not have authority to serve civil detainers and in his 30 years could recall only one case involving an ICE civil detainer in the county. He stressed that the role of ICE is separate from the role of county commissioners or the sheriff's office.\n\"Regardless of origin, whether American or immigrant, there are bad people with warrants for crimes, and we are obligated to enforce the criminal law,\" Hofmann said.\nHe added that ICE falls under the umbrella of Homeland Security Investigations and that since 2010 the county sheriff's office has had a designated desk for Homeland Security agents, used in rare but valuable partnerships on cases involving fraud, child pornography and human trafficking.\n\"What I don't want to do is create fear amongst our community,\" Hofmann said. \"We want people to get the services they need here in Queen Anne's County. We are genuinely here to take care of everyone fairly and equally.\"\nCalls for transparency\nSome residents said they want more public collaboration when federal topics arise.\n\"This affects everyone. It's not just Republicans or Democrats. We should be working together to protect our community,\" one Grasonville woman said.\nA Centreville woman added that she wanted reassurance county law enforcement would remain lawful and not adopt questionable tactics she had heard about elsewhere.\nCorchiarino said he considers public input an important factor in any decision.\n\"A room full of people, that's persuasive for me,\" he said.\nSilvia Gonzalez Roman, co-founder of Eastern Shore Indivisible, said the group invited an ICE representative to the forum but did not receive a response.\n\"Building community with open dialogue is what it is all about,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

These included:Town electionsCommissioners discussed the possibility of creating a supplemental municipal voter list in addition to the county's list.\nThey plan to discuss the matter further at a workshop on Oct. 8 and are actively seeking the public's feedback.\nEthics ordinance recommendations from the Ethics CommissionCommissioners considered revising the ethics ordinance after the Ethics Commission said the current version is confusing from years of edits.\nAdditional proposals included adding an alternate member, staggering terms for continuity, and clarifying the distinction between the Ethics and Town commissions.\nMembers of the Ethics Commission suggested narrowing financial disclosure rules, which currently require candidates to report all global property and business interests, to instead focus on conflicts of interest within Maryland.\nThe Ethics Commission also discussed separate disclosure standards for elected officials, appointed members and staff, and agreed to add a campaign finance section requiring filings at candidacy, election and post-election.\nThe updates are slated for completion by February ahead of the next election cycle.\nEconomic development prioritiesThe Oxford Business Association pressed town leaders for clear economic development priorities to guide its work, particularly on tourism and use of accommodation tax revenues, now at historic lows.\nCommissioners asked for detailed budgets and proof of return on investment before committing tax dollars, moving away from funding with \"no strings attached.\"\nThe association's representative said they must consult members before releasing past financials. They agreed performance metrics, like website analytics, which are currently hindered by technical issues, will be needed once town priorities are defined.\nShort-term rental permitting processCommissioners considered adopting a software called Granicus to crack down on unlicensed short-term rentals, estimating 35 to 44 units operate in town but only five hold permits.\nThe program, already in use by Talbot County, would cost Oxford $2,000 a year.\nThe software would also help enforce a proposed rule requiring license numbers in rental ads, which officials say are easier to track than actual bookings.\nBreezeline franchise agreementCommissioners are reviewing their franchise agreement with Breezeline, weighing whether to stay with the old terms or adopt a new template that covers only cable.\nThe draft also drops the 2% public, educational and government funding, meaning the town would need to add a franchise fee of up to 5% to recoup costs.\nCommissioners said they'll hold a public hearing, likely after the holidays, to gather resident feedback on service quality before entering negotiations.\nUtility payment processingCommissioners are exploring new approaches to utilities and services, including an online portal for utility bill payments that would allow credit card use but carry a 1.5% to 3.5% transaction fee which will likely be passed on to residents rather than absorbed by the town.\nAn Automated Clearing House payment option through Shore United Bank is also being considered, with specific cost proposals to be discussed at a future meeting.\nElectric fees paid by the townThe Electric Vehicle Institute has offered to replace the current chargers with faster, pay-as-you-go chargers that would eliminate the current expense of $600.\nCommissioners will also separately review electricity costs tied to the watermen's boat slips, citing the town's commitment to its working waterfront. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The hope for the park as a whole is to honor first responders and veterans of Caroline County.\n\"We've got a lot of first responders that live in our community, and we want to make sure that we've got a place to acknowledge them. So that's something we're really excited about,\" Mayor Abby McNinch said.\nThe council approved a proposal in the amount of $294,699 from Kompan Inc. to furnish and install playground equipment at Sharp Road Park.\nThe town received $300,000 in grant funding from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Community Parks and Playgrounds program for phase one of the project.\nThe DNR grant funding will be used to fund $274,426.86 of the playground costs, and the remaining grant funding will be used to fund engineering costs related to the project. The Town will fund the remaining $20,272 for playground surfacing.\nDenton has additional play equipment planned for a second phase of construction, but the town will need to secure additional funding from the state to complete phase two.\nThe park is expected to receive multiple upgrades in the near future, which started with a mural honoring first responders on the basketball court created by Terae Warner, a local business owner and basketball coach, and artist Shelton Hawkins.\nMore additions expected at Sharp Road Park include an outdoor exercise circuit, flag court and highly anticipated dog park.\n\"It seems like everybody's most excited about the dog park,\" McNinch said. \"We've heard the community about that, and that's something we're looking forward to putting in as well.\"\nThe flag court will include flags representing different branches of the military.\nCaroline County has started construction on the baseball field, softball field and multipurpose field at the park with hopes of the fields being finished by December.\nMcNinch said that the upgrade of Sharp Road Park has been a goal of hers since she entered office.\n\"You'll have the dog walkers, the people that are walking the trail, then the little kids that are playing, the kids that are playing soccer, basketball, all of it. It really becomes a community asset and kind of what we've envisioned for a long time, so we're excited,\" McNinch said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-10-11",

    "content": "Some thoughts on a US president from Maryland\n\n October 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 736\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n To date, no individual born or living in Maryland has been elected to serve as president of the United States.Ever since Gov. Wes Moore was elected in 2022, he has been viewed by many as a rising star in the Democratic Party.\nMany of his admirers have even suggested he has potential to be the Democratic Party's 2028 candidate for president.\nThat is not surprising. Wes Moore is a charismatic, progressive and relatively young elected official at a time when both major political parties are struggling mightily with internal divides between longtime and elderly party leaders and emerging younger leaders.\nDespite that political chatter, Moore has repeatedly said he will not run for president in 2028.\nInstead, he has said he is eager and ready to run for reelection as governor for a second four-year term.\nThat said, if Wes Moore does have future national ambitions, they may ultimately be delayed or derailed by another charismatic Maryland Democratic elected official — U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen.\nVan Hollen has had a long career in politics starting with elections to serve as a Democratic member in the Maryland House of Delegates and in the Maryland Senate.\nHe was elected to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives as the Democratic representative from Maryland's 8th Congressional District.\nIn 2016, he was elected to the United States Senate, re-elected to a second term in 2022, and is now the senior U.S. senator from Maryland.\nVan Hollen has not said anything about if or when he may run for president, but his actions speak louder than silence on this matter.\nVan Hollen has regularly and aggressively challenged a wide range of decisions and actions of the second Trump administration, including but not limited to federal government spending cuts, immigration deportments and closing or relocating federal agencies.\nVan Hollen has opposed Trump administration efforts to detain and deport El Salvador native Kilmar Abrego Garcia, maintaining Garcia has been denied due process on these efforts.\nIn September, he was the keynote speaker at a Democratic Steak Fry in Polk County, Iowa.\nIowa is a longtime early testing ground on the popularity and viability of presidential candidates from both major parties.\nVan Hollen has been a guest on Yahoo News, CBS News, CNN, NBC News and The Hill.\nBetween now and the next two election cycles, a lot can happen in the Maryland and national political arenas.\nIn Maryland, Wes Moore is widely expected to win a second term next year, but in today's volatile and unpredictable political environment, that is not a given.\nNext year, Maryland's Republican voters may nominate a candidate that unites, energizes and mobilizes their base voters. Those voters combined with enough Democratic and unaffiliated voters, could result in Wes Moore losing next November. That is unlikely, but not impossible.\nIn 2014, Democratic candidate and former Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown was almost universally expected to be elected governor, but he lost in a historic upset to Larry Hogan.\nKey elements of a winning political campaign always include messaging, money and meeting expectations.\nIn his upcoming reelection effort, Wes Moore will have no problem with messaging and raising campaign contributions.\nHe may find meeting or exceeding expectations to be a challenge.\nHis rising star status could be greatly diminished if, in a deep blue state, his reelection vote margin is significantly lower than his landslide win for the governorship the first time when he received 64.5 % of votes cast.\nOne unanswered question for Wes Moore and or Chris Van Hollen is if either would agree to be nominated as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2028.\nHistorically, pursuing a nomination for the vice presidency is not something candidates publicly announce or overtly pursue. Instead, presidential nominees for both major parties announce their choice for a vice presidential running mate and their choice is ratified at their party's national convention.\nThat was the case when Richard Nixon chose Maryland's former governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate in 1968. Agnew served in that role until 1973 when he resigned in disgrace.\nServing as a vice president as a pathway to nomination and election as president has had mixed success. Only six have done so since 1948 — Harry Truman, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush and Joseph Biden.\nUltimately, only time will tell if either Wes Moore or Chris Van Hollen will be the first Marylander in history to be nominated or serve as president of the United States or be the second Marylander in history to be nominated or serve as a U.S. vice president. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Ridgely responds to allegations made by ex-officers in lawsuit\n\n October 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Caroline \n \n 544\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY — The Town of Ridgely claims it acted lawfully when it disbanded its police force in 2024, according to a federal court filing made last week.Responding to a lawsuit filed by former Ridgely police officers in U.S. District Court in August, attorneys representing town commissioners and employees submitted a motion to dismiss claims made against the town by eight plaintiffs — former Police Chief Jeff Eckrich, six other officers and one civilian employee.\nIn the motion, submitted Friday, attorneys for the town argued Ridgely acted within its charter when eliminating the police department, a decision made for \"legislative and budgetary\" reasons, the motion states.\nPlaintiffs alleged the town violated due process when it suspended and later laid off all members of the Ridgely Police Department last year amid a state investigation into Eckrich for suspected misconduct in office. The plaintiffs also allege the town committed civil conspiracy and defamation.\nOfficers were laid off effective July 1, 2024. Later that month, the Office of the State Prosecutor released a report finding \"no sufficient evidence\" of misconduct by Eckrich. Ridgely commissioners chose not to reinstate the department despite pleas from residents to do so.\nAfter the state opened its investigation into Eckrich in March 2024, Ridgely entered into a temporary contract with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office to provide police coverage in town, a contract that was then renewed and adjusted after the town opted to lay off the officers in April 2024.\nThe former officers alleged the town and Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker \"orchestrated a coup\" to disband the department. Attorneys for the town disputed that in their response Friday.\nThe town's \"actions were lawful, discretionary, and justified by legitimate policy considerations,\" the defendants' argument, written by attorneys Kevin Karpinski and Bently Green Jr., reads.\nRidgely commissioners were made aware of the state's investigation \"weeks after\" it began, attorneys wrote.\n\"Once the OSP investigation concluded, the Town made a reasoned decision that reinstating the RPD was not feasible,\" the response reads.\nDefendants represented by Karpinski and Green are: current Ridgely Commissioner John Hurley, former Commissioners John Buckle and Anthony Casey, three town employees, the Town of Ridgely and James Joles — a former Ridgely officer whose complaints about Eckrich fueled the state prosecutor's investigation.\nThree other defendants — Baker, Chief Deputy Rodney Helmer and the State of Maryland — didn't file response motions by the Friday deadline, according to online federal court records.\nBaker told The Star Democrat on Monday that he and Helmer are being represented by the Office of the Attorney General, declining to comment further. The attorney general's office, closed Monday, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe initial lawsuit from August claimed Joles — an officer who resigned from the force in January 2024 — met with Baker, devising \"a plan that would eliminate the RPD and allow Sheriff's Office to assume responsibility for law enforcement\" in Ridgely.\nNo specific details or evidence substantiating the alleged meeting between Baker and Joles were provided in the plaintiffs' complaint, which was submitted by attorney Ray Shepard.\nJoles, in an interview last month, denied claims made in the lawsuit, adding that he only met the sheriff once and exchanged \"maybe a four-word conversation.\"\nJudge Brendan A. Hurson, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, will review the town's motion for dismissal. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Extensive testing has been conducted over the years, with the contamination shrinking due to a large pumping and air system installed by the previous owner, Russel Metals.\nThe EPA covenant is restrictive, primarily concerning water usage, but the EPA has indicated that as long as the project does not break the wellhead and uses water according to county instructions, it can proceed. The EPA also said that if three negative VOC tests are obtained after the project is on the property, it would consider removing the covenant.\nBeulah told the commissioners how great the location will be for the community after all renovations were completed.\n\"To take that big piece of building, that building and that property, clean it all up, fix it all up and have it as a resource center to serve the people in the community. All the agencies that can come together will come together under one roof, joining forces together, joining resources together, and providing us a significant services in our community,\" she said.\nThe commissioners asked Beulah and the group questions about what services will be included at the new location. The group responded with a full analysis of the building.\n\"So, it's three main components, three main partners. Aaron's Place, His Hope Ministry and the Food Aggregation, those are the three main ones,\" Beulah said.\nThe group said the project requires significant funding. They are forming a capital campaign committee and exploring various funding opportunities around the state, Beulah said, and wanted to make sure they had the commissioners' support for the project before proceeding.\nWhile the commissioners did not suggest a certain amount of money to support the project, the commissioners all said they will support the project and provide any help they can offer.\n\"I think it's a very worthwhile project,\" Commissioners Vice President Larry Porter said. \"I think if nothing else, it'll make that entrance to this town beautiful.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Raskin speaks to Dems in Easton; weighs in on shutdown, '26 midterms\n\n October 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 701\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) visited Talbot County Democrats in Easton on Sunday, taking aim at President Donald Trump and the Republican Party.In a nearly 40-minute keynote speech during the Talbot County Democratic Forum's annual Kennedy-King Unity Dinner, Raskin went on energetic runs to engage the crowd, alternating between current issues such as immigration enforcement and Trump's ongoing battles with federal courts since taking office.\nLocal officials, including Talbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher, attended.\nRaskin, who represents residents in Montgomery and Prince George's counties, hosted a town hall in Cambridge in March. He said he enjoys trips to the Eastern Shore, especially since he went to summer camp in Worton as a child.\n\"I come because I know you're the only Marylanders who don't have a Democratic member of Congress,\" Raskin told a packed crowd inside of Temple B'nai Israel on Sunday.\nRep. Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) is the representative for Eastern Shore residents.\nRaskin also used the speech to tout some of his optimistic and broad opinions, such as granting Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico statehood and abolishing the electoral college — a system he called \"an accident waiting to happen every four years.\"\nRaskin criticized Trump for imposing tariffs in a manner that the congressman said exceeds presidential power. He said Trump's actions are being rejected in district and appeals courts around the nation.\n\"The rule of law is holding, Donald Trump is losing until we get to just one court,\" Raskin said. \"There's one court that has been packed and stacked and sliced and diced and gerrymandered to his advantage and to his liking, which is the Supreme Court.\"\nAfter delivering the speech and accommodating a long line of local Democrats hoping to chat or take photos, Raskin weighed in on the ongoing government shutdown in an interview.\nHe said an agreement needs to be reached where people are not losing health care tax credits — the central issue driving the Senate's deadlock on an appropriations bill.\n\"I hope that our Republican colleagues will recognize that and come back to Washington and make a deal,\" Raskin said. \"But right now it's just Democrats in Congress waiting for the Republicans to come back home to D.C.\"\nMaryland Republicans in Congress have placed blame on Democrats, criticizing them for not OK'ing a continuing resolution to fund the government through Nov. 21. Harris said earlier this month that Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks, both Democrats, are part of the problem.\n\"Because so many Marylanders are federal employees, I think that the two senators should realize that will harm a lot of Marylanders,\" Harris said.\nTALK OF 2026\nSunday evening inside Temple B'nai Israel, early discussions on 2026 election strategy were held. Justin Butler, director of party affairs for the Maryland Democratic Party and a member of the Talbot County Democratic Central Committee, said the party needs to \"get back to voters\" and listen.\n\"Here in Maryland, we can't be out of touch,\" Butler said.\nRaskin said the biggest challenge facing Democrats is the national redistricting fight. Republicans have led pushes to redraw maps in states such as Texas and Florida, while Democrats have countered in California and New York.\n\"They have proven themselves to be focused like a laser beam on gerrymandering us into oblivion,\" Raskin said. \"We have to fight back at the state level wherever we can, and then we have to mobilize a huge popular movement to oppose that assault on democracy.\"\nIn Maryland, a state senator filed a bill to redraw the eight congressional districts— a proposal that would edit Harris' 1st District to remove Harford and Cecil counties and add part of Anne Arundel. Harris has said the proposal will lose in court, and \"perhaps the courts will redraw a nonpartisan map\" to flip seats for Republicans.\nLocally, Butler told the crowd Sunday that a priority for Democrats going into 2026 should be winning more seats on the Talbot County Council. Currently, Lesher and Keasha Haythe are two Democrats to three Republicans on the body.\n\"We have a chance, next year, to fix that,\" Butler said. \"To make sure that we have a majority on the County Council that's gonna be able to implement tolerance, compassion, unity and truly work for all citizens of Talbot County.\"\nThis story has been updated. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Town, county and state officials joined St. Vincent de Paul to cut the ribbon Wednesday on a larger pantry, thrift store and advisory offices.\n\"We are a community of tremendous opportunity, and we're very thankful for what we have,\" Easton Mayor Megan Cook said. \"But we're also a community of tremendous need. And the mission of St. Vincent de Paul really does help with that.\"\nPlaskon said after the event that the expansion project, led by Willow Construction, cost nearly $1.4 million. Between funds from the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development and Talbot County Council, and gifts from local donors, that mark was fully funded.\nCounty Council President Chuck Callahan said acts of philanthropy in the county impress him, including St. Vincent de Paul's work. Callahan chairs the board of the Neighborhood Service Center, a nonprofit on the other side of town.\n\"It's a big effort on all of us, and that's really what this community is all about,\" Callahan said.\nThe relocated food pantry allows volunteers more space to operate on busy pickup days. A refrigerator and freezer were added to the end of the food pantry, along with other new equipment.\nSt. Vincent de Paul broke ground on the expansion in August 2024. It was a three-phase endeavor that Plaskon said \"flowed pretty smoothly\" over the last year and change.\nThe nonprofit's new thrift store has raked in more money, which goes toward the food pantry and advisory offices. Plaskon said weekly returns have risen 35% to around $9,000 a week.\nPlaskon recently took over as president of the organization, which is made up of over 300 volunteers and has no paid employees. On Wednesday, he presented a proclamation honoring former president Alex Handy, who served in the role for 16 years.\nHandy had similar praise for his successor.\n\"I am so grateful for having John step forward in that meeting and ever since, taking over this project,\" Handy said. \"He has done a miracle amount of work here, and I can't thank him enough for steering us and steering this project to a wonderful culmination today.\"\nJust before the ribbon was cut, the Rev. James Nash, pastor of Sts. Peter & Paul Church in Easton, told St. Vincent de Paul volunteers just how important they are to the community.\n\"A lot of the people on the day of food pickup, they will come here an hour and a half early or two hours early, just to sit,\" Nash said. \"So you not only provide food. ... You give people the chance to just shut down for an hour or an hour or 20 minutes. ... And you offer them a place to come that's safe, where they feel heard, where they feel cared about.\"\nNash said he's seen other St. Vincent de Paul chapters during his career. The Easton one stands out.\n\"Nothing like this, nothing like this,\" Nash said of other chapters. \"You all have a lot to be proud of.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Talbot Family Network, the board responsible for the county's youth and family services, will serve as the commission.\nAfter the public hearing yielded no comments, the council moved the bill to third reading and approved it 4-0. Council member Lynn Mielke abstained.\nThe county must use the money for community-based initiatives, as defined by state law, such as after-school, behavioral health, housing or homeless prevention programs. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton police seek permits for future protests\n\n October 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 620\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — While police said Saturday's No Kings protest in Easton remained civil, they're asking the town to consider requiring public assembly permits for similar future protests.Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey raised the concern at a Town Council meeting Monday. He said Saturday's protest — during which hundreds lined sidewalks on Dover Road — was a challenge for police.\n\"As with any big event, my concern with police coverage is the unexpected, the person who does not appreciate that (protest),\" Lowrey said. \"We've seen it all across our country. It's a little frustrating when these events are not going through the public assembly event process, to allow us to plan.\"\nEaston's No Kings rally was just one of thousands nationwide, where people gathered in opposition of the Trump administration. Lowrey said one counter-protester remained civil, though police did get a call from a business concerned about people crowding parking lots.\nTalbot County Democratic Central Committee Chair Phil Jackson said in an interview that the committee and the Talbot County Democratic Forum were in \"regular contact\" with the mayor and police in advance of Saturday's rally to ensure safety.\nAlso on Saturday in Easton, police and emergency officials held a mass casualty simulation, designed to train first responders in an active shooter scenario. The training ran from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Temple B'nai Israel and surrounding areas.\nLowrey said the Easton Police Department had a \"great deal of resources committed\" to that simulation. Combined with the large protest, the agency's patrol division was \"essentially wiped out.\"\n\"We were able to respond to a call here or there, but if something happened, at that point, it comes at the expense of all the other citizens in the town because we have no officers available to respond to other emergencies,\" he said.\nSaturday's No Kings protest didn't obtain a public assembly permit, nor did the first No Kings gathering in June. Lowrey said the town should look at rewording its public assembly permit rules to explicitly require such protests obtain a permit beforehand.\nThe police chief said the permits allow the department to adequately staff both the event and day-of calls or emergencies.\nAccording to town code, permits must be obtained for \"any open air public meeting, rally, conference, assembly or similar gathering upon any public property.\" The word \"protest\" is not included in the code.\nPermit applications cost $100, though some events require additional costs depending on the equipment and police officers needed. Permits are first reviewed by police and then either approved or denied by the Town Council. Rarely does the council reject a permit request after a positive police recommendation, though some requests in the past have garnered debate and slim majorities, such as the Delmarva Pride Festival.\nJackson noted that the No Kings Day protests are nationally coordinated and then organized at a local level in the days and weeks leading up. Local organizers, he said, are open to following any new or adjusted permit requirements brought by the town.\n\"We are very interested in ensuring that these events comply with local policy,\" Jackson said. \"Should the Town of Easton move forward with changes to their public gathering permits, we will look to comply with those and follow the process.\"\nLowrey added that Easton police typically provide as much coverage as possible for public assemblies at no cost by using on-duty officers. Feedback from Saturday, he said, was that officers were helpful. But he hopes the department can better prepare for future protests.\n\"But when you have 800 to 1,200 people lining streets and stuff, things can go wrong very quickly,\" he said. \"And that's always my biggest fear. It takes a car driving through 30 people, and we have a mass casualty, actually, incident, and not an exercise.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
