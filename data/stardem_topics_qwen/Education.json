She was elected president of the board in December 2020 and held the role through 2022.Moving forward, Delean-Botkin said she hopes the Board of Education continues to maintain the county's high graduation rate and low dropout rate, expand its Career and Technical Education completer courses and implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a statewide plan to increase public education funding, improve student outcomes and improve the quality of public education.\"The other big thing that we're very proud of is having as many students as wish to go ahead and take the Advanced Placement classes and exams,\" Delean-Botkin said.At a July 19 Talbot County Board of Education meeting, President Emily Jackson said the board wishes Delean-Botkin the best of luck.\"We will miss her words of wisdom and her guidance,\" Jackson said.Talbot County Public Schools Executive Assistant Charlene Gould said in an email that the governor's office has been notified of the vacancy and will appoint a new board member to fill Delean-Botkin's seat until elections in November 2024.She said interested candidates can submit an application to the Governor's Appointments Office.In June, Commissioners Tom Costigan and Jimmy Jaramillo appointed Delean-Botkin to fill Commissioner Brian Wells' seat.Wells resigned at the June 27 Commissioners of Oxford meeting. He said he was resigning because he was moving to Easton.Before being appointed, Delean-Botkin ran against and lost to now Commissioner Katrina Greer. Greer took the seat of Jaramillo, who did not seek reelection.Delean-Botkin said her new role as Oxford commissioner is a \"challenging\" one.\"I think what we have to look at is, Oxford a town of about 600 folks,\" she said.\"Three sides are surrounded by water, so we have limits on growth. People tend to want to move to Oxford because of the quality of life.Majority of people that I talk to do not want to see many things change. They want to maintain the integrity of the town.\" \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY MAGGIE TROVATO\n \nSusan Delean-Botkin has resigned from the Talbot County Board of Education. \n \n Memo: \"The other big thing that we're very proud of is having as many students as wish to go ahead and take the Advanced Placement classes and exams.\" - Susan Delean-Botkin \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Kent 4-H alumna Jill Bramble to lead National Council\n\n August 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Trish Mcgee; For The Star Democrat | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1501\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Jill Bramble, who says the lessons she learned in 4-H while growing up in Kent County informed her leadership mode, has ascended to the very top of the organization.She has been named president and CEO of the National 4-H Council, the private sector, nonprofit partner of Cooperative Extension's 4-H program that focuses on fundraising, brand management, communications, and legal and fiduciary services.Her first day in the new role is Aug. 18.Bramble's appointment followed an 18-month, externally led search. According to a news release, the National 4-H Council board of trustees was unanimous in its support of Bramble.She has spent nearly 20 years as a member of the National 4-H Council team, beginning as a grant writer, and is currently the executive vice president and chief growth officer.\"I am humbled and honored to have this opportunity,\" Bramble said in a telephone interview July 23. \"4-H did so much for me as a young person. I feel so fortunate to be a product of this organization and I want to give back.\" Bramble said she stands on the shoulders of many Kent County mentors, family and friends. Among those she listed by name are John Hall, who was the University of Maryland Extension agent during her youth, Laura Bradley, and the Debnam, Crow, Dulin, Lott, Moffett and Hill families.Bramble traces her 4-H lineage to great-grandmother Susan Clarkson Fry who was a volunteer and supported the program in Montgomery County.Maternal grandparents Edwin C. \"Pop\" and Lorraine Fry, and their four young children, moved to Fair Hill Farms, near Chestertown, in 1960.The Fry family continues to own and operate the dairy and grain farm. The youngsters in the family, Matt and Megan Fry's sons Reid and Owen, are Intermediate age 4-H'ers in the Kent Clover Calf Club.In the 1980s, as a member of the Kennedyville Blue Banner 4-H Club, Bramble was involved in dairy, public speaking and photography projects and the ambassador program.\"I was a complete failure in all the sewing projects,\" she said in the phone interview, good-naturedly poking fun at herself.Pat Hill, who was the club leader then, said she was pleased and proud - but not surprised - to learn of Bramble's promotion.As a youth, Bramble embraced the 4-H motto \"To make the best better,\" according to Hill.\"I think she's still striving to that end,\" Hill wrote in an email Sunday. \"'Pop' Fry (Mr. Ed) would have been so proud.\" Hill pointed to Bramble as \"a role model for current 4-H members and all of Kent County youth.\" One of Hill's most treasured keepsakes is a counted cross-stitch 4-H emblem that Bramble made as a 4-H'er.Hill said she hangs that ornament on her Christmas tree every year.Another of Bramble's local supporters is Beth Hill, who has been the 4-H educator with University of Maryland Extension in Kent County for 28 years.\"It's amazing,\" Beth Hill said of Bramble's appointment.In an interview July 22, during the final night of the Kent County Fair, Beth Hill said: \"We're very proud that someone who had a passion for 4-H as a young person took that passion to the national level, helping kids across the country.\" She recalled that Bramble was invaluable in helping Kent County 4-H meet the endowment challenge of raising $10,000 in five years.\"Jill met with me in my office (in 2006) and told me, 'You can do this,'\" Beth Hill said.Through car washes and bake sales and other events, Kent 4-H'ers raised the $10,000 in three years.Bramble's grandparents, the Frys, made the first donation.Today, the endowment is at $86,000, according to Beth Hill.Nonprofit leadership was not the original plan for Bramble, who graduated from the University of Colorado in 1993 with a degree in kinesiology as a step toward a possible career as a physical therapist.Instead, she returned to Kent County about the same time that a family member was diagnosed with breast cancer.She started out as a volunteer with the American Cancer Society and ultimately landed a job as income development director tasked with corporate and special event fundraising for the mid-Atlantic division.Bramble said that's when the proverbial light bulb went off in her head that the more resources and donations you raise, the more you can impact a mission.She credited the six years she spent with the Cancer Society for sparking her interest in nonprofit leadership.Bramble went back to school and earned a master's degree in nonprofit management from the University of Maryland in 2001.From there she joined Just Cause Consultants in Chestertown, where she flourished under the mentorship of Linda Walls in grant writing as well as learning the ins and outs of board development and strategic planning for nonprofits and funders.As Bramble and her husband Scott started their family - son Nick and daughter Jordan are now college graduates - she said she began to give serious thought about \"how kids grow and what is on their minds.\" In a stroke of good fortune, what Bramble described as \"serendipity,\" the National 4-H Council was advertising for a grant writer.She remembered thinking that after having had the opportunity as a youngster to grow through 4-H, she needed to \"pay it forward,\" and her excitement about leading nonprofits made this an ideal opportunity for her.Hired in May 2005, she has spent the past 18 years and three months with the National 4-H Council.As a senior vice president and chief development officer, Bramble led the national resource development team that advances strategic individual, corporate and foundation partnerships in support of the 4-H mission.In March 2022, she was elevated to executive vice president and chief growth officer.Bramble said part of what drives her is the ideal that all youth have access to the opportunities that 4-H offers, which include growing life skills like confidence, independence, resilience and compassion.4-H is America's largest youth development organization, with six million boys and girls ages 5 to 19 and 600,000 volunteers nationwide.The origin of 4-H dates to the turn of the 20th century, and was first called a Corn Club because agriculture was then the leading industry.While ag is still very much a part pf 4-H, the organization is expanding to include robotics, coding, engineering and even artificial intelligence.Bramble said 4-H is a microcosm of America, and what people see locally differs in each community.For example, in the inner city of Dallas, Texas, the program is focused on technology and AI.\"I don't want to take away from how critical agriculture is - it provides food, clothing and housing - but 4-H is more than that,\" Bramble said. \"It is to encourage kids to take on leadership roles and engage them in their communities.\" Bramble said she has witnessed firsthand the transformative power of 4-H programs.\"As the leader of the National 4-H Council, I will spend every single day ensuring all kids have access to the powerful, life-changing outcomes that I experienced in my own childhood,\" she said in a news release.\"I have endless faith in the leadership of the next generation if we give them the tools they need to be successful,\" she said, adding that her role \"will be to empower Cooperative Extension 4-H educators to help America's youth reach their full potential.\" In announcing Bramble's appointment, the National 4-H Council noted her 18 years of successful leadership experience at the organization and a deep commitment to its mission, values and goals.Throughout her time with the National 4-H Council, Bramble \"has consistently demonstrated her dedication to empowering young people, fostering innovation, and strengthening partnerships,\" the organization stated in a news release. \"Her strategic insights, collaborative approach, and passion for positive youth development make her the ideal candidate to lead the National 4-H Council into its next phase of growth and impact.\" Bramble succeeds Jennifer Sirangelo, who is leaving after 10 years as president and CEO to lead Points of Light.\"While it's hard to step away from 4-H,\" Sirangelo said in a news release, \"this transition is easier knowing that Jill will be National 4-H Council's next leader. Jill is the best person for this role. I have the utmost confidence in her and know the future is bright with her at the helm.\" Bramble will be able to continue to work remotely from her home in Bluffton, South Carolina, while spending one week a month at headquarters in Washington.She extended an open invitation to Kent County residents, current 4-H'ers and 4-H alumni to visit whenever she is in D.C.Kent County will always be \"home,\" said Bramble, who has family and friends still living here.She said she hopes that in her new position she can continue to give back to Kent County. \n \n Caption: JILL BRAMBLE\n \nCONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nWhile growing up in Kent County, Jill Bramble was a member of the Kennedyville Blue Banner 4-H Club, where she was involved in dairy, public speaking and photography projects and the ambassador program.\n \nCONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nA teenaged Jill Bramble is pictured with Peppermint Patty, her first 4-H project, given to her by her grandfather Edwin C. \"Pop\" Fry when she was 8 years old and the cow was just a calf. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was later the academic and career adviser guiding students through actionable plans to achieve their goals.A native of Costa Rica, Solano came to the United States as a graduate student.After earning her bachelor's degree in Costa Rica, she worked for an international flower exporter as she continued her studies toward licensure at the University of Costa Rica.Her future plans took a turn when a professor at the university asked if she was adventurous.Thinking that the professor meant bungee jumping or some other daredevil sport, Solano prepared to decline. Instead, the professor asked if she would be interested in taking on a new academic challenge in a different country. He recommended her for a graduate research post at the University of Maryland.While working on \"green\" roof research and earning her master's degree in natural resources science at College Park, Solano's interest grew in building sustainable communities through policy and education.She went on to earn a Ph.D.in public policy and urban affairs at the University of Delaware.\"It's ironic that I studied urban affairs and ended up in a rural area,\" Solano said. \"Rural and urban areas face many of the same challenges, though, and people in both areas want the same things.\" Better lives and a greater sense of community, Solano said, are common desires for most people.The Cambridge Center provides both, she added. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED.\n \nLorelly Solano is the new director of the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The event drew about 2,100 participants.The annual event, organized and run by volunteers, has grown into one of the state's largest ride and has helped to raise more than $2 million with 15,000 participates since the ride's inception in 2001. Now, much more than a ride, Chrome City is a way for the community to learn more about Benedictine's mission to help children and adults with developmental disabilities achieve their greatest potential.The school serves students from the entire Mid-Atlantic region, including Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Virginia.Each year students dance along with Rockin' Elvis and riders and participants vie for the Sister's Choice award. This year an orange HD Turbo Road King was the grand prize winning bike, and Ray Nails with a red and silver 1954 Pontiac Star Chief was the grand prize car winner. New this year was the Kid's Choice awards given to Donald Teat in a national grand champion Huckster and Mike Ledbetter in his Harley Davidson motorcycle.For the first time in the event's history, Benedictine auctioned off a donated-signed Paul Reed Smith electric guitar with all proceeds going to benefit the organization.\"We are honored to have so many car enthusiasts from all over the state come to support the kids each year,\" said Spud Blake, Chrome City Ride volunteer chair. \"This is an event where our kids love seeing the cars and motorcycles. They interact with the various owners.The owners take a lot of great individual time to show the kids what is special about their cars and motorcycles.\" Generous sponsors, community partners, and volunteers continue to make the event a success year after year. Blake thanked CPR Vintage Porsche Restoration in Easton for helping to promote the event and serving as a registration location as well as Outback Steakhouse in Annapolis, Rommel Harley-Davidson Delmarva of Salisbury, Old Glory Harley-Davidson dealership, and Hitchcock Autoworks for serving as registration locations and rally points.Volunteers from Callahan's Gas and Appliance in Centreville helped with parking the hundreds of cars on campus, along with volunteers from Choptank Transport in Preston.Each rider passed under a large American flag at Benedictine's front entrance waving from a ladder truck. Famous Dave's provided a hot barbecue lunch, and each rider took home a collectible T-shirt printed and designed by Benedictine's Graphics department.Notable attendees in years past include Candy Clark, Cindy Williams and Bo Hopkins from the George Lucas 1973 classic American Graffiti, as well as area legislators. The event has attracted celebrity donors as well. For more than five years car enthusiast and talk show host Jay Leno donated to the event, as well as a collector from New Jersey who donated a 1941 Willys Pro Street Coupe in 2016. This year's 2019 event bought the largest crowd of riders and spectators to date.At the beginning of 2018, the Benedictine School earned a two-year accreditation through 2020 from the National Commission for the Accreditation of Special Education Services.The accreditation placed the Benedictine School among 26 institutions in the nation to receive the honor out of about 200 special education schools.As a national commission that verifies and promotes excellence in education service, NCASES evaluates private special education programs through a process that encourages diversity of educational practice and innovation. The process assures students in private special education settings are provided environments that are healthy, safe, comfortable and conducive to learning.NCASES also named Benedictine School teacher Lorraine Slama the 2018 Educator of the Year.For more information about the Benedictine School, visit www.benschool.org.@Kayla StarDem \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO/\n \nMotorcycles thundered down the mile-long lane onto the Benedictine School campus during the 18th annual Chrome City Ride in Ridgely Sunday, July 28.\n \nPHOTO BY KAY LA RIVAS/\n \nMore than 2,100 classic cars, street rods and motorcycles from six rally points across Maryland and Delaware thundered onto the Benedictine campus on Sunday, July 28, for Chrome City Ride.

    "content": "School district saves thousands in energy costs - Program focuses on use and use reduction\n\n August 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 17 | Section: News \n \n 581\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - Efforts by Caroline County Public Schools to reduce energy costs have resulted in almost $260,000 in savings as a result of a yearlong program managed by Cenergistic, an energy conservation company based in Dallas, Texas.Reporting at the Aug. 1 meeting of the Caroline County Board of Education, Cenergistic Client Manager Scott Muir shared a slide show depicting how the program has saved the school district money since July 1, 2022.School board president Richard Barton called the first annual report \"really exciting stuff.\" \"I've just got to give you guys big kudos,\" Muir said. \"This is one of the fastest and most successful starts to a program that I've seen.\" Muir and Superintendent Dr.Derek Simmons credited Cenergistic Energy specialist Josh Rein for his work in the district.\"Having Josh here from the very beginning\" was beneficial, Muir said. \"Typically we do have a challenge hiring an energy specialist from outside the district, so they have to develop all these relationships and try and do it quickly. And we just got off to a great start with him already knowing everyone here.\" Cenergistic created the energy conservation program that \"assists in minimizing the impact that cost increases has on the budget,\" according to the report. Four energy sources were considered: electricity, solar, heating oil and propane.The lion's share of cost increases was from electricity the school district buys from the grid at a 64% increase and heating oil with a 42% increase.\"There's not a whole lot we can do about the costs, so our company focuses on use and use reduction,\" Muir said.Relying on solar and setting back thermostats on weekends, nights and during the summer made a difference, Muir said.From July 2022 through June 2023, 80% of CCPS's utility spending was on electricity.\"That's a huge area of focus for Josh and our team,\" Muir said.However, even with the increases in energy costs, the public schools decreased energy use intensity (EUI) by 35%. Energy use intensity is a measure of 1,000 BTUs of energy per square foot, \"a benchmark that the EPA uses,\" Muir said. It's also used for Energy Star certification.\"It's a way of measuring elementary schools against other elementary schools, houses against houses, and the regional average here for K12 schools is 54 EUI,\" Muir said. \"When we started the program, you actually were doing pretty well; you were already at 50 EDI. And today, for the last 12 months, we're down to 32 EUI. So at that at that level, our company is going to be looking at getting certified for Energy Star for a lot of facilities.\" An \"energy savings day\" on Monday July 3, \"was a great little initiative and the results show,\" Muir said.Rein performed more than 1,516 building audits, \"and that equates to 1,451 metric tons of CO2 emissions avoided,\" Muir said. \"That's a huge environmental footprint.\" Muir compared the 1,451 metric tons of CO2, equating them to \"over 3.5 million miles driven by an average car,\" he said. \"That amount of energy can power 175 homes for the year.\" Cenergistic has a five-year contract with the Caroline County Public Schools.\"The message to the taxpayer is (our) more efficient use of money, and that's something you don't hear government say very often,\" Barton said.To view the full report, visit https://go.boarddocs.com/mabe/carps/Board.nsf/Public, open the Aug. 1 agenda and click on the \"Cenergistic Update\" link. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/TIMES RECORD\n \nCenergistic Client Manager Scott Muir shared a slide show depicting how the program has saved the school district over $250,000 since July 1, 2022 \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In the coming months, Cambridge residents are likely to meet Solano as she begins her community outreach efforts.The Cambridge Center, Solano said, is a resource for everyone in Dorchester County, playing a critical role in the economic and social health of the downtown area.In addition to credit classes in both transfer and career programs, the center also offers workforce training, personal enrichment opportunities and meeting spaces for community organizations. The center also houses the American Job Center.\"We're an education center for students of all ages, but I hope residents here also see us as a center of community growth,\" Solano said.Solano first joined Chesapeake as an English as a Second Language instructor.She was later the academic and career advisor guiding students through actionable plans to achieve their goals.A native of Costa Rica, Solano came to the United States as a graduate student.After earning her bachelor's degree in Costa Rica, she worked for an international flower exporter as she continued her studies toward licensure at the University of Costa Rica.Her future plans took a turn when a professor at UCR asked if she was adventurous.Thinking that the professor meant bungee jumping or some other daredevil sport, Solano prepared to decline. Instead, the professor asked if she would be interested in taking on a new academic challenge in a different country.He recommended her for a graduate research post at the University of Maryland.While working on \"green\" roof research and earning her master's degree in natural resources science at College Park, Solano's interest grew in building sustainable communities through policy and education.She went on to earn a Ph.D. in public policy and urban affairs at the University of Delaware.\"It's ironic that I studied urban affairs and ended up in rural area,\" Solano said. \"Rural and urban areas face many of the same challenges, though, and people in both areas want the same things.\" Better lives and a greater sense of community, Solano said, are common desires for most people. The Cambridge Center provides both, she added.For more information about the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center, please visit www.chesapeake.edu/cambridge. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nDr. Lorelly Solano is the new director of the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mid-Shore Pro Bono interns gain valuable experience\n\n August 17, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Detmer; mdetmer@chespub.com | Page: A2 | Section: News \n \n 1673\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - As the summer academic break enters its final phase, three Maryland students working as interns at Mid-Shore Pro Bono this summer reflected on their experiences thus far.Clay Benedict of Baltimore, James Parkinson of Oxford, and Gabrielle Shlikas were selected as the nonprofit's summer 2023 interns.Benedict is a legal intern through the University of Baltimore School of Law's EXPLOR program.The program ensures that all law students obtain a legal internship during the summer after their first year, with participating employers accepting one law student or more selected by the program.Parkinson is an intern and Shlikas is a legal intern through MSPB's Sandy Brown Public Interest internship program.The paid internship program was established to honor MSPB's previous executive director Sandy Brown and is supported by individual donors and the Campbell Foundation.The donor-funded program provides undergraduate and law school students with a stipend while learning in the areas of public interest law, nonprofit management, community service and basic work experience.CLAY BENEDICTClay Benedict is a 2025 Juris Doctor candidate at the University of Baltimore School of Law.Born in Baton Rouge, he holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science from Louisiana State University, where he served as Secretary for the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity.Benedict served in the U.S. Army Infantry out of Fort Polk, Louisiana, working as a Battalion Property Manager and directly with the Commander.\"Working as an MSPB legal intern has been a humbling experience that has allowed me to interact with real people facing prevalent yet overlooked legal issues,\" Benedict said. \"Statistics, articles and just basic common knowledge about the disparity in legal aid and legal knowledge between those with resources and those without, is one thing; but here, I get to see those statistics unfold before my eyes, both inside and outside the courtroom.\" \"I decided to intern at MSPB because I was offered the opportunity to observe and learn firsthand the inner working procedures and processes, consequences, and defenses involved in a vast array of legal issues that affect everyday people,\" Benedict said. \"Whether it be representing tenants in rent court, helping draft wills, helping people overcome their debt, or helping people with internal family matters, there was something here for me to learn.\" Over the course of the summer, he has observed meetings between the attorneys and their clients in the realms of rent court hearings, estate planning and other family matters.Benedict also works part time at a personal injury firm, where he drafts complaints, interrogatories and case summaries, and where he conducts legal research for specific questions or trial related issues.Benedict said his work in the elder law clinic really stands out to him.\"Not only was it interesting and nice to get to meet so many people and hear their stories, but it was also very productive in terms of being able to assess someone's problem and then put it on a path of satisfactory resolution in the span of one simple meeting,\" Benedict said.\"So many people, when dealing with planning for their death or with the death or incapacitation of a family member, have no idea what is going on or what they need to do, so it's really fulfilling helping them work through these critical moments of their lives.\" With his sights set on graduating and passing the bar, Benedict has a flexible view of what legal field he might work in. \"I am not too concerned with respect to what kind of law I would like to practice, so long as I am able to conduct research, write, and argue in a stable, longterm setting,\" he said.JAMES PARKINSONJames Parkinson grew up in Easton and graduated from Easton High School in 2020. He is pursuing his Bachelor of Arts in Government and Politics with a minor in History from the University of Maryland, College Park, where his academic honors have earned him membership in the Pi Sigma Alpha National Political Science Honor Society.His academics earned him a Fall 2022 University Honors College Citation and acceptance into the Government and Politics Honors Program.Parkinson currently is serving as a Maryland General Assembly Intern and Legislative Assistant with Delegate Steven J. Arentz, and previously served as a District Office Intern and Legislative Assistant with Delegate Johnny Mautz. He is the captain and goalkeeper of the University of Maryland Club Soccer Team's red squad.\"Interning with Mid-Shore Pro Bono this summer has allowed me to work alongside dedicated legal professionals and attorneys, whose common goal of serving the Eastern Shore community has been a source of constant inspiration,\" Parkinson said. \"Through learning about our client intake process and helping with in-person clinics, I have gained a better understanding of the intricacies of legal work outside the courtroom. I have also been able to attend court proceedings with a dynamic team focused on housing justice on the Lower Shore.\" This summer, Parkinson has learned about three areas of law: elder, family and housing. He has found some of his duties, like doing intakes for new clients, are not specific to one area of law, but a bulk of his work corresponds to one of these three areas.Parkinson has helped in scheduling clients for our elder law clinics, and assisted MSPB volunteer attorneys as they draft wills and other legal documents, like power of attorney forms or advance medical directives. In the area of housing law, he has gone to court with the MSPB staff attorney and paralegal from the Salisbury office, helping tenants in rent court with a variety of legal issues. His experience in family law matters has mostly been doing intakes, connecting people to our network of volunteer attorneys.\"My experience in housing court has been the highlight of my summer experience. Prior to this internship, I had never seen the inside of a courtroom, and I now feel comfortable in the Dorchester and Wicomico District courthouses. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with our housing team as they represent clients in landlord versus tenant cases - they are dedicated to working towards greater housing justice on the Eastern Shore.\" Parkinson plans to attend law school after graduation.GABRIELLE SHLIKASGabrielle Shlikas is a 2025 J.D. candidate and a Christine A. Edwards Dean's Scholar at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. Her time at the Carey School of Law includes serving as a student member of the Administrative Committee, as an event moderator with the Business Association, as a student representative of the Admissions Office, and as a member of the Women's Bar Association.Shlikas graduated cum laude from Wellesley College with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and English, where she was a Tanner Conference speaker and graduated from the She Should Run Program. She is an Alumnae Member of The Wellesley Fund, having served as a Philanthropy Team Supervisor, Candidacy Exploration Researcher, and Residential Assistant.Shlikas received a diploma from the International Baccalaureate Program and additionally has served as a Senate Page with the Maryland General Assembly and as an Executive Board Member of the Maryland Youth Advisory Council.\"Working at MSPB has been an amazing experience - I've learned so much not only about the law itself but how to conduct myself as a legal professional,\" Shlikas said.\"With MSPB, I've had the privilege of helping those in my community through a variety of problems, questions, and situations.I wanted to be an MSPB Intern because I wanted to do work that directly impacted the area I call home, and doing so this summer has been extremely rewarding.\" After graduation, Shlikas anticipates working in business law, with an eventual goal of practicing family and divorce law.Shlikas described her work this summer as \"absolutely fantastic.\" \"There's been a lot of opportunity for me to get practical experience and see lawyers doing work.Some of the most informative experiences have been her weekly work in rent court, the legal venue for disputes between landlords and tenants, primarily regarding potential evictions. \"It's been amazing to see the amount of people who don't know that they have rights in the situation, or don't realize that there are a lot of ways their issue can be resolved without them being evicted.\" Shlikas has also worked with the expungement clinic, a service more in demand due to recent changes in state law about cannabis-related convictions.One impactful experience of the summer for Shlikas was helping a man get expungements on multiple convictions ranging back decades. The man told Shlikas the convictions had kept him from applying from certain types of jobs, and that he was excited about his expanded employment opportunities.Additionally, Shlikas found it rewarding to help tenants expecting to be evicted because they were with oldling their rent because of concerns with the liveability of the property they rented to find a resolution through the legal process that included those necessary improvements being made.\"It's been great to be exposed to all of these areas of law,\" Shlikas said.MID-SHORE PRO BONO INTERN OPPORTUNITIES\"We're honored to have Clay, James, and Gabrielle continuing their educations with us,\" said Mid-Shore Pro Bono Executive Director Meredith Lathbury Girard. \"We're also grateful for the University of Baltimore School of Law's EXPLOR program and especially for the donors to our Sandy Brown Public Interest Internship fund that help underwrite stipends for our interns.\" Girard said the nonprofit is uniquely positioned to expose students who are interested in the practice of law, social work and public interest work through hands-on experiences working with rural populations lacking the same resources as urban areas.\"This program engages students in a wide range of legal-related experiences in a high quality and well-supervised professional setting,\" she said. \"And undergraduate students interested in law, justice, and criminal justice as well as other civic-minded careers will be exposed to hands-on experience in these areas as well.\" Mid-Shore Pro Bono connects Eastern Shore individuals and families in need of legal representation with volunteer attorneys to ensure that all can have access to the assistance needed, with offices in Easton and Salisbury.

Considered by many to be a cornerstone of Plato's work, the dialogue explores two central questions: First, what is justice, and secondly, is the just person happier than the unjust person? or what is the relation of justice to happiness?Participants will explore these questions through guided discussions and selected readings. After Hansen's class on Meno last term, one student remarked, \"I learned as much from the participants and Forest, as Plato and Socrates!\" Hansen earned a BA in English at Harvard, an MA in English at the University of Wisconsin, and a Ph.D. in Philosophy at Johns Hopkins.For more than 35 years he taught a variety of courses in English and philosophy, as well as courses in Greek Civilization, Classics in Western Thought, and more.Plato's Republic is four-sessions, Wednesdays, Sept. 6, 13, 20 and 27, from 10 to 11:30 a.m. Cost: $40.Zoom only.If philosophy doesn't ring your bell, may birding will.

    "content": "Governor visits Benedictine\n\n August 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom Mccall; tmccall@chespub.com | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 857\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY - Gov. Wes Moore visited the Benedictine campus on Aug. 17. Although a phalanx of elected officials showed up, he seemed most enthused with the students he met. He even high-fived a couple and returned a \"peace out\" hand gesture in kind.He was joined by Maryland Department of Disabilities Secretary Carol Beatty.The campus was the governor's first stop through the Eastern Shore as he attended the annual Maryland Association of Counties summer conference.\"It was my privilege to visit Benedictine Programs and Services and witness firsthand the amazing work being done by the staff that is crucial to the success of our students,\" Moore said. \"The caring leadership of Director Scott Evans and Educational Director Julie Hickey aligns with our administration's mission to leave no one behind. I thank them for their admirable work toward this vital goal.\" Beatty believes strongly in the Benedictine mission.\"This is a critical organization for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in our state,\" Beatty said. \"A lot of the school systems look to a school like this for assistance and support for their students.They also have a very vibrant adult service program.So they are training people to work.\" Benedictine Programs and Services offers a year-round educational residential program for students throughout Maryland, ages 5-21, as well as adjoining states, and an expansion is set for the facility with the support of a $1.5 million capital grant in fiscal year 2023 budget.The funding will be used for the construction and engineering costs associated with building a new student residential building. The fiscal year 2024 capital budget included an additional $2.5 million for the campus project.\"It was an honor to host Gov. Moore at our campus in Ridgely. We had the opportunity to tour our facility, where the governor met students, teachers and our supported adults,\" Evans said.\"We thank the governor and his staff for taking the time to learn about what we do here at Benedictine in fulfilling our mission to help the individuals we support achieve their greatest potential and highest level of independence,\" he added.They took Moore into a classroom where two students were learning about pirates. The super-engaged teacher of functional academics was Leslie Nelson.The governor jumped right into the lesson and gave high fives for correct answers.One unscripted moment happened in a hallway when Moore approached two parents who had just left their son Jake off at Benedictine for his first time. Peggy was in tears, partly out of leaving her son and partly of gratitude to Benedictine for the \"golden ticket\" their family had received to enroll him.Moore consoled and celebrated with her and gave her a hug.Benedictine has students from 16 different counties and several states including Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia. Evans said most of the students from Maryland are publicly funded. Benedictine currently has room for 36 residential students on campus and is looking with the expansion to get to 48.\"A lot of what we get is what public schools can't handle. So we set up an environment so they can be safe as they are learning and we are helping them to manage those behaviors and learn new ways,\" Hickey said.\"That is really what our goal is. Last year we had 148 referrals, and we have taken 12.\" A tough issue is attracting the best teachers. One classroom had two students, one teacher and two assistants.It is intense and rewarding work that pays about as much as Applebee's. It is about as hard to get a placement as getting into an Ivy League college. One state-level fix is the service year option that could get younger workers involved with this meaningful work. Evans called this work life changing.Benedictine is a non-sectarian, non-religious nonprofit organization supporting close to 200 children and adults with developmental disabilities and autism to achieve their greatest potential and highest level of independence. Benedictine's year-round educational program is one of only 22 nationwide to earn a two-year accreditation from the National Commission for Accreditation of Special Education Services.Benedictine's Adult Services program offers employment and vocational services for transitional youth and adults, ages 22 to 70 and beyond, in the community and those who live in Benedictine's group homes in Caroline, Talbot and Anne Arundel counties. Benedictine is one of only four residential facilities for the developmentally disabled and autistic that can accept students with moderate to severe challenges.Benedictine is one of the Eastern Shore's largest employers with 350 employees. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY TOM MCCALL/TMCCALL@CHESPUB.COM\n \nGov.

    "content": "School lunches - yesterday and today\n\n August 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Marie Savage; The Country Cook | Page: A18 | Section: News \n \n 1204\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n School will be opening shortly and I decided to go back in time for that ever-important break in the school day - lunch. Everyone is \"starving\" by lunchtime especially the ones who had no breakfast.My mom had that big pot of oatmeal ready, and she made sure we had a bowl of it! I am exploring the 1940s when my older brothers and sister went to school. Mom always had at least three or more children in school and would pack their lunches.Lunches were packed in round tin pails with handles or the ever-popular generational brown bag. Their lunch would consist of a biscuit with a piece of meat or maybe a piece of cornbread with leftover meat from supper the night before.Water from school to drink, an apple or whatever was available and in season. When they got home from school there would be a snack consisting of fruit or leftovers from the night before.The 1940s-style cafeteria in the little Bishopville school was part of a six-room school consisting of four classrooms (two grades per room), two bathrooms (one male and one female), one multipurpose room - cafeteria-gym-auditorium-meeting room - and a storage room for everything from toilet tissue to chalk to cleaning supplies to canned goods! Then came the 1950s with changes to the school that included a large room converted to a cafeteria complete with a big cook stove, an actual cook, tables and chairs, but the room still converted to a gym, auditorium and meeting room.If you bought lunch, the food was placed on the ugliest dark brown, heavy plastic tray ever. No matter what food you were served that day there was a small dish of applesauce on the corner of the tray. The dessert was usually a small square of brownie, gingerbread, square of yellow sheet cake with frosting or a small bowl of Jello. The late Mrs. Lynch was our cook who lived locally and whose car was parked there every morning about 6 a.m. Mrs. Lynch and Mr. Hudson, the custodian, were employed there for many years. The only other part-timer was \"Albert,\" a local boy who helped peel vegetables, carry heavy pots, scrub down tables, whatever Mrs.Lynch needed help with, AND he ate lunch with us and pushed us on the swings! We all dearly loved the \"workers\" at our little country school!Attending this school from first grade through sixth, we packed lunches and occasionally bought lunch. Foods packed were usually leftovers from supper the night before.One popular sandwich was a meatloaf sandwich. It seemed no matter what the main sandwich was, the sides were always a fat dill pickle, a few chips, and a cookie with water. In the 1940s and '50s other popular packed lunches were potted meat, tuna fish, peanut butter and jelly, bologna and cheese sandwiches, any kind of leftover supper meat from the night before, and I cannot forget the popular Spam sandwich.On a cold wintry morning Mrs. Lynch would have several large pots of vegetable or bean soup cooking and the delicious aroma would travel all over the school. The only aroma that was better was the one of tomato soup and grilled cheese!Then came the late 1950s and the early 1960s! We left our little country school to go to the \"big school\" - high school - which for us was Stephen Decatur. Here we met up with many more \"city kids\" than ever. The country kids, the city kids all blended in together and compared our lifestyles. One thing we all had in common, we were starving at lunchtime! I must share this lunch story with you. Several girls and I became close friends and remained so for many years. \"Nellie\" was from Berlin, \"Sue\" was from Ocean City, \"Sandy\" was from St. Martins and then me from Bishopville.We sat at the same table every day and we usually packed lunch every day - usually consisting of leftovers from the night before. I had a meatloaf sandwich, Sandy had tuna fish, and Sue had lunch meat with cheese. We were busy chatting and eating when I looked over at Nellie, whose brown bag was stained on the outside. I asked Nellie \"what did you bring?\" Nellie said \"leftover fried beef tongue\" from last night - the three of us screamed, jumped up and ran gagging to the bathroom!Then came my children going to school in the 1970s and 1980s. School cafeterias had changed greatly by this time. In middle school there was a jukebox, round tables as well as the long style and a \"huge\" change in school food.Some lunches were spaghetti with meatballs, garlic bread and a salad. There were submarines with small bags of chips, and the ever popular \"a la carte\" foods. You could purchase candy bars, ice cream, individual sandwiches and add a bowl of soup. Lunch boxes turned into lunch bags or insulated bags.Packed lunches in the '80s and '90s included foods like beef jerky, cheese sticks, hot chips and pop-top cans of soups. Lunch had very few sandwiches as students would buy lunch on \"pizza days\" and \"taco days.\" Potato bars, taco bars, Lunchables, Chef Boyardee pop top cans, juice box drinks - all changed the landscape of lunch time.Schools started serving breakfast, lunch and afternoon snacks.Since my parents operated a store in town for a few years, we usually saw the families that would come in and \"buy on credit,\" which usually wasn't much. Flour, corn meal, bacon and maybe sugar when the crops were good. I was taught to help. I saw my mother for years on Sundays feed many hungry neighbors who maybe hadn't eaten for a few days. She'd pick tomatoes or corn from her garden and leave them on doorsteps. If we had it, our less fortunate neighbors also had it and vice versa. I miss those days.Now we are exploring school lunches from 2000 to 2023. Most schools are now offering two or three different lunch choices and that ever so popular a la carte menu.As I close this column today, I realize going back in time brings back so many memories of my school years! From the bus drivers - mostly men who lived locally, had local jobs, were farmers, members of our local fire department and who attended our small church. So, hiding mischief was a \"no go\" as one glance of their eyes meant \"momma and poppa\" run the local store and I will be stopping by there after the morning run! Our cafeteria \"ladies\" were mostly locals from our small town, and they cooked like \"mom.\" Our two teachers and one principal-teacher were from Ocean City and owned a hotel where several students' families worked. A community park is now in the spot where Bishopville Elementary School once stood. As I look at where the school once stood, I am flooded with memories.No matter what type of lunch bag or box you carried, no matter what kind of biscuit or bread you used, and no matter what kind of filling was on that sandwich, we were all the same children from a small town!Those sandwiches were all the same - peanut butter with jelly or jam or honey. Eskay bologna and cheese or Spam and mustard. Leftover meatloaf or a piece of leftover fried chicken. Tuna fish or a piece of bread wrapped around a cold piece of leftover fried tongue - that was for you Nellie!Have a wonderful 2023-2024 school year y'all! \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Maari's mother participated in the 4-H Development Program for Youth 35 years ago, visiting Illinois at age 15 - the same age as Maari.Tina Squibb, faculty member of the University of Maryland Extension program and host mom to Maari, has two daughters close to Maari's age and said it has been a wonderful experience for the whole family to get to know her.\"Maari was asked by the mayor of her city to present to local leadership (in Queen Anne's County) and she would like to read a letter from the mayor to the Commission,\" Squibb said.The letter from Ishi Toshiro, mayor of Nishinomiya, said the town \"is known as the cultural, educational and residential city.\" Residents of Nishinomiya (population 484,000) are flanked by the Rokko mountain range and the Osaka Bay. Toshiro closed his letter by saying, \"Young people dream big dreams and are filled with enthusiasm to make them happen,\" and thanked the commission for the opportunity for Maari to share a bit of her culture.Maari then presented the commissioners with several gifts from Japan and read a story called \"The Sky Blue Seed.\" Dr. Jinhee Kim, associate dean/associate director of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, attended as well.\"Students in the 4-H program from Maryland are visiting other countries and there are currently 10 Japanese students visiting Maryland,\" Kim said.Maryland 4-H partners provide students with the opportunity to travel to foreign countries for a cultural immersion experience. Delegates live with volunteer host families and engage in experiential learning about a new way of life. The intention of the program is for students' experiences to deepen their understanding of their host culture as well as their own. \n \n Caption: Maari Murakawa, 15, and her host \"sibling\" Jamie Squibb, 16, enjoy a night of music and dinner at Doc's Riverside Grill in Centreville.\n \nCOURTESY OF TINA SQUIBB \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It sure feels like it.I just read that as a nation, we will spend $41.5 billion getting our kids outfitted to go back to school this fall. And by outfitted I mean with all the \"proper\" electronic gear, shoes with all the bells and whistles (I would like a pair of those sneakers with little wheels embedded in the soles), backpacks, instruments and of course the ever-popular school supplies.Yikes! That's a whole lotta money.Granted, I don't have school-aged children anymore, but come on! The average elementary schooler's must-haves in school supplies, extracurricular fees and technology this year comes in at $1,017; for middle school students, it's $1,277; and for high school kids, $1,668 each, according to the 13th annual Backpack Index survey from Huntington Bank in Columbus, Ohio.Spreading the cost over the school year seems more reasonable to me, unless it's notebook paper, pens and paper. Those are so cheap right now at office supply stores, you really should stock up for the entire year.And while we're on the subject, let's throw fundraisers into the discussion.Every year about this time I get a flood of messages that are some variation of, \"I am so sick of my kids bringing home catalogs full of cheap, overpriced stuff that the school expects us to sell. How can we deal with this? I'd love some advice and insight on how other parents do it.\" So, how do you deal with school supplies, outfits and fundraisers?

    "content": "Students paying less for college than 15 years ago\n\n August 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George F. Will | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 757\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - From sea to shining sea, the shining faces of young people are turning expectantly toward another year in the groves of academe. Heading for college, they leave behind parents who might understandably be bewildered about the price of higher education.(Higher than what?It's complicated, and a question for another day.)There is ample evidence that colleges mangle the truth about so many subjects (e.g., history, contemporary life, how literature should be studied, freedom of expression on campuses, etc.) that it should not surprise anyone that the counterintuitive reality about tuition is deliberately obscured - and cunningly complicated.Fortunately, Dan Currell has entertainingly dispelled the manufactured mists that engulf \"The Truth about College Costs,\" which is the title of his astringent essay in the summer issue of National Affairs. Formerly a senior adviser at the Education Department, Currell has glad tidings: \"Students are paying less for college than they did 15 years ago.\" This is, as Currell knows, \"deeply contrary to conventional wisdom,\" but the reason for it is hiding in plain sight: \"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, colleges discovered that the appearance of high tuition was good for marketing.\" Since then, they have toiled to keep \"nearly invisible\" the fact that 96 percent of students pay about $15,000 a year for tuition.Add $10,000 for room and board, and the $25,000 total is a far cry from the eye-watering numbers that colleges are actually pleased to have bandied about.A few highly selective colleges educate a \"small and highly unrepresentative\" fraction of students. \"The top 100 private schools enroll around 500,000 students,\" while the other 2,600 four-year schools enroll about 10.5 million.Most of the elite schools could fill their annual enrollments several times over with the children of the affluent who would gladly pay the advertised tuition - even much more. Most of these elite institutions have, however, large endowments that enable generous tuition assistance for the less affluent. For the other 2,500 institutions, a sleight of hand is the basic business practice.The Economist largely validates Currell's thesis. It reports that the average tuition paid by students at their home-state public colleges is about $10,000, and that private colleges discount tuition by more than 50 percent on average. \"The College Board, a non-profit, shows that whereas published tuition and fees for private nonprofit colleges increased from $29,000 in 2006-07 to $38,000 in 2021-22 (in 2021 dollars), the net price actually decreased from $17,000 to $15,000. The story is similar for public colleges. Published tuition and fees were nearly $8,000 in 2006-07 and rose to nearly $11,000 in 2021-22, but the net cost fell by $730.\" But, the Economist says, schools have \"an incentive to seem extortionate:\" \"Consumers tend to associate higher prices with higher quality.\" (Currell: \"Bowdoin's published tuition today is $4,000 higher than Harvard's.\") The Economist adds, \"students (and their boastful parents) are flattered by tuition markdowns pitched as merit scholarships rather than discounts.\" The discounts often are, Currell says, \"institutional scholarships\" with no money behind them. \"By 1999,\" he says, \"the fundamental dishonesty of college pricing had become clear\": \"That year, American private colleges purported to award scholarships worth more than all the tuition they collected - which is to say, their average discount had exceeded 50%.\" That explains this faux mystery: Colleges ostensibly cost $50,000 a year, \"but,\" Currell says drolly, \"they are somehow also running out of money.\" The not at all mysterious reality is, Currell says, that \"the apparent rise in tuition after the mid-1990s\" is \"almost entirely illusory.\" \"In fact,\" Currell says, \"if a typical college collected its sticker price in full, its leaders would hardly know what to do with all the money.\" For example, Beloit College, a Wisconsin liberal arts school with a $43 million budget, would have an extra $26 million.Colleges can minimize their discounts by instead steering parents toward having government provide the discount with subsidized student loans.Among the social costs of what Currell calls the \"fundamental dishonesty\" about college pricing is today's mountain of college debt: \"Many families simply believe there is a $200,000 tollbooth on the road to the American dream, so they sign the loan forms.\" Academia has appointed itself the nation's moral tutor whose duty is to make Americans remorseful about almost everything, including deceptive practices that the tutor insists characterize unsavory capitalism. So, it is fun to have Currell's demonstration that our supposed moral betters have practices that are, to use one of their favorite words, problematic.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nNew graduates line up before the start of a community college commencement in 2018 \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No application is needed.\"This is a wonderful program for our county with having over 3,000 of our students on free meals already and a significant amount of our students missed the free threshold by being over the income level by $50,\" said Beth Brewster, supervisor of food services for the school district.Caroline County school cafeterias will still charge for extra items like snacks. Families should continue to register with MySchoolBucks to pay for extra items in the cafeteria or school activities as directed.According to the USDA website, the Community Eligibility Provision is a non-pricing meal service option for schools and school districts in low-income areas.CEP allows the nation's highest poverty schools and districts to serve breakfast and lunch at no cost to all enrolled students without collecting household applications.Instead, schools that adopt the program are reimbursed using a formula based on the percentage of students eligible for free meals based on their participation in other means-tested programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.\"To qualify for CEP a district has to have 40% of their free (meal) students directly certified by the state that they are free,\" Brewster wrote in an Aug. 28 email.\"When qualifying for free meals through the application process the gross salary is the income that is taken, not the net.\" \"Last year, CCPS had close to a 66% free and reduced rate for school meals. Dorchester and Somerset have been CEP for a few years,\" she wrote.\"Some districts have a few schools that qualify so they may have a few schools within the district that are CEP not the whole district. We will have districtwide CEP,\" Brewster wrote.\"We have had very sad stories of families having medical issues or trouble paying rent or their mortgage that did not qualify,\" Brewster said. \"This makes it an even playing field for our children to have access to nutritious meals that allows them to develop their gray brain matter and come to school ready to learn.\" \"No child should be hungry or wonder where their next meal is coming from,\" she said.CCPS Food Services supports local farmers and businesses in its quest to provide local products.According to the Caroline County Public Schools website, each summer Food Services personnel \"process locally sourced produce to utilize throughout the school year. Not only is it good for local businesses, it is great for the environment and more nutritious for our students.\" For more information about the USDA's Community Eligibility Provision program, visit fns-prod. azureedge.us/sites/default/files/cn/CEPfactsheet.pdf.For more information about CCPS Food Services, call 410-479-3261 or visit www.carolineschools.org/o/ccps/page/food-services. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I am gratified that thanks to the hard work of our entire team and the generosity of our scores of supporters, we have done just that: We have received $1.75 million from the state of Maryland, the federal government and the town of St. Michaels; more than $1.5 million in donations from individuals; and $750,000in major foundation grants. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nSt. Michaels Community Center Executive Director Patrick Rofe stands at the front entrance of the center's building now under major renovations.

    "content": "University of Maryland Eastern Shore increases enrollment once again\n\n September 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A12 | Section: News \n \n 712\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n PRINCESS ANNE - The University of Maryland Eastern Shore will have a third consecutive year of increased new student enrollment and is on pace to surpass the largest influx of freshmen and transfer students in eight years.In the fall of 2022, 733 new undergraduate students were enrolled at UMES, which was shy of the 1,011 students who came to Princess Anne at the start of the 2015 school year.\"Currently, we have 825 new students enrolled, and we continue to push the needle to welcome in as many students as we're capable of serving,\" said Latoya Jenkins, UMES's vice president of enrollment management and student experience.\"I think that ultimately we'll surpass the largest class we had in 2015, but we still have work to do to ultimately see where we will end up,\" she said.The increased enrollment numbers at UMES are following a national trend which has seen continual new student growth at Historically Black Colleges and Universities since 2020.The drive to increase enrollment has been one of the initiatives driven by President Heidi M. Anderson since the return to campus following the pandemic. Jenkins said President Anderson challenged them to not only to continue to increase enrollment, but also enhance retention efforts, which has seen a 10 percent uptick.As part of the mission to raise student enrollment, the admissions and recruitment department has worked on strategies to not only raise awareness of the UMES brand to students and parents, but strengthen connections with stakeholders according to Darryl Isom, director of admissions and recruitment.\"I've been here about two years, and when I initially came on board, the determination was that the UMES brand really needed to be defined,\" Isom said. \"We needed to get a unified message into the community, into our feeder schools, and into the nation of what we really are about, our unique programs, our family atmosphere, and how we have all the resources of a research institution but the feel of a very small liberal arts school and that has really resonated.\" Isom also attributes the gains to the outstanding work of his admissions and recruitment staff, which continues to expand.\"We're seeing the benefits of that where our name, our brand, our name recognition is really growing locally as we had to re-penetrate and reinforce our mission locally with our local market, nationally, and even internationally to a certain extent,\" he said. \"My team has gotten out there and really told the story of UMES and what a really wonderful institution this is. So that has been very instrumental in the pivot that we did initially in terms of our recruiting strategy.\" That recruiting strategy includes the use of a regional ad campaign through Baltimore-based tbc Inc., targeting the New York City, Philadelphia, Norfolk and Atlanta, Salisbury and the Baltimore/Washington D.C. markets. In addition to the campaign, UMES partnered with consulting firms such as Ruffalo Noel Levitz geared to helping UMES create best practices for enrollment management.Recruiting isn't the only focus. There is also an emphasis on registering transfer students, which include junior and community college graduates. So far, an estimated 200 transfer students are expected to make their way to Princess Anne.Jenkins said as a result of partnerships with institutions including Wor-Wic Community College, UMES has been able to share its stories and information about the rate of success students with two-year degrees have at the university.\"When students transfer from Wor-Wic to UMES, they do better and graduate in less time to complete their four-year degree,\" she said. \"That's not something UMES or Wor-Wic made up, that's baked in our data from the national clearinghouse.\" As the student population and campus community continues to grow and new academic courses are unveiled such as the new online and continuing education programs, Jenkins said one of the long-term goals is to return enrollment numbers back to pre-pandemic levels, something which is not out of the realm of possibility, but will involve continual progress.\"We have talked about charting the heights of our enrollment that was, in 2017, upwards of the times which we had around 4,000 students,\" she said. \"I think that coming out of a pandemic and where our institution is, we are poised to grow, but it will take us some time to get back to those numbers.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bullying lawsuit in Dorchester County Court\n\n September 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: A3 | Section: News \n \n 620\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - A jury trial is underway in an extensive lawsuit alleging negligence from Dorchester County Public Schools administrators and teachers in handling bullying and harassment of a former Mace's Lane Middle School student.Filed in Dorchester County Circuit Court in May 2018, the lawsuit alleges negligence from faculty and staff at the middle school while a former student was experiencing numerous instances of bullying, harassment and assault.Defendants named in the complaint include the Dorchester County Board of Education; James Bell, DCPS supervisor of student services; Cynitha Woolford, assistant principal at Mace's Lane Middle School; Michael Collins, former principal of Mace's Lane Middle School; and two unnamed substitute teachers.Court filings allege that the six defendants encouraged and covered up the behavior, and directly participated in the harassment and bullying by punishing plaintiff Sierra Gambrill \"without cause or due process.\" The conduct in question occurred when Gambrill was in sixth grade during the 2016-2017 school year.The plaintiffs in the case - Gambrill and her parents - said that Gambrill experienced bullying and assault from multiple students at the middle school, including hair pulling, name calling, hitting and other physical attacks, over the course of the year.Some attacks against Gambrill increased in severity as the year progressed, plaintiffs said.In October 2016, Gambrill was in a science class with a substitute teacher when two male classmates physically beat her head and body. Gambrill rushed to Woolford's office to report the attack, but the assistant principal sent Gambrill home without ensuring that she received medical treatment. Gambrill sustained a concussion from that incident, the plaintiffs asserted.The Gambrill family reported the attack to Collins, but said that Collins told them that substitute teachers are not trained well, cannot control the classroom and that \"boys will be boys,\" according to a statement of facts filed by the plaintiffs.A second violent incident occurred in a science class on Dec. 14, 2016, while students were under the supervision of another substitute teacher.Plaintiffs said Gambrill was attacked by another male student, who grabbed her neck and flipped her backward, causing her to strike her head. Gambrill suffered another concussion from the attack.The plaintiffs said the second substitute teacher witnessed the attack and allowed it to happen \"without any intervention.\" The same student who assaulted Gambrill on Dec. 14 struck her in the face on Dec. 19, 2016, while both were at the nurse's office, plaintiffs said.Gambrill attempted to defend herself by pushing the student away, but was never given an opportunity to tell her side of the story.Plaintiffs said that Woolford failed to investigate the incident and \"immediately\" handed Gambrill a two-day out-of-school suspension as punishment.Attorneys for the family said that the defendants \"exacted unjustified discipline\" on Gambrill that year through suspensions, denying her attendance on school trips and requiring her to sit alone at lunch. Woolford reportedly harassed Gambrill by sending her home to change clothes, according to the court filing.Plaintiffs assert that the defendants failed to properly address the family's concerns for Gambrill's safety and failed to properly supervise and train substitute teachers.In June 2019, a judge in Dorchester County Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts that remained, including the negligence claim.The Gambrill family appealed the circuit court's ruling on the negligence claim in July 2019. About two years later, the Appellate Court of Maryland affirmed the lower court's ruling.The Gambrill family filed a second appeal to the Supreme Court of Maryland shortly after. But last August, the state's highest court reversed both lower rulings and remanded the case back to Dorchester County for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.The trial is expected to conclude Friday, according to court records. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY CHRISTINA AU FDERHEIDE \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Board members asked questions about how the schools plan to track progress, address staffing vacancies and what things the board and community can do to help the schools reach their goals.Throughout the rest of the meeting, board members asked questions, initiated conversations and probed deeper about many of the meeting's agenda items.At the end of the meeting, board member Theresa Stafford gave her hopes for the school year.\"I hope that as we move forward as a board, the community does not have to guess where we are and where we're going,\" she said.\"This year we will be transparent in everything we do.\" Stafford said conversations are healthy and that hard conversations need to happen.\"One of the first things in moving forward,\" she said, \"(is) we have to be realistic.And we may not paint a rosy picture that everybody this year is going to sit here and smile and agree.\" Stafford said that, as board members, listening to the community and supporting teachers is vital.\"We are the voice of the people who elected us to make sure that we are doing the best we can for the kids we have and for the community that we serve,\" she said.Board member Chris Wheedleton said he's excited about making data-driven decisions this school year. He said there a plans for a new dashboard that will show whether progress on student outcomes is being made in the district.\"We're putting ourselves to account and making sure that we can really report where we're seeing progress,\" he said.Wheedleton also talked about the importance of having civil and constructive conversations as a board. He said that this can go handin-hand with data-driven decision making.\"I think that's an important message for our kids to hear as we go back into school as well - that civility and data can actually go together,\" he said. \"It's all about us looking at the data and then making really smart decisions about what we do.\" School Board President Susan Morgan said it's going to take collaboration to effect change.\"There's no reason that Dorchester County can't be the best county on the Eastern Shore for education,\" she said. \"To do that though, we need a little bit more help.We need help from parents, guardians, grandparents, anyone who has a child in our system.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nDorchester County Board of Education Member Theresa Stafford speaks during a Board of Education meeting Aug. 17 in Cambridge.\n \nMAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nDorchester County Board of Education Member Chris Wheedleton speaks during a Board of Education meeting Aug. 17 in Cambridge. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Audits show trouble lurking in school contracts\n\n September 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Kayla Nazaire; Capital News Service | Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 929\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Auditors keep a close eye on school district contracting in Maryland - and if you're wondering why, just look at what happened in May in Montgomery County.After auditors raised suspicions, the district's former assistant director of transportation pleaded guilty to stealing over $320,000 from the county's school system over a span of at least five years by misusing district purchasing cards and mismanaging a contract for the purchase of school buses.What's more, several state audits in recent years raised serious questions about contract spending in other Maryland public school districts.Richard P. Henry, Maryland's inspector general for education, acknowledged the possibility that officials in other school districts could be misusing the school contracting system.\"You know, we don't find out all the time, but there will always be some individuals who will take advantage of flaws in the system, and you know, possibly profit from it or use it to their advantage,\" Henry said.County or district officials frequently audit local school districts in Maryland.On top of that, the state Office of Legislative Audits reviews the books of each school district once every six years, whereas the Maryland Office of the Inspector General for Education takes complaints from the public and investigates them.But audits, while helpful, can only identify problems. It is up to the districts to implement solutions - and often they don't. The Office of Legislative Audits released an audit of the Maryland State Department of Education in January. Auditors found 171 repeated findings that local school systems had yet to address from previous audits.Matthew Streett, assistant director of the Compliance and Performance Audit Division in the Office of Legislative Audits, said school districts should take audit findings seriously.\"I think it's important to safeguard the assets because ultimately, when you're talking about money that flows through the school system, it's all intended to help educate the students, and if money is being diverted, it's less money that's intended for the classroom and students,\" Streett said.Public school districts in Montgomery County, Baltimore City, Howard County, Charles County and Calvert County have all been audited in recent years. Concerns raised in those audits range from unauthorized transactions to insufficient documentation to justify major purchases.In addition, the audits found that nearly every school district failed to complete proper documentation for approval of intergovernmental purchasing agreements. In many cases, employees made purchases without documenting why they were necessary and beneficial to the district.Here's a detailed look at what auditors and investigators found in recent years in those individual school districts: MONTGOMERY COUNTYAuditors have found a number of issues with school district contracting in Montgomery County, but none more serious than the one that led to guilty pleas from two district transportation department officials this year.In May, Charles Ewald, the district's former assistant transportation director, pleaded guilty to one count of felony theft and one misdemeanor count of misconduct in office.Court records said Ewald used his position to request checks from an \"off-the-books\" account held by one of the district's longtime bus vendors, American Truck & Bus Inc. The money came from late fee and change fee reimbursements owed to the district - and, according to court documents, $352,568.68 of it went directly to Ewald's bank account. In addition, Ewald had the bus vendor issue about $16,000 in checks to other school district staff members.Todd Watkins, the former director of the transportation department, pleaded guilty in June to one count of misconduct in office, and not just because he failed to fulfill his role of overseeing the department's expenses. Watkins was the one who coordinated with American Truck & Bus to establish the \"offthe-books\" account, court records said.Watkins received more than $13,000 using the account and intentionally violated the district's reimbursement policy, but he provided documentation for those payments and was not charged with theft.A judge will sentence Ewald and Watkins in September, closing a criminal case that began with an internal review in 2021.Then last December, the Montgomery County Office of the Inspector General found that school district transportation department officials used school funds to pay for a NASCAR headset, drag racing tires, a sport loop band for an Apple Watch, a car roof rack for kayaks, Home Depot and Amazon gift cards, along with other personal items. The purchases totaled nearly $5,000.In response to the audit, Montgomery County Public Schools officials confirmed all the findings were factually accurate and outlined procedures they planned to implement to correct the problems.CALVERT COUNTYThe state Office of Legislative Audits reported in January 2022 that Calvert County Public Schools took shortcuts in the spending approval process and failed to monitor whether their vendors were billing them correctly.The lack of oversight on the district's financial systems allowed individual departments and schools to make purchases while skipping necessary procurement processes, auditors said.Auditors raised questions about the district's transportation costs. Compared to other comparable-sized districts, Calvert County schools paid 22 cents per mile more for transportation.In addition, the district paid over a half-million dollars in bus operations fees without providing any reasonable justification for these transportation costs.On other contracts, the district didn't check to see if the price written on the invoice from vendors matched the pricing agreed to in the contract. The audit found five payments in intergovernmental contract agreements that added up to $642,000 that were vaguely detailed or had different product descriptions.Calvert County Public Schools accepted the audit results and said it would address the issues. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nBuses prepare for departure from Easton Elementary after the first day of school in 2022. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That's because money is about values, relationships, choices and self-worth.And while teaching your kids important values to guide their lives is of the utmost importance, when all is said and done those values are more likely to be caught than taught.You have to live what you teach.If there is one thing that will ruin your kids' lives, it's greed. Teach them while they're young how to pull the drain plug on greed, and you will have prepared them in a very important way to not only survive, but to also thrive in the real world.The antidote for greed is giving away part of the three T's - your time, your talent and your treasure. Everyone, no matter how young or poor, possesses all three.Time: You get 24 hours every day, 10,080 minutes or 604,800 seconds every week.Talent: This is what you can do. Everyone has special talents, things they are good at doing.Treasure: This is what you have, your possessions. It's your money, and also your toys, clothes, collections - everything that you own.Are you bewildered? If you have never been a \"giver\" it may seem quite odd for me to suggest you should just give away any of your time or your stuff. But that is exactly what I mean.If you want to make sure you are never defeated by greed, learn to be a giver.When you give to others it helps you to be grateful for what you have. Giving is the way to stop feeling sorry for yourself. Instead of misery, you feel joy. In place of dissatisfaction you find contentment.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Representative from both organizations and the Town of Goldsboro set up by the old railroad station. In less than 2 hours, 110 backpacks filled with supplies like notebooks, rulers, pens and pencils, and other items necessary for successful academic learning, were distributed to children and families.This year the Town of Goldsboro got involved by donating money toward the supplies and providing crafts and activities for kids to do to get them in the back-to-school mindset.\"We wanted to get involved this year because we could see the real need in our community and are always looking for more ways to reach out to our residents and help them with resources,\" said Jeannette DeLude, town manager of Goldsboro.\"The town is so happy that CASA of Caroline and Caroline Pride have brought this event to our town. The North County area is often overlooked, and we, the town and its council, are thrilled that we can help families in need in this part of Caroline County and encourage everyone to also come out for our Fall Fest on Oct. 7 in the same location,\" she said.This is the third year these two agencies have brought school supplies to the northern part of the county.Amy Horne, executive director at CASA of Caroline, said, \"We know that the kids our program serves are involved with multiple systems - the court system, the child welfare system, the health care system, and the school system. As a result, returning to school can be difficult and unpredictable.Our goal is not only to advocate for kids in the courtroom but also in the classroom. By ensuring the children in our community have all the supplies they need to learn and perform in the classroom, we are setting them up for success.\" Having a backpack and school supplies on the first day of school is important for young scholars to feel like they fit in with their peers. Students who feel they fit in at school are more likely to participate in school activities, have friends, perform better academically and have good mental health.\"As a member of a vulnerable population that is targeted by bullies, I know what it's like to feel left out.I don't want any kid in Caroline County to start their school year feeling left out because they didn't have a backpack or any supplies on their first day of school,\" said Angel Perez, CEO of Caroline Pride.Ashley Powell from Greensboro Elementary helped pack the backpacks.Numerous businesses and individuals donated items and money to make the program a success.\"I'm so proud to be a part of this community that gives back to those in need,\" Perez said.\"Yes, it's a community effort, and we're all responsible for keeping our eyes on kids and making sure they have what they need to feel safe, set up for success, and to thrive,\" Horne said. \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nCASA of Caroline and Caroline Pride gave away more than a hundred backpack for a back to school effort in the northern part of Caroline County. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The meeting, according to Chesapeake College President Cliff Coppersmith, is an opportunity to get the project \"to the next level\" by getting it put on a state list of capital projects.The state has agreed to pay for 75% of the capital project.With these letters of intent, each county would agree to providing local funds for the other 25%. In an email, Coppersmith said that once state funding has been allocated and approved, each supporting county would need to pass appropriations to fund the local share of the capital project.The facility would be more than 90,000 square feet. Of that total, 52,000 square feet would be assignable space. Currently, construction is set for 2026. The center will be located next to the Eastern Shore Higher Education Center.\"Our problem right now is we've got so much equipment crammed in these spaces, there's not a lot of room for students,\" Coppersmith said of the current Queen Anne's Technical Building during the meeting.According to meeting documents from a Queen Anne's County Commissioners meeting Sept. 12, the new facility \"will house programs such as electrical, welding, HVAC, culinary, skilled office/administrative support and marine and construction trades training.\" Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian chaired the meeting between counties Monday evening. Fithian said that while the new facility would be great to have on the Eastern Shore, Kent County does have concerns about the financial aspect of the project.Caroline County Commission Vice President Larry Porter said the cost of building the new facility is what strikes him most.\"I would really like to have a little bit more information about where that number is coming from,\" he said.Coppersmith said the estimated cost includes furnishing the building. He added that the equipment is not a part of that estimate.\"Existing equipment that's useable and still in date, we would just move into the new facility and obviously we would raise money - private funding, public grants, etc.- to upgrade our equipment once we get the building built and we're ready to move in,\" Coppersmith said.Queen Anne's County Commissioner Jack Wilson Jr. acknowledged that the price of the project is a concern, but said he feels confident they will be able to receive more money from the state for the project.Later in the meeting, Wilson said that the Queen Anne's County Commissioners had already voted last week in favor of providing letter of intent.Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said Dorchester County would have to vote against sending a letter of intent at this time. Pfeffer acknowledged that it is a \"great project\" but said that fiscal responsibilities in the county are keeping them from being able to send a letter of intent. Pfeffer said Dorchester County commissioners would be willing to send a letter of support for the project without a binding fiscal commitment.Fithian said each county is going to have to make its decision individually.\"We're all going to have to sit down with our finance office and really see what we can do,\" he said.During the meeting there were talks of possibly submitting a letter, signed by all five counties, detailing the benefits of having this new facility in order to obtain addition funding from the state.Toward the end of the meeting, Talbot County Council member Keasha Haythe said she will be voting in favor of Talbot County submitting a letter of intent.\"As a Chesapeake College alum, I believe it's very necessary and needed,\" she said. \"And considering how the labor force is doing a dive right now, this labor force is needed. We definitely have to be forward thinking to be able to accommodate the future needs of our children and those that are in high school currently.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tyranny Of The Loud At Washington College\n\n September 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: David Reel | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 709\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With great shock and even greater sadness, I read media accounts of protestors disrupting a recent presentation at Washington College in Chestertown.The presentation featured Dr.Robert George, the McCormick professor of jurisprudence and director of the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions at Princeton University.While Professor George has deeply held conservative beliefs which he does not shy away from expressing, he is also a frequent conversation partner with Cornel West, a progressive professor and political activist. They have appeared together at colleges and universities around the country, arguing for civil dialogue and a broad conception of campus freedom of speech as essential to the truth-seeking mission of academic institutions.Of his longtime friend West has said: \"Robby and I struggle over many issues, but at the deepest human level, it's hard to find anyone with his kind of integrity and genuine concern for others.\"Progressive Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan has said this about Professor George: \"He is one of the nation's most respected legal theorists and the respect he has gained is due to his sheer brilliance, the analytic power of his arguments, the range of his knowledge, a deeply principled conviction and a profound and enduring integrity.\"No stranger to threats of bodily harm, Professor George was once targeted with death threats for views on abortion.So how was Professor George treated during his presentation at Washington College? Extremely poorly is an understatement.The protesters at his presentation did not quietly carry signs and engage in civil dialogue with Professor George following his remarks. Instead, media at the event reported the following: \"The protesters marched in, with campus security allowing them passage.Shouting from the protesters started right away, breaking up the professor's talk.\"The media reported the protesters waved flags, waved signs, blew whistles, played music and danced. They did not stand down until Professor George's presentation ended prematurely, and he [George] was escorted from the room.After this shameful treatment Professor George observed that in all his years visiting numerous colleges and universities including Berkeley, Yale and Harvard (hardly bastions of conservatism), he never had this happen before.After this event, he observed that \"when intimidation works, they'll continue to do it.\"Indeed, they will. Intimidation at this event did work, and there is no reason to believe the protestors will not do it again with anyone who does not embrace their views or asks them to consider other views.That being the case the following questions need to be addressed by the leadership of Washington College.What has been or will be the college's response to the protestors willful disregard for the following Washington College core values?\"We share these values of our founding patron, George Washington: integrity, determination, curiosity, civility, leadership, and moral courage. We develop in our students' habits of analytic thought and clear communication, aesthetic insight, ethical sensitivity and civic responsibility.What has been or will be the college's response to the following comment by one protestor at the event after an email was sent to all students reminding them that it would be a violation of the Student Honor Code to disrupt a speaker?\"Are you going to tell me that WAC (Washington College) can expel every single one of us?Absolutely (expletive) not!\" Why did campus security decide not to intervene with timely and appropriate steps to deal with the protesters well before their disruptive behavior resulted in a premature end of the event?Post event a college spokesperson said, \"The protesters took issue with homophobic and transphobic statements that Professor George has made in the past.\"Is the spokesperson implying that Washington College agrees with the protester's interpretations of and opinions on statements made by Professor George in the past? How committed is Washington College to free speech, civil discourse and ensuring students are exposed to a wide range of views that may challenge how they think and what they think?One can hope that going forward Washington College will walk their talk on their core principles and student honor code to help ensure this recent tyranny of the loud will never happen again. \n \n Caption: WILL BONTRA GER\n \nRobert P.

    "content": "'Fantastic job this summer' - Summer school program to expand next year\n\n September 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 15 | Section: News \n \n 919\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - Based on the success of the 2023 summer education program and continued grant funding, Caroline County Public Schools' leaders are aiming to teach 400 more students next year.Presenting statistics and anecdotal comments about the program at the Sept. 5 meeting of the Board of Education, Lindsey McCormick, director of College and Career Readiness, gave \"huge shout-outs and kudos\" to the 75 certified teachers, 15 instructional assistants and seven site coordinators who \"chose to give up portions of their summer and continue to work with our students.\" Instructional assistants also received additional training this year.Caroline County School Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons praised McCormick's leadership.\"Lindsey has done a fantastic job.Her team has done a fantastic job this summer, he said. \"This (report) is an absolute testament to that.\"McCormick said 100 Caroline County Recreation and Parks staff helped with the 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. elementary summer camp called Jurassic Jamboree, which attracted 50 more students this year than in 2022.\"They're a tremendous partner,\" she said.The summer lessons and activities were designed for elementary, middle and high school students, with special programs for students with disabilities and multilingual learners.McCormick said the five-week time frame for summer programming was essentially the same as last year's, running from June 23 to July 27. Altogether, 916 students participated.Elementary students numbered 747 and attended sessions at four elementary schools (Federalsburg was closed for renovations). The average attendance was 14 days of the 19-day program.Participating in the elementary programming were 70 multilingual learners, 49 of whom attend Greensboro Elementary School.In the morning, students participated in both Reading Eggs and Moving with Math or Agile Mind; the Agile Mind math program was introduced for fifth grade students. When the teachers left, students had lunch, and in the afternoon, Recreation and Parks staff led enrichment activities.Secondary students attended only morning sessions. McCormick said one of the goals was to \"boost our middle school program.\"\"We raised our numbers to 40 students, and I was thrilled with that,\" she said. She praised after-school coordinator Deja Thompson for implementing what McCormick envisioned.\"Our middle school students had 45 minutes a day where they could rotate through, by choice, some CTE (Career and Technology Education) mini-sessions,\" McCormick said, adding that \"one of the large pushes\" in the Blueprint For Maryland's Future is more career exploration starting in middle school through high school.McCormick added comments from both teachers and parents to her PowerPoint presentation. One parent noted, \"My seventh grade son didn't want to 'give up' his summer but over the course of five weeks, he only missed three days. He was extremely excited about the CCTC programs he was able to see.\"\"I thought it was just great that our students had the opportunity to be exposed to some of our different CTE programs,\" she said. \"The CTE teachers themselves came to the middle schools to do that.\"Middle school students attended a tri-county, career enrichment day in Dorchester County that McCormick called \"amazing.\"Simmons explained the that Dorchester program is funded by the Mid-Shore Regional Council and is led by People for Change, \"an organization out of Prince George's County of largely minority business owners and professionals who run STEM sessions.\"High school students were offered summer \"credit recovery\" courses, and 131 participated and passed the courses, 92 from North Caroline and 39 from Colonel Richardson.\"It was less students this year, which you could say is a good thing because if you are doing credit recovery, you want less students,\" McCormick said. Students can take credit recovery courses during the school year, as well as repeat courses to earn credits needed for graduation.The program for students with disabilities from elementary through high school increased by 30, with 127 students participating, 102 at the elementary level, and 25 secondary students.CCPS Food Service provided breakfast and lunch for all students, as well as lunch for elementary students, or nearly 15,000 meals. Health rooms were staffed with nurses and health assistants, and School Based Wellness Centers were open.McCormick expects next year's program to be the same duration.\"Nineteen days is amazing.It's not too short, and it's not too long,\" she said.Because some classrooms had waitlists, McCormick said her \"goal is to increase summer programming by 400 students, so I have to have about 1,200 to 1,300 students next summer.\"A 21st Century Grant is pending to help fund the program.This year's program was funded by the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) Fund, food services and in-kind in use of buildings, according to CCPS Communications Officer Sandi Barry.\"We have this funding for one more year, and we want to make sure we maximize it.,\" Simmons said. \"We will continue to look for grant opportunities working with our partners, with Recreation Parks, with the YMCA, if possible.\"\"We will continue working with our partners, but we're going to maximize everything we can to make it make it work, make it sustainable, and then have the great data to then go to the grant sources to keep the funding coming in,\" Simmons said. \n \n Caption: A big bounce house and slippery slide cool off Preston Elementary School students who attend the 19-day summer program.\n \nA little game of checkers is a great way to connect during summer camp at Greensboro Elementary School.\n \nLindsey McCormick, CCPS director of College and Career Readiness, presents results of the Summer School program.\n \nThese two friendly Greensboro Elementary School Hornets are not in a stinging mood during summer camp. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Raskin leads recognition of Banned Books Week\n\n September 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josie Jack; Capital News Service | Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 466\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Mary-land, and Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, introduced a bill Wednesday calling for the national recognition of Banned Books Week, which is Oct. 1-7, and the condemnation of banning books in school libraries.The bill recommends that local governments and schools \"protect the rights of students to learn and the ability of educators and librarians to teach\" and calls for upholding the First Amendment but does not include a unified national protocol for dealing with book bans.\"You know, the proper response to hating a book in a free society is you don't read the book,\" Raskin said at a Capitol Hill press conference Wednesday.The bill, which has 40 co-sponsors in the House and 15 in the Senate, echoes bills the lawmakers introduced in the last session of Congress but neither measure passed.Instances of book banning increased by 33% from the 2021-2022 school year to the 2022-2023 school year, according to the nonprofit PEN America. Books such as \"The Bluest Eye\" by Toni Morrison and \"Gender Queer: A Memoir\" by Maia Kobabe repeatedly have been targeted by critics. Many titles that receive so-called requests for review involve themes of race, sexuality and sexual abuse.Between July 1, 2022, and June 30, there were 3,362 instances of book banning in public libraries and in schools, according to PEN America.Florida accounted for 40% of the book bans. Top states where book bans were instituted were Texas, Utah, Missouri and Pennsylvania.The Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month held a hearing on book bans, where senators and five witnesses discussed balancing the freedom of speech of parents and taxpayers with those of students, teachers and librarians. The hearing examined book ban policies at the state and local level.The debate did not include the introduction of federal policies on book bans nor a tangible, federal solution. Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, asked witnesses Cameron Samuels, a student at Brandeis University and co-founder of Students Engaged in Advancing Texas, and Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias to provide a clear solution; neither did.\"The discussion we've been having for me, it's a little too conceptual, or I don't know, metaphysical,\" Kennedy said.The federal government has not passed legislation to create a unified procedure on book bans. Book ban and review policies and decisions are currently made at the local government level.On June 12, Illinois passed a law that makes libraries that ban books ineligible for state-funded grants. It is the first state in the country to take such action and could pave the way for future federal legislation.\"It's my hope that other states, that others may look toward Illinois and see the value in adopting our legislation as a model to stop banning books in its tracks and to protect the right to read freely without fear of retribution,\" Giannou-lias said at the legislation's signing. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It would be helpful for the Star to provide bylines for OpEds with political themes. In this case, it would show that David Reel is the former chairman of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee.This OpEd is characteristic of what I call the post 2016 American Enterprise sandwich. The American Enterprise Institute is the longtime conservative redoubt that has employed the likes of Newt Gingrich and Dinesh D'Souza.In off-year elections, the party not in the White House characteristically does very, very well. In 2016, the Republican Party let their extreme Donald Trump flag fly with disappointing results including the continuing speaker of the House fiasco and legislative stalemate because of the Republican Party's slimmest of majorities.The American Enterprise sandwich is a way for the conservative fringe to further itself with the veneer of non-combative moderation. The sandwich opens with a seemingly nonpartisan theme, in this case challenges and opportunities for Democrats and Republicans in addressing the African American electorate.The meat follows with opinion and statistics which are negative for the Democratic Party. The final section contains platitudes about listening to the electorate.Any piece dealing with how the Republican Party relates to the African American electorate that does not include the nationwide voter suppression efforts targeting that community cannot be taken seriously.In the case of David Reel's OpEd, it is not only in the style of the American Enterprise sandwich, but all the opinion is from American Enterprise staff and all the data is from American Enterprise surveys.Be on the look out for this type of opinion piece and remember that Donald Trump is overwhelmingly favored to be the presidential candidate for the Republican Party in 2024. Donald Trump is an existential threat to our democracy, and any attempts to distract from that reality should be ignored.HOLLY WRIGHTEastonDo more, with moreQuality education is the foundation of any flourishing society. As diversity, equity and inclusion get forced into everyday life by small groups around America, what happened to education?Groups are trying to measure equity and inclusion but seem to be totally ignoring the measurement of our schools and student performance.One recent report cited 13 public schools in Baltimore with less than 5% of students passing math and reading at grade level. How are voters not horrified and ashamed?Our governor is at public events for the arts and everything else under the sun but what has been offered to measure concrete improvements to our school, teacher and student performance? Has anyone in government or the Department of Education set a performance milestone to address this total failure. How can anyone so blatantly ignore these failing grades.There are the parades and protests supporting just about any cause or whim but not for education.Just a thought: How about our governor and the Board of Education and teachers union commit that 50% of Baltimore students will pass reading and math at grade level before the next election in 2026. 50% is still embarrassingly poor but it would be a start. (70% in the other state school districts.)Do any tax paying or voting citizens think 50% is too big of a job for our leaders? Would our teachers themselves accept a failure rate of 50%? Apparently so and for years. These results were here before COVID-19, and the money has been available for many years. Look at how much has been spent per student in our Baltimore public schools compared to the much more successful schools around the country.Clearly, money in Maryland is not the problem. Do more, with more. Accountability.We need measurable commitments from Gov. Moore and the dducation department followed by results before the next election cycle. We need to stop hiding from this clear failure of our youth and present the voting public with a plan to enforce measurement results.We are anxiously waiting.RICH ADRIANEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Counties ponder money for college building - Financial commitment worries many of the county officials\n\n October 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 16 | Section: News \n \n 675\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Talbot and Queen Anne's counties came together virtually recently to discuss a $79 million project to build a new Technical Center at Chesapeake College?Each county must decide whether or not it wants to submit a letter of intent to the Maryland Higher Education Commission to provide local funds for the facility before a Sept. 28 meeting at the Department of Budget and Management. The meeting, according to Chesapeake College President Cliff Coppersmith, is an opportunity to get the project \"to the next level\" by getting it put on a state list of capital projects.The state has agreed to pay for 75% of the capital project. With these letters of intent, each county would agree to providing local funds for the other 25%. In an email, Coppersmith said that once state funding has been allocated and approved, each supporting county would need to pass appropriations to fund the local share of the capital project.The facility would be more than 90,000 square feet. Of that total, 52,000 square feet would be assignable space. Currently, construction is set for 2026. The center will be located next to the Eastern Shore Higher Education Center.\"Our problem right now is we've got so much equipment crammed in these spaces, there's not a lot of room for students,\" Coppersmith said of the current Queen Anne's Technical Building during the meeting.According to meeting documents from a Queen Anne's County Commissioners meeting Sept. 12, the new facility \"will house programs such as electrical, welding, HVAC, culinary, skilled office/administrative support and marine and construction trades training.\"Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian chaired the meeting between counties Monday evening. Fithian said that while the new facility would be great to have on the Eastern Shore, Kent County does have concerns about the financial aspect of the project.Caroline County Commission Vice President Larry Porter said the cost of building the new facility is what strikes him most.\"I would really like to have a little bit more information about where that number is coming from,\" he said.Coppersmith said the estimated cost includes furnishing the building. He added that the equipment is not a part of that estimate.\"Existing equipment that's useable and still in date, we would just move into the new facility and obviously we would raise money - private funding, public grants, etc. - to upgrade our equipment once we get the building built and we're ready to move in,\" Coppersmith said.Queen Anne's County Commissioner Jack Wilson Jr. acknowledged that the price of the project is a concern, but said he feels confident they will be able to receive more money from the state for the project.Later in the meeting, Wilson said that the Queen Anne's County Commissioners had already voted last week in favor of providing letter of intent.Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said Dorchester County would have to vote against sending a letter of intent at this time. Pfeffer acknowledged that it is a \"great project\" but said that fiscal responsibilities in the county are keeping them from being able to send a letter of intent. Pfeffer said Dorchester County commissioners would be willing to send a letter of support for the project without a binding fiscal commitment.Fithian said each county is going to have to make its decision individually.\"We're all going to have to sit down with our finance office and really see what we can do,\" he said.During the meeting there were talks of possibly submitting a letter, signed by all five counties, detailing the benefits of having this new facility in order to obtain addition funding from the state.Toward the end of the meeting, Talbot County Council member Keasha Haythe said she will be voting in favor ofTalbot County submitting a letter of intent.\"As a Chesapeake College alum, I believe it's very necessary and needed,\" she said. \"And considering how the labor force is doing a dive right now, this labor force is needed. We definitely have to be forward thinking to be able to accommodate the future needs of our children and those that are in high school currently.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Counties sue social media over mental health in schools - Talbot among 10 counties claiming classroom distraction\n\n October 5, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Christina Walker; Capital News Service | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1088\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A \"boring and pointless\" education.That's what students at Henry E. Lackey High School in Indian Head, in Charles County, tell their English teacher Nicholas Gray they're receiving while they distract themselves with TikTok videos, \"snaps\" on Snapchat and endless scrolls through Instagram during class.\"It is difficult to convince [students] that learning is more impactful and important than the brand new video that will entertain them,\" Gray said.With that thought in mind, Charles County this month joined nine other Maryland school districts in a lawsuit against the world's social media giants: Google, Meta, ByteDance and Snap Inc. Other school districts in the state that have joined the court action are Anne Arundel, Baltimore City, Carroll, Cecil, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George's and Talbot.\"Hopefully this lawsuit provides pressure for some action in terms of how to better create products that are geared to children,\" said Maria Navarro, superintendent of Charles County Public Schools.CLASSROOM DISTRACTIONThe lawsuit accused several social media platforms of targeting and manipulating youth so they stay engaged for excessive amounts of time - and that's exactly what educators see in Charles County classrooms.\"(Social media is) a huge distraction in our schools and in our classrooms,\" said Cheryl Davis, principal of Henry E. Lackey High School.The teachers do their part to plan effective, instructional uses for technology in the classroom, Davis said, but personal devices get in the way.Gray said he prohibits the use of cell phones during instructional times and tries to create engaging lessons so that students will not be tempted to use their devices or go on social media.However, he said, the biggest problem plaguing his students is self control and their failure to regulate personal behavior.\"Students are lacking the ability to express their emotions in a positive way,\" Davis said. \"We see a lot more negative expressions.\"Students have gotten more angry and aggressive, Davis said. In a developmental part of their lives, they often fail to pause for a moment and look for resources or constructive ways to express their emotions.\"There is no respite,\" Gray said. \"Students leave for the day and the talking/anger continues onto Instagram or Snapchat, and then the students come to school upset over what is on social media.\"Several Charles County educators said more physical altercations have occurred because of social media conflicts.\"Snapchat scares me,\" said Brian Street, a father of two Piccowaxen middle schoolers.\"I've seen several fights at school on Snapchat.\"On top of that, two staff members at St. Charles High School were injured Thursday after they intervened in a physical altercation between students that started over a social media post, according to a letter that Principal Tammika Little sent out to parents.\"Please monitor your child's electronic devices and social media accounts,\" Little said.MENTAL HEALTHNot surprisingly, school officials in Charles County and elsewhere are alarmed at how social media affects child development and mental health. That concern is also reflected in the lawsuit, which alleges that companies are aware of the negative impacts the platforms have on children's mental health, but they choose to prioritize profit.Students go through developmental changes from elementary school to middle school, where their focus shifts from their parents to their peer group. Navarro said this is when children start pushing their own boundaries and understanding how to become an adult.As students become more self-sufficient, they begin building confidence - but social media usage during this stage can interrupt a child's growth, Navarro said.\"A fake reality, at those pivotal developmental ages, has more of an impact on behavioral health,\" Navarro said. \"It also isolates you.\"Navarro said social media augments the insecurities children face at pivotal ages, and research seems to prove that point. Researchers at Facebook found that Instagram, in 2021, made one in three girls feel worse about their bodies, according to the Wall Street Journal.Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic further isolated children and left many in a more fragile mental state.According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2021, suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 14.Charles County educators said social media contributes to the mental health crises that some young people endure. Inappropriate social media interactions continue to create disruptions in the buildings all over the county because children these ages are not developmentally ready for the responsibility, Davis said.\"Students lack the maturity to be able to handle social media,\" Davis said.That being the case, Davis said schools must make mental health a priority or else their true purpose will not be achieved.\"We are here to educate students,\" Davis said. \"If students are not in the right mindset, then it's much more difficult for them to access education.\"Searching for solutions While voicing support for the lawsuit, Charles County educators are looking elsewhere for more prompt solutions to the problems social media causes in the classroom.Davis pushed for parents to be a part of the solution.\"You pay for the phone, you own the phone, put some apps on there that allow you to control access,\" Davis said.Parents should be monitoring their kids' devices to make sure they're safe, Davis said, and it is not just her who feels this way.\"It's not a school thing, it's a parent thing,\" Street said.He said that while he does monitor his kids' social media usage, it is a parents' decision on how active they want to be in controlling it.Navarro said Charles County Public Schools has many resources for parents to learn how to be tech savvy so they know how to keep their children safe. In addition to limiting screen time, she said parents should be encouraging their kids to physically play, talk and participate in sports and extracurricular activities with other kids.Navarro said when to allow children to have devices is a parent's choice.\"My job is to inform and educate them about the implications of those decisions,\" Navarro said. She said she wants students to reach their full potential, but right now social media makes it harder for them to do that.That's where the lawsuit could help.Navarro said that if the district gets any compensation from this lawsuit, the school system intends to expand resources for the growing needs of behavioral health.And even in these early stages, Navarro said, the lawsuit serves an important purpose.\"It sends a message,\" she said.The message: that everyone - from social media companies to educators to parents to students - must be alert to the harm that social media can do to young people. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Level one is a \"beginning learner,\" level two is a \"developing learner,\" and level four is a \"distinguished learner.\"Students who fall into levels 3 and 4 are considered proficient in the subject. In Dorchester County, the percent of students that fall into level 4 for the English language arts and math categories are between 0 and 5%.For the level three proficient learner category in English language arts, compared to Spring 2022 data:▪ Third graders increased to 31% from 26.4%.▪ Fourth graders increased to 32% from 27.6%.▪ Fifth graders increased to 33% from 26.8%▪ Sixth graders increased to 33% from 22.2% - a 10.8% increase.▪ Seventh graders decreased to 20% from 24.1%.▪ Eighth graders decreased to 27% from 29.2%.Along with seventh and eighth graders, there was a drop in the percent of proficient learners for the English 10 assessment compared to the previous year. The percentage dropped from 36.4% to 35%.Colman said the state average growth for English language arts was 2.9 percentage points.Dorchester County's average growth was 4.1 percentage points, she said.\"So we grew significantly, or doubled, the amount that the rest of the state did,\" she said. \"It put us at the eleventh spot [in the state] as far as growth is concerned.\"Laura Aberg, DCPS supervisor of reading and English language arts for K through 12, spoke after Colman presented on the English language arts data.\"I'm excited to see all the growth for our younger students,\" she said.\"Our secondary students, we need to do some work to get back to the levels of growth that we like to see.\"Aberg said the district has implemented more diagnostics at the beginning of the year to identify those \"reading gaps\" so they can be addressed sooner for secondary students. She also talked about getting ready to enroll students in grades six through eight, as well as tenth graders, in MCAP tutorials.Aberg said she hopes to see even greater growth for younger students in the future since the district has implemented a foundational reading program that aligns with the science of reading, or the research behind how students learn to read.Board Member Theresa Stafford asked Aberg what the district did differently last year that might be attributed to the growth in proficiency for elementary students.Aberg mentioned multiple changes including the use of DIBELS test data to \"help drive instruction\" and getting teachers trained in the science of reading.MATHWhen it came to MCAP math assessments, grade seven and Algebra I saw significant increases in proficiency. The percentage of seventh graders that were considered proficient learners increased to 11% from less than 5% the year before. The percentage of Algebra I students that were considered proficient learners increased to 10% from less than 5% the year before.For grade six, there was a decrease in proficient learners, compared the year before, from 10% to less than 5%.For the other math assessments in the county, there was a mix of slight increases, slight decreases and constants in the percentage of proficient learners compared to the previous year. These include:▪ Third graders decreased to 20% from 20.3%▪ Fourth graders increased to 15% from 14.6%▪ Fifth graders increased to 14% from 12.2%▪ Eighth graders stayed at less than 5%▪ Geometry students stayed at 0%▪ Algebra II students decreased to 0% from less than 5%Colman said that while the state average growth for math was 2.5 percentage points, Dorchester County grew 2.0 percentage points.DCPS is focusing on improving math scores for third graders, sixth graders and Algebra I students this year, she said.\"Those were kind of the focus areas as far as the data,\" Colman said.She said there is a focus on third grade because it is the first group of students to take the MCAP assessments and there is a need for those students to gain a better understanding of the assessment.At the middle school level, Colman said the math coach is working with teachers and modeling lessons. The math coach is also working and planning with Algebra I teachers.\"So she's kind of targeted certain grade levels to try to impact some of this data,\" Colman said.After Colman's presentation on the math data, Board Member Chris Wheedleton talked about the importance of recognizing the data, good and bad, and talking about how the data can be improved for next year.\"I'm really pleased to see what you all are doing with this, how you've organized it,\" he said. \"But then, it's really about the action.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

All of a sudden, this professional caregiver was on the other side of needing care.Hart, a resident of Worton, had developed sepsis after a surgery in 2020, and needed around the clock care in her recovery. \"If it wasn't for my two aunts,\" Hart stated, \"I wouldn't be here right now.\" Hart's aunts went to work, re-arranging the home to make it more accommodating for Hart's care. \"They bathed me, brushed my teeth and hair,\" said Hart. \"I owe them the world.\" This traumatizing experience gave Hart a better insight into what her clients go through, how vulnerable they are.Hart, a Worton resident, works for Griswold Home Care, a business founded over 40 years ago by Dr. Jean Griswold in suburban Philadelphia. Some of Hart's clients are simply looking for companionship while others require more involved personal care services.Hart was recently awarded $3,000 in scholarship funds after winning the company's 2023 National Caregiver Scholarship Program, in partnership with its nonprofit organization, the Jean Griswold Foundation. She plans on using it as she pursues a RN nursing degree.The Griswold National Caregiver Scholarship Program is intended to offer financial support to family caregivers, professional caregivers, and those interested in pursuing a career in the care industry. Hart was nominated for the scholarship for being an exceptional caregiver in the Worton area of Kent County. Hart feels lucky to be a part of the Griswold Home Care family.\"Their support has pushed me toward success. I wouldn't trade what I was doing for anything in this world.\" Hart began caregiving at an early age, taking care of her niece who had special needs. Though she tried working in retail, her heart just wasn't in it. When she began delivering professional care to clients, she knew this would become her life's work.\"My purpose was fulfilled,\" said Hart.Part of the joy she finds from her work is getting to know the stories of her grateful clients.\"The veterans share details of coming home from war,\" she said. Another memorable client was a woman who was paralyzed when a drunk driver hit her on the night of her senior prom.\"She had every right to be angry, but she was just happy that she was saved,\" Hart said. \"I believe that there is always something to learn from everyone I serve.\" \"Our founder Jean Griswold believed in lifelong education and the importance of providing growth opportunities for our care professionals. Post-pandemic, the crucial role played by caregivers became obvious, and the Jean Griswold Foundation Board of Directors felt strongly about refocusing its mission to support them financially through scholarships,\" said Michael Slupecki, CEO of Griswold, and Jean Griswold Foundation Board member.\"Money is often the only thing standing between a motivated caregiver and a degree or certification.If we can help elevate the care profession through education, it benefits not only Griswold, but everyone across the country. Because if you haven't yet needed the support of a caregiver, you absolutely will someday.\" \n \n Caption: CASEY HART \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Open to students across the Shore, including Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot, working individually or in groups, Junior Division (grades six-eight) and Senior Division (grades nine-12) students select a topic related to an annual theme. Information on the competitive event is distributed to students by their history teachers.The 2024 NHD theme is \"Turning Points in History.\" There are five different types of projects that students complete: documentaries, exhibits, performances, and websites that can be done as a group or individually or papers that may only be done individually.Research is key, so the two teachers partnered with the public libraries in the participating Upper Shore counties of Queen Anne's, Kent, Talbot, and Cecil.\"Schools have limited research options,\" said Hayman, \"so we turned to the county libraries who have more resources.\" During the fall season, as students begin picking a theme and looking for information, the teachers make themselves available at libraries across the region on specific dates so that librarians and History Day staff can provide assistance with finding research options, accessing online databases, or browsing materials.Hayman said the students learn valuable skills \"like how to analyze information, to make sure sources are reliable, and to form their own opinion.\" Last weekend, Hayman and Anders visited Queen Anne's Library on Kent Island. Next up is the Talbot County Free Library in Easton on Oct. 21 from 9 a.m. 1 p.m.; Queen Anne's County Library in Centreville from 9 a.m. 1 p.m. on Nov. 4; and the Learning Resource Center at Chesapeake College on Nov. 12 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.The actual contest is March 23, 2024, at Chesapeake College. Judges from the Upper-Shore community include teachers, professors, and museum staff. Students who place are then able to participate in the state finals on May 4 at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.The hard work of Hayman and Anders has paid off. \"We saw that at the beginning the winners were always from the western shore,\" said Anders.\"Now we send more students to the state event than everyone but Baltimore County.\" Hayman said the program helps make history more real and interesting to students.\"You don't usually have students thrilled to be in history class,\" said Hayman. \"Students who participate sometimes find their true passion.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nThomas Hayman and Andy Anders, both history teachers at Centreville Middle School, visit Queen Anne's County Library Kent Island branch on their first stop helping students from the Upper Shore with their History Day project research. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lawrence Wetlands Preserve officially opens in Chestertown\n\n October 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Laura Tayman | Page: 12 | Section: News \n \n 681\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN - It took the efforts of county, state, and federal governments to make Michael Lawrence's dream of children learning in the outdoors a reality. The Sultana Education Foundation held a ribbon cutting ceremony for its new Lawrence Wetlands Preserve this week.Drew McMullen, President of the Sultana Education Foundation located in Chestertown, said the educational programs provided by the foundation show how the Chesapeake Bay includes wetlands, shoreline, and now the watershed. \"We can now show the connection between land and water,\" he said.Under development since 2017, the Lawrence Wetlands Preserve is an 8.5-acre urban nature center that features a variety of ecosystems including upland forest, swamp, marsh, shrublands, meadows, and a freshwater pond. In addition to its natural elements, the property boasts an accessible trail network, wetland boardwalk, viewing platforms, an activity field, and the 1,200-square-foot Harwood Nature Center.The land was purchased from Washington College in 2017.McMullen told the ribbon-cutting guests that already the foundation has provided over 200,000 students from the Eastern Shore and 15 other counties hands-on lessons, \"now that the center is open new programs start next week.\" Joining the ribbon cutting team were state Senator Stephen Hershey, state Delegate Jay Jacobs, National Park Service Planning and Development Manager Bob Campbell, Chestertown Councilman Albert Nickerson, and Kent County Superintendent of Schools Dr. Karen Couch.Jacobs, a Kent County resident, took a tour of the area before the project began. \"I've seen the before and after, and it's remarkable\" he said. As for funding they received from the state, Jacobs said, \"It speaks to the credibility of the Sultana foundation that they were able to get that kind of funding level - when you get what you want when you want it.\" \"We are grateful to Mr.Lawrence and the individuals, foundations, and government agencies that made the creation of the Preserve possible,\" commented Sultana Board Chair Robert Hindman. \"We're thrilled to have created a resource that will enhance the Foundation's environmental education programs while serving as a green space for the entire community.\" Several state and federal agencies awarded sizable grants to the project including the Maryland General Assembly, the National Park Service, Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, the Maryland Heritage Areas Authority, the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, and the Stories of the Chesapeake Heritage Area.The Lawrence Wetlands Preserve will host environmental literacy programs and professional development opportunities for 3,000 students and teachers annually, with a focus on PreK through fifth grade. The Preserve will often be used in conjunction with activities taking place at other locations on Sultana's Chestertown campus, including its LEED Platinum Holt Education Center, the schooner SULTANA, and canoe and kayak trips based out of Wilmer Park.When not in use for programs, the Preserve will serve as a contact point for the National Park Service's Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, host programs for the public, and be open for general visitation daily from dusk to dawn.Kent County Superintendent Dr. Karen Couch said McCullen was one of the first people she met when she came to the county. \"I found we weren't accessing the foundation like we should. Together we worked diligently to provide students valuable lessons to become good environmental stewards,\" said Couch.All KCPS students from pre-k through grade eight have had at least one activity with the foundation. Using the Maryland state science standards, plans are for all first grades to visit and study bird adaptations; for all third graders to student pond ecology, and all eighth graders to study soil and water chemistry.\"This is hands-on learning by doing,\" said Couch. These lessons will stay with them the rest of their lives.\" Said Hershey, \"It's important that students learn how things work outside of the classroom. A lot of us would have loved to get these opportunities when we were young.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nState Delegate Jay Jacobs, State Senator Stephen Hershey, Kent County Schools Superintendent Dr. Karen Couch, Kent County Commissioner Albert Nickerson, National Park Service Planning and Development Manager Bob Campbell, and Drew McMullen, president of the Sultana Education Foundation cut the ribbon to open the Lawrence Wetlands Preserve in Chestertown. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Washington College receives $54.7 Million from Hodson Trust - Guarantees $30k+ scholarships for students with a 3.3+ GPA\n\n October 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 10 | Section: News \n \n 492\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN - Washington College announced the largest gift in the College's 240-year history: a $54.7 million gift from The Hodson Trust to provide financial support for students. The Hodson gift will grow the College's scholarship endowment to approximately $170 million and its overall endowment to $325 million, strengthening the College's ability to make a college education more affordable to students from all backgrounds.\"This generous gift from The Hodson Trust is truly transformative for Washington College,\" said President Mike Sosulski. \"Access to an outstanding educational experience is a pressing issue for many families today. The Trust's support of our students' financial needs expands our ability to ensure access to a wide range of potential students, particularly those who are first-generation or come from underserved communities.\" As a result of the Hodson gift, Washington College will guarantee a minimum scholarship of $30,000 per year ($120,000 over four years) to any incoming student with at least a 3.3 grade point average who applies by Dec. 1. Students may qualify for more aid based on their academic performance. The Hodson Trust Washington Scholars endowment, which provides full tuition, fees and the cost of room and board for students with significant financial need, will also benefit from this gift.\"We are excited to be able to offer this scholarship opportunity to deserving students,\" said Vice President for Enrollment Johnnie Johnson. \"It will allow us to continue to grow the diversity of our campus community and enhance the intellectual environment of the College. These scholarship funds will help us recruit more of the best and brightest students to Washington College from Maryland, the mid-Atlantic region, and beyond.\" Support for financial aid opens new opportunities for students and their families who think an education at a private college is out of reach.Because private colleges like Washington provide significant student financial aid when compared to public universities, the cost of a private education becomes more affordable. For the current academic year, Washington College provided $40.6 million in total financial aid with the average student aid totaling $45,745, compared to the University of Maryland, whose published average student aid is $9,074.The gift is part of the dissolution of The Hodson Trust. Established in 1920 by Colonel Clarence Hodson, the Trust has been a longtime supporter of Washington College and its largest benefactor, having now donated more than $150 million to the College since 1935.For almost 90 years, The Hodson Trust has contributed to Washington College in a number of ways, including establishing or contributing to endowments that support student scholarships; undergraduate research and internship stipends; faculty chairs, salary enhancement, and professional development funds; and the College's signature academic centers. In addition, The Hodson Trust contributed to the construction of Hodson Hall, Hodson Boathouse, the John Toll Science Center, and the Lelia Hynson Boating Park.The Hodson family has a long and illustrious legacy at Washington College.Colonel Hodson, his daughter, Lelia Hodson Hynson, and granddaughter, Sally Hynson Hopkins, served on the Washington College Board of Visitors and Governors. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chapel District Elementary renovation design plans move to state for review\n\n October 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 568\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - The Talbot County Board of Education approved the design development submission for the Chapel District Elementary School renovation and addition at a Board of Education meeting Wednesday evening.The design development plan needs to be submitted to the state for review by Nov. 1. TCPS Director of Operations Kevin Shafer said this submission is the next milestone in the design process.Before the board voted unanimously to submit the design development plan, Shafer and Adam McDonald, project manager and architect from design firm Hord Coplan Macht, gave a presentation to update the board on plans for the project, including the schedule and estimated project costs.McDonald explained that the project includes a full renovation of the existing building and 16,600 square feet of additions.Three total additions at different corners of the building will add additional learning space.\"The additions are also going to help us enhance the overall design of the building,\" McDonald said.Since the board's last update on project plans, McDonald said they have made changes to the addition on the north corner of the building to \"work better with the existing utilities\" during construction.A traffic pattern has been formalized, and a first submission has been made to the State Highway Administration to create an additional curb cut to separate the parent entry loop from the bus drop.\"To help alleviate some of the traffic concerns that come with a shared entrance,\" McDonald said.The design plans for outside also include an extension to the parking lot to provide more space for parents dropping off students.Inside the building, McDonald said that most spaces will remain in the same areas as they are pre-renovation.The main change, he said, is that the media center will move to the front of the building and the art classroom will take over where the current media center is.Currently, bidding for the project is expected to take place in April and May of 2024. Construction would begin in June of 2024 and is estimated to take about two years.The estimated cost of construction and site work is $25.18 million. State and county funding for this will come out of FY2025 and FY2026 budgets. With additional expenditures, for things like design costs, the project is expected to cost $29.97 million.Shafer said this estimated cost is $1 million less than the state projection for the project.\"So I feel like we're within where we want to be,\" he said, adding that this is still just a projection and the real numbers will come when they bid the project out.After the presentation, board members asked questions.Board Member Deborah Bridges asked about the plan for the school's roof.\"The slanted roofs really have me worried,\" she said, expressing concern about drainage.Shafer said the pitched roof is not near the courtyard.\"The architect will make sure that any kind of drainage that's coming off the roof, whether it's roof drain or exterior drain, is properly sized to accommodate that water shed,\" he said. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nAdam McDonald, project manager and architect from design firm Hord Coplan Macht, updates the Talbot County Board of Education on design plans for the Chapel District Elementary School renovation and addition project at a Board of Education meeting Oct. 18.\n \nCOURTESY OF TALBOT COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS\n \nA rendering of what the front of Chapel District Elementary School would look like based on renovation and addition project plans. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There are still spots open for William Messner's lecture on the \"Rise and Fall of the Talbot Boys Memorial\" and for \"Integrity and Effective Leadership\" at the USNA.Join Messner on Tuesday, Nov. 14, from 1 to 2:20 p.m. as he lays out the factors that prompted the Talbot Boy's statue's removal last year.As he explains, the pre-WW I period marked the zenith of racism in the nation. Especially in the South, this period saw the institutionalization of segregation and the utilization of extra-legal means, such as lynching, to insure the maintenance of the racial order.Not coincidentally, throughout the South, memorials to the Confederate lost cause appeared, often in the form of statues of Rebel soldiers. Talbot County was not immune to this pattern of activity, as a memorial to those county residents who fought for the Confederacy - the Talbot Boys - was constructed on the Courthouse lawn in Easton.A century later the statue, one of the last in the South still standing on public grounds, was dismantled, the result of a decade of agitation on the part of Black residents and their allies who demanded the erasure of all vestiges of the old racial order.The event will be hybrid, in person at Easton Family YMCA or via ZOOM.It is $20 to reserve a spot. To register, visit https://chesapeakeforum.org.On Wednesday, Nov. 15, travel to the US Naval Academy for a lecture on how ethics and moral reasoning guide behavior, while integrity defines how individuals conduct their daily lives.Taking from both classical and contemporary thought in moral philosophy, Jeff Macris, Ph.D., the deputy director of the Stockdale Institute, will show how the USNA seeks to provide its future Naval officers with the ability to understand the moral complexities of leadership.\"Integrity and Effective Leadership\" is a field trip to the USNA by carpool or private vehicle from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. It costs $20 to participate.To register, visit https://chesapeakeforum.org. \n \n Caption: JEFF MACRIS\n \nBILL MESSNER \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She started working in 2021 at McDonald's in Denton, \"where she strived to build relationships with people from different backgrounds and experiences,\" according to an Oct. 11 press release.She is studying veterinary medicine with the goal of becoming a veterinarian.Recipients were selected based on their demonstrated leadership, participation in local community activities, work experience, experience in overcoming challenges, and who and what has inspired them.\"Often, we are the first job for many of our high school employees, said Michael A. Meoli, owner and operator of The Meoli Family McDonald's Restaurants.\"Nothing pleases us more than to see them go on to future success and to support that journey.\" With its scholarship program, Meoli Companies supports \"hardworking employees who are headed to college,\" according to the press release.Headquartered in Rehoboth Beach, Meoli Companies owns and operates 25 McDonald's restaurants across the Delmarva Peninsula.The other scholarship recipients included Jonathan Brittingham of Selbyville, Delaware, who is attending the University of Delaware in Newark, Delaware; Henry Grote of Selbyville, Delaware, who attending Liberty University in Lynchburg Virginia; Monique Payne of Dover, Delaware, who is attending Delaware State University in Dover; and McKenzie Tubbs of Millsboro, Delaware, who is attending the University of Delaware.The scholarship application asked students questions which focused on the employee's overall story, their presence in the community, challenges they have overcome and plans for their education.\"While we respect the importance of a student's GPA as a demonstration of their commitment to learning, we consider many more attributes to ensure we have a well-rounded picture of the individuals we consider for a scholarship,\" Meoli said.\"The response was overwhelming and speaks to the incredible stories these graduates have to share,\" he said. \"For nearly 30 years, we've been committed to delivering a gold standard experience for our McDonald's customers each and every time they visit our restaurants, and that starts by hiring outstanding people.\" \"It's not just about the food we serve or the restaurants we serve it in. It's about the communities in which our restaurants operate. Each of our communities is unique and we strive to find ways we can make the greatest impact in every one of them,\" Meoli said. \n \n Caption: FAITH JOHNSON \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Chemistry Department at Washington College is committed to uniting the community through captivating autumn experiments and thrilling displays of chemical phenomena.\" Washington College's Chemistry department regularly conducts events and activities to engage the local community in the wonders of using science in an effort to encourage more interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) related degrees and careers.In November, the department will host AP students from Queen Anne's High School to tour and conduct experiments in their stateof-the-art lab.For more information on Washington College's chemistry department and degree options visit https://www.washcoll. edu/academic departments/chemistry/index.php. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF WASHINGTON COLLEGE\n \nStudents put together several experiments to test the best way to either explode designs into pumpkins to create unique jack-o-lanterns or generate emissions of various ooze and smoke to come out of unique designs.

    "content": "Black and Hispanic faculty underrepresented in universities\n\n November 2, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Nira Dayanim; Capital News Service | Page: 11 | Section: News \n \n 816\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Black and Hispanic communities are underrepresented among university faculty at Maryland's six largest public universities, according to the 2021 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).This analysis does not include Maryland's online universities or historically black colleges and universities.IPEDS is an annual data collection system run through the U.S. Department of Education.These findings align with trends across the country, data shows.The U.S. Census projects that 32% of Maryland's population are Black and 12% are Hispanic.At Maryland's six largest in-person public universities, not including HBCUs - University of Maryland, Baltimore County; University of Maryland, College Park; Towson University; Frostburg State University; Salisbury University and St. Mary's College of Maryland-less than 6% of the total faculty are Black and less than 5% are Hispanic, as of 2021.According to Laura Perna, Vice Provost for Faculty at University of Pennsylvania and a researcher on college access, faculty underrepresentation is a widespread issue, though the specifics differ by university.Across Maryland, faculty demographics vary widely. At Towson University, 7% of faculty were Black in fall 2021 and 3% were Hispanic. At Frostburg State University, those numbers were about halved, with 4% Black faculty and almost 1% Hispanic faculty.Prior to 2022, Maryland's education code allowed individual public universities to implement their own plans for \"cultural diversity,\" which ranged in length and breadth. In 2022, a new code was instituted, requiring public universities to ensure that faculty, staff, and administration demographics reflect the state's diverse population.Between 2016 and 2021, the percentages of Black and Hispanic faculty at the universities included in the analysis both increased by just under a percentage point.\"It really is amazing how little progress there has been in some ways on this,\" said Perna.According to Dr. Kimberly Griffin, Dean of University of Maryland's College of Education, many people assume that faculty will diversify alongside the student body. This \"trickle up\" system is unrealistic, she says.The problem is multifaceted, says Griffin. Academia is tasked with generating a pool, hiring inclusively, yielding candidates, onboarding hirees, retaining them, and ultimately, promoting them. \"We have to do more in all of those spaces,\" says Griffin, whose research has focused on issues of diversity, equity and inclusion in post-secondary education.According to Perna, one roadblock is \"invisible labor\" faculty of color often take on work that requires time and energy, but does not fit academia's standard promotion metrics.\"We should be looking at to what extent our definition of merit is very narrow,\" said Perna.Underrepresented minorities often spend more time serving on committees and mentoring students of color, labor that often goes unrecognized, says Perna. Come time for promotions, publications and course evaluations are weighted more heavily.As the student body has diversified, the gap between representation among students and faculty has widened, straining faculty of color.As of fall 2021, Black students made up 17% and Hispanic students made up 8% of the student body at the universities included in the CNS analysis. That was an increase of 10% and 19% since 2016, respectively.Faculty demographics remained stable.In 2021, the resulting ratio of Black students to Black faculty members was 60:1. The ratio of white students to white faculty members was 15:1.According to Griffin, while it's crucial for students of color to have role models and mentors of color, there isn't enough faculty of color to shoulder that responsibility alone.\"That's a load everyone should share,\" she said.A lack of diversity also impacts faculty of color pursuing tenure. At Maryland's six largest in-person public universities, not including HBCUs, in 2021, 71% of tenured professors were white, 5% Black, and 4% were Hispanic, according to IPEDS.A lack of diversity among tenured faculty can make it harder for some faculty of color to find mentors as they pursue tenure, though many members of academia, like Griffin, are trying to combat this by developing intentional mentoring policy.\"Mentorship that helps you build a sense of connection and community in your unit and in your college is also really important for helping folks get to tenure,\" said Griffin.Katharina Maisel, a bioengineering professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, co-authored a list of best practices for increasing diversity alongside several other faculty members in the STEM field.According to Maisel, diversifying the faculty, especially tenure and tenure track, takes intention at every stage of the process, from inviting people to apply, inviting people for internships, and checking your shortlist to make sure you're not just inviting people from Ivy League schools.But it's possible.In science, technology, engineering and math, says Maisel, a tendency to be overspecific in job listings can discourage faculty from underrepresented backgrounds.Using rubrics to evaluate a candidate for hiring or promotion can help ensure an objective set of criteria, helping reel in internal biases, Maisel said.\"If you as a department are really actively interested in increasing the diversity of your faculty, there are things you can do,\" Maisel said. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The date is significant because fighting between the Allied countries and Germany ended on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, marking the end of World War I.\"Stop and think about this day, Veterans Day, celebrating all the service and all the sacrifice of the U.S. Military Veterans,\" Feehley said to the students. \"Veterans sacrificed so that you and I have the freedoms we enjoy today.\" Each of the seven fifth-grade classes at the school provided one question for the veterans to answer.Brian S. asked \"what advice would you give an individual who was considering entering the military?\" Jasiah P. asked \"what is the most positive thing that happened to you because you served in the armed forces?\" \"The military gave us the chance to do something we had never done or would never do, like go to the Philippines, or for me, to learn about C-4 and other demolitions, fly in planes and helicopters, or be on a ship.\" said Mike Detmer, a former Marine and member the Dorchester County Council.\"It also gives you a chance to grow close to people. When you go through training and hardship or danger with other people, just like when you're on a football or soccer team, you feel a closeness with them. I have brothers who I love a lot, but I feel extremely close to my Marine brothers.\" \"When you have served in the military, you know that you've accomplished something,\" Detmer said, \"and you are serving something much bigger than yourself.You can see how proud all of these gentlemen are about what they've done. But it's not as much pride in what they personally have done, as it is pride in what they have been a part of. That is why I would encourage you to think about it.\" At the end of the assembly, the students presented cards to the veterans, which will be delivered to patients in a Maryland VA hospital during the holidays.\"Students in fifth grade across Talbot County write letters to veterans as part of their fifth grade service learning project,\" said Jeff Bell, Easton Elementary fifth grade teacher. \"It is only appropriate that we get those letters to veterans at this time of the year.\" \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF TALBOT COUNTY SCHOOLS\n \nStudents in fifth grade across Talbot County write letters to veterans as part of their fifth grade service learning project.

Board President Emily Jackson introduced the motion at Board of Education meeting Wednesday.\"I would like to create a committee focused on special education,\" she said. \"As we all know, looking at Blueprint, the way that we are doing our budget and our funding is going to change.\"The Blueprint for Maryland's Future is a statewide plan to increase public education funding, improve student outcomes and improve the quality of public education. Jackson said this change in the way the budget is done means that there would not be a lot of specific line items \"directly applicable to special education\" in the budget.\"Combine that with the fact that our special education population has been growing rapidly,\" Jackson said to explain why she sees a need for this committee.Jackson said she would like the committee to do a holistic deep dive into what TCPS is currently doing regarding special education as well as what they could be doing. She said she would like the committee to look into modernizing the district's practices and come up with a full proposal for modernizing and funding special education in the county.\"I think that we all have talked a lot about how we need to approach special ed,\" she said.Jackson said she would like this committee to spend the year gathering information and come back next year, before budget season, with a proposal that includes what it would cost to modernize special education programming and how the district could fund it. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTalbot County Board of Education President Emily Jackson speaks about the need for a Special Education Committee at a Board of Education meeting Nov. 15. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We want every kid to experience these things that will help them to make prudent economic career decisions.\" Orr said the group of four is currently working on bylaws. The purpose of the foundation \"shall be to enhance, inspire and support educational opportunities in the area of financial literacy for all students attending Caroline County public schools,\" he said.On Nov. 16, Rowe said, \"The four of us decided that, at least at this point, it would be more impactful to focus our efforts on a specific area like financial literacy, as opposed to everything, because we just don't have a lot of money.If we get more money, then we can expand the mission, but for right now we're going to hold pat with financial literacy.\" Rowe said the founders \"will be setting up a meeting soon get our bylaws adopted and make decisions as to who could serve with us.If anyone knows of anyone in the community that would be good for this organization, we would love to have a conversation.\" \"Times are changing, and this financial literacy piece is going to become so important and we're going to grow this fund,\" said Cole, chief financial officer of WIN Transport, Inc. in Federalsburg.\"Financial literacy obviously is very powerful,\" Simmons said.\"Caroline County is still one of the only systems in the state that requires all of our high schoolers to complete a full credit of a finance course before graduation, and I'm glad we have that, but at the same time, one only has to look at the current economic situation we're in to realize that one credit during your high school experience in one county on Maryland's Eastern Shore is not solving a fiscal issue that's in front of us everywhere.But financial literacy is a massive undertaking and needed.\" Simmons explained that CCPS was the first to sign a memorandum of understanding with Junior Achievement of the Eastern Shore regarding providing students opportunities at the organization's 25,000 square-foot regional facility under construction in Salisbury.\"It's a great center, but it's also a great program that they put together, working with businesses and communities across the Eastern Shore (and it's) great, strong curriculum coming in,\" Simmons said. The curriculum aligns with the Maryland State Department of Education's requirements.He said the foundation would be in a good position to help with costs associated with students getting to the facility.\"We are the furthest distance from the center and we have the highest degree of poverty,\" Simmons said. \"We're the (school) system that has the most need with the least amount of funds to spend to get our kids there, and we have the greatest distance to drive to get there.\" He added that the Blueprint, which requires career exploration as well as dual enrollment, also requires counties to fund compliance with the legislation.\"We're required to pay for everybody's dual enrollment who are enrolled in our high schools,\" Simmons said. \"The math in Blueprint doesn't add up. They did not take financial literacy.\" \"That's where Blueprint stands right now, and we'll do our part,\" he said. He added that the foundation could \"help support other things that we're trying to do.\" \n \n Caption: SCREENSHOT\n \nDenton businessmen Bob Willey, at the lectern, and Tolbert Rowe on Nov. 7 explain how the Caroline County Education Foundation will fund financial literacy efforts for students. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hale and the class were excited to make this idea a reality.Since then, AMP cabinets with dartboard with darts included have been one of AMP's most popular products, selling out even before they were presented.Each time AMP students manufacture a product, they follow the same template.It begins with research, mood-boarding and a product pitch. With dartboards, students research the history, rules and professional leagues in the game of darts. Then each student must come up with a design for the project, followed by drafting their design and placing it on a Mood Board.This Mood Board becomes a visual they can refer to as they present their product pitch.Business partners, school officials, parents and former students are then invited to watch the students' product pitches Oct. 26.One by one, students manage the difficult task of individually pitching the details and merits of their designs to the class and guests in attendance.At the end of the presentations, everyone votes and a design is chosen.The next step in the process is called \"napkin sketching,\" which is a sketch of the product views and dimensions.These sketches are then taken to the computer aided drafting lab, where more accurate prints are made. From those prints, numeric commands are created that will drive a computer numeric control machine, which is a robot programmed to cut pieces out of stock material.Once complete, an audience is once again assembled for student presentations of the finished products, which are also offered for sale. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF CCPS\n \nAdvanced Manufacturing Program students at Caroline Career and Technology Center presented design ideas for their current project, a dartboard cabinet, on Oct. 26.

Com | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 718\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN - This past September, Ashley Singer was holding a tutoring session with a student when they both began to sense a mechanical burning smell.After exiting the building and calling 911, they waited as local responders arrived.Crews quickly gained control of the smoke situation, but the damage had been done.Singer, Executive Director of Open Doors Partners in Education, said it was a saddening setback. \"Though we had insurance, there was an estimated $40,000 loss of materials due to exposure to toxic smoke.\"Enter Associate Director Julie Blyman who had served as a crisis manager at a school.\"It was really catastrophic,\" said Blyman, \"but then we got so much support from the community.\"Singer and Blyman met when they were at the Radcliffe Creek School. The school provided them literacy training and both found early on that tutoring was what they were meant to do. Their Open Doors Partners in Education is a literacy focused organization, founded in 2020 as a direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting learning loss in local schools.As graduates of Kent County Public Schools and residents of the county, they were alarmed to watch students who were already struggling fall even further behind.\"We felt the need to do something to help and the decision was made to create a literacy focused nonprofit organization\" said Singer. \"We initially wanted to help students in first and second grade, a time when intervention can be most efficient and successful,\" said Singer, \"but as word spread through the county, students of all ages, pre-k through 9th grade, were found on our roster.\"To date, the organization has assisted over 100 students in the Orton-Gillingham literacy method, a direct, multi-sensory, structured, sequential, diagnostic and prescriptive way to teach literacy when reading, writing, and spelling that does not come easily to individuals, such as those with dyslexia.When the fire happened, the two were amazed by the support of local community organizations, including Washington College, the YMCA, and Stam's downtown.It took only one day for them to take an offer from Emmanuel Episcopal Church to use their Sunday school classrooms.Knowing that they needed a more permanent location, the group worked with Sam Shoge of Rivers & Roads Construction to find an appropriate location. They toured office space in the Lynchburg building and worked with KRM Development Corp. to get the space ready as soon as possible.Open Doors depends on grant funding to exist and has worked with Kit Cares, Inc., a charity navigator and a fiscal sponsor for their 501©3 organization. The funding provides the organization the ability to offer free services to Kent County students.\"By partnering with local schools, we can provide intensive 1:1 structured literacy instruction at no cost to the families,\" said Singer.\"We hope to reach those students who might otherwise fall through the cracks.\"The organization is also working with a nonprofit consultant on a strategic five-year plan. \"We would love to be working more with Kent Co. and Queen Anne's County Public Schools,\" said Singer. They would also like to enhance their bilingual program. \"Research says the Orton-Gillingham literacy method is the best literacy training program for bi-lingual students,\" she said.Since the fire, the organization is in need of replenishing their paperback book library for students ages 5-16. The organization also has a wish list on Amazon.com.Why are Singer and Blyman so committed to their mission? Singer said, \"It is the lightbulb moment when students discover why they want to read, when they realize that a book is an adventure, and they realize they can have many more.\"Blyman said it is all about why students come to the office for a session. \"To know that they are coming here willingly after a hard day of school, that is really inspiring,\" said Blyman. \"And it's very rewarding when we see that parents are so relieved that their children are ok to come here and know they will get the help they need.\"The Open Doors Partners in Education will have a ribbon cutting at their new location, 116-D South Lynchburg Street in Chestertown, on Dec. 1 at 5 p.m.For more information on Open Doors, go to www. opendoorsed.org. \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nAshley Singer, executive director, and Julie Blyman, associate director of Open Doors Partners in Education have opened their new location in Chestertown after a fire displaced them from their original office. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

From military and law enforcement to county government and local businesses who are needing workers with specific skills, all were on hand to answer questions and discuss options for the future.One of the presenters was Connie Dean, the Career Technology Liaison for the Queen Anne's County Economic & Tourism Development department. Dean is assisting the two schools with finding businesses who are interested in the apprenticeship program.\"Students are first given skills that would be required to work in a certain business field,\" said Dean. Then the students work 450 hours at a partnering business to earn their official apprenticeship recognition.\"I try to tell businesses internships are a bigger commitment, when the apprenticeship program would be appropriate for future workers in their field,\" she said.Currently, there are three Kent Island students who were trained in the culinary department at Chesapeake College this semester.Aly Swann said she learned about the basics like cutting meat, how to work with knives and other kitchen tools, and how to make sauces. \"I know now 100% that this is what I want to do for a living,\" she said.James Smith said the school was really helpful in letting him work some during the school day. \"I appreciate that I got a pathway for my career. I have learned skills I will use for a long time,\" said Smith.Last Tuesday, was military and law enforcement day for the Queen Anne's apprentice week, with recruiters from all armed forces branches, answering questions about basic training, money for college, and traveling the globe.Troopers Christopher Bekefiand Doug Prince provided information on the Maryland State Police Cadet program, where students aged 17-19 are assigned to perform duties that do not require police authority (example helping with crowds at large public events). Cadets are also assigned to work under the supervision of a Trooper at a truck inspection station or on patrol.They also have an explorer program for students aged 14-18, where they are introduced to various divisions and tactics like crime scene investigations, traffic stops, and forensics.Adam Tolley, supervisor of Career and Technology Education for Queen Anne's Public Schools, was pleased to see so many students engaging with a variety of workforce representatives. \"This is a very organized way to provide students who are beginning to think about real career options,\" he said.County Commissioner Philip Dumenil was present to view the new apprentice week program first hand at Queen Anne's High School. \"I like new opportunities for exposure to these kind of programs,\" said Dumenil. \"Lots of money can still be made in the trade fields. Not every kid wants to go to college.\" Queen Anne's student Austin Hahn, just a sophomore, has already chosen a career for his future, and that, said Ricketts, makes him a perfect apprentice candidate.Hahn has chosen to pursue a career in marine mechanics and pipe welding and wishes to move to the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana or Texas where he has family. \"My grandfather taught me a lot about it,\" said Hahn. \"He said it would be the best money I could ever make. When he passed away, I knew I would definitely do it.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nNew Career Coach Betsy Ricketts stands beside the poster for Queen Anne's County High School's first apprenticeship week schedule. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "MCAP results show signs of recovery from pandemic learning loss - Science scores still show decline\n\n November 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Aya Hussein; Capital News Service | Page: 27 | Section: News \n \n 840\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n COLLEGE PARK - The results for the 2023 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program tests for grades 3 to 8 show that student proficiency in English Language Arts has surpassed the level it was at before the pandemic.Math scores have improved, but have yet to fully rebound from the pandemic, while science scores have declined, according to the Maryland State Department of Education.MCAP tests are administered annually in public schools to assist educators in understanding student progression so that they can better tailor their methods of instruction, according to MSDE.Students in grades 3 to 8 take tests in English and math, while students in grades 5 and 8 are given an additional science test.ENGLISH PROFICIENCY SURPASSES 2019According to data from MSDE, average English proficiency dropped from 44% in 2019 to 31% in 2021.Proficiency increased significantly in 2022 and by a smaller degree in 2023, with results showing an average passing rate of 47%, according to MSDE.Improvements can be seen across Maryland, as every county except Somerset had an increase in English proficiency between 2022 and 2023.MATH PROFICIENCY STILL BELOW PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELSThe 24% average passing rate for math in 2023 is still lower than the 31% in 2019, indicating that math scores have still not fully recovered from pandemic learning loss.Despite average passing rates in math still not being as high as in 2019, they have gone up since dropping to 15% in 2021. Proficiency increased by 6 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and 3 percentage points from 2022 to 2023.Not every county had an improvement, as there are four counties that saw a decline in average math proficiency from 2022 to 2023: Baltimore, Kent, Somerset and Talbot.Baltimore County Public Schools Board of Education Member at Large Tiara Booker-Dwyer said that an explanation for the slower improvement in math scores is that the format of math questions in these tests have become more layered, which makes it difficult for parents, teachers and administrators trained in the traditional format to help students get accustomed.HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED STUDENTS LAG BEHINDDespite making improvements over the last two years, average scores for historically underserved students in English and math still lag behind. The most recent scores of Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino and American Indian/Alaska Native students are still below those of white and Asian students.Booker-Dwyer said that it is important to build the cultural competency of educators so that they can connect better with students.\"When you look at the curriculum that was developed, it speaks to a certain demographic.There are certain people who just 'I'm not going to connect with this,' so it's going to go in one ear and out the other. Or when they try to connect to it, people recognize that it's inauthentic,\" Booker-Dwyer said.Booker-Dwyer states that another solution is encouraging more historically underserved students to take honors and AP classes, as well as providing resources to schools to give them these opportunities.\"What the research shows is that if you're placed in an advanced academic class or gifted class, even if you're earning C's in there, you're better off long term than if you're just in the standard class,\" Booker-Dwyer said.\"Sometimes it's just exposure to certain things, just being in a classroom, around students who are performing at a certain level will kind of unintentionally make you perform at a higher level,\" she said.GRADE 8 SCIENCE PROFICIENCY HITS FIVEYEAR LOWScience scores continue to lag, especially for grade 8.In grade 5, science proficiency in the last five years peaked in 2021 at 41%, a 12-percentage point increase from 2019. In 2022, the passing rate dropped to 31% before rising again to 35% in 2023, according to MSDE.Grade 8 scores have been on a steady decline since 2021, with the passing rate dropping from 35% in 2022 to 26% in 2023, the lowest it's been in the last five years.With the exception of Dorchester, every county had at least a 10% decline in grade 8 science proficiency from 2022 to 2023. Six counties had over a 30% decrease from 2022: Kent, Charles, Prince George's, Washington, Allegany and Queen Anne's.MSDE states that this decline is likely due to the grade 8 students being in grade 6 during the 2020-2021 school year, which was predominantly online. As a result, students missed key science instruction during their first year of middle school.\"The results on the grade 8 assessment make clear the impact of grade 6 and 7 disruptions on a cumulative grade 8 assessment,\" MSDE said in the press release.Booker-Dwyer stated that rollout for the new Next Generation Science Standards for K-12 education, which has lessons in engineering, technology, earth and space sciences in addition to traditional sciences, was delayed by the pandemic.She remains optimistic that scores will improve as curriculum continues to change.\"I do believe it will get better as people are getting more and more comfortable with the science standards and more teachers are getting trained and the resources are getting better, as far as the instructional material,\" Booker-Dwyer said. \"But initially it was tough.\" The 2024 MCAP tests are set to begin in the spring. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "School principals prepare for the Blueprint For Maryland's Future\n\n November 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Cait Kelley And Caley Fox Shannon | Page: 12 | Section: News \n \n 777\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OCEAN CITY - As Maryland rolls out the 2021 landmark education reform law called the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, many school administrators are unsure what the plan means for their schools.At the annual School Leaders Conference held Nov. 2-4 in Ocean City, state officials and school principals reviewed the details of the Blueprint and discussed how it will be implemented in each school district.The wave of impending policy changes are meant to address the challenges facing educators and students across the state.The Blueprint is grounded in the analysis of a group of independent policy experts formed by the state in 2016 to establish a baseline for education reform.The group was commonly referred to as the Kirwan Commission after its chair, William E. Kirwan, chancellor emeritus of the University System of Maryland.By 2019, the Kirwan Commission had come to some sobering conclusions about Maryland's education system.Half of all teachers leave the profession within the first five years. Only two out of every five kindergarteners arrive in the classroom ready to learn. And just a third of students leave high school being \"college and career ready\" in English and math.\"That was pre-pandemic.So generally speaking, it's gotten worse,\" said Rachel Hise, a policy specialist who worked for the state in tandem with the Kirwan Commission.Explaining the commission's findings to school leaders in Ocean City, she said the independent body concluded that \"ultimately, the status quo is unsustainable.\"The Maryland General Assembly passed the Blueprint for Maryland's Future in February 2021, overriding a veto by then-Gov.Larry Hogan, a Republican who had cost concerns about the plan.The Blueprint allocates $3.8 billion to schools over the next 10 years.Hise is now executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board. She said the policy changes will make sure students are ready to learn in kindergarten and ready to succeed when they graduate high school.Because public schools lack the capacity to fulfill this mandate alone, the state will fund programming via private pre-K providers as well.\"The goal is a socioeconomically integrated pre-K system that is publicly funded, but that is provided by both public schools and private providers,\" Hise told administrators in Ocean City.The Blueprint will also mean big changes in high schools.\"What the Blueprint really envisions is we want kids to be college and career ready by 10th grade, so that the second two years of high school students can focus on the pathway that they're interested in pursuing,\" Hise said.The Blueprint aims to meet this goal through curriculum changes in English and math in addition to apprenticeships and technical education programs.Implementing the Blueprint at the school level falls squarely on school administrators, said Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\"There was no doubt that the Blueprint would be a part of this conference, and the understanding of the Blueprint is actually key,\" she said in an interview.After learning more about the Blueprint at the conference, some principals said they are hopeful that the reforms will address their schools' priorities.Teachers are struggling to make do with salaries in the current economy, said Principal Ryan Daniel of Fort Foote Elementary in Prince George's County.\"I know a lot of my teachers have to have after-school jobs or second jobs to compensate for their salary,\" she said.The Blueprint will raise the minimum salary for teachers to $60,000 across the state by 2026. And if teachers obtain National Board Certification, the Blueprint allows them to earn up to an additional $17,000 per year.Other schools have yet to feel the concrete impact of the Blueprint.\"Honestly, I'm still reading and learning, and I think that they're doing a really slow roll out intentionally for us, which is good,\" said Jamie Miller, the principal at Broadneck Elementary in Arnold. \"We have people at the board level who are becoming sort of experts and then they're going to disseminate to us.\"Miller expressed a mix of excitement about the expansion of pre-K and trepidation about her school's capacity to meet the need.In March 2023, every school district submitted a detailed plan to the Accountability and Implementation Board for rolling out the Blueprint in their schools.\"The plans are fine, but they really are a baseline,\" Hise said. \"There's a need for more innovative thinking.\"The Accountability and Implementation Board expects updated plans from every district in March 2024, and has offered every district a $100,000 grant to hire a strategic planning expert. All but Frederick and Worcester counties took the state up on that deal. \n \n Caption: Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board, presents on Maryland's plan to improve early childhood education. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Fretterd Community Center.A number of Caroline County Public School sophomores had the opportunity to visit with representatives from a variety of businesses and attend workshops to help them explore career possibilities before they graduate from high school.Hosted by the Rotary Club of Denton, the 10th Grade Career Exploration Fair was sponsored by Smiles by Holsinger, Shore United Bank, Summit Community Bank and Sisk Fulfillment.The Denton Rotary has been providing this yearly event to 10th grade students since 2013; however, the COVID pandemic temporarily suspended it.\"The purpose of the event is to spark an interest and open up career possibilities to our 10th graders so they can be career ready when they graduate,\" said Sue Simmons, a Denton Rotarian and the event chair.This year was the highest attendance ever, with 97 students from Colonial Richardson High School, North County High School and the Caroline Career and Technology Center, who were split up into groups for the day. Nearly 30 small and large businesses set up vendor exhibits.Each group was assigned to a table with a business mentor - an adult to help match them with possible careers that are compatible with their interests or expose them to new ideas and opportunities to consider.Students were encouraged to explore careers that match their personal interests, such as working outside, being a problem solver, caring for others or owning their own business.Each student also attended two of the four workshops that were offered. Workshops included \"Unlocking Your Potential at Chesapeake College\" by Marci Leach, director of program development at Chesapeake Community College, and J.P. Kelly, business and industry navigator at Chesapeake Community College; \"Mental Health Means Inner Wealth\" by Sara Porter-Lepore, LCSW-C, and Cara Calloway, mental health coordinator for CCPS; \"How To Rock a Job Interview\" by Deborah Boulden, youth outreach coordinator for the Upper Shore Workforce Investment Board; and \"Way to Be: Exploring Career Interests\" by Abigail Trice, Next Generation Scholars coordinator for Caroline County.Participating students also had the opportunity to meet students from other schools, as each group was pre-assigned to their tables by Lindsey McCormick, CCPS director of college and career.Ten juniors who attended the fair last year returned as mentors to help guide the sophomores through the day.A bonus to the program was a special visit from Devon Beck, an NCHS graduate, songwriter, hip hop artist, podcaster and Talbot County Public Schools Equity Facilitator. Beck shared with the students his own story and provided a positive message about being true to themselves and finding a career that is meaningful to them.The Rotary Club of Denton thanked Dr. Derek Simmons, McCormick and Robert Gowen from the CCPS Board of Education; Eric Cook, Ann Ferkler, and Brad Plutschak from CCPS; as well as table mentors Danielle Forrest of Shore United, Linda Prochaska of Appleseed Books, Victor Reynolds of CASA of Caroline, Richard Warfield of the Caroline Review, Esther Curtis of SUN Behavioral Health), Desiree Jefferson and America McKinney of His Hope Ministries, Kristi English of APG Media Chesapeake, Angel Perez of the Caroline Culinary Arts Center, Kat Stork of Shore Strategies LLC, and Sarah Kilmon of Talbot County Communications. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF DENTON ROTARY\n \nCaroline County sophomore explore career options with local businesses and organizations Nov. 21. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Superintendent Outlines Budget Priorities, Timeline\n\n December 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; Cconnolly@Chespub.Com | Page: 15 | Section: News \n \n 785\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - The conundrum of uncertain Blueprint demands coupled with a projected decrease in pandemic-related grant funding for Caroline County Public Schools is proving to be a challenge for Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons, school administrators and district staff as they build a budget for fiscal year 2025.And because the dilemma impacts the traditional budgeting timeline employed in previous years, at the Dec. 5 meeting of the Caroline County Board of Education, the Superintendent Simmons received more time to develop a more realistic budget.\nThe Board of Education approved Simmons's request to revise the traditional timeline and move his final budget proposal from February to April.\n\"We do not have a good idea of what state revenues look like until the General Assembly gets done doing their work, which is April,\" Simmons said.\nWhile some demands of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a set of policies and spending for education in the state's public schools, are clear, others are still being modified. The \"uncertainties\" of the unfunded legislative mandate have created budgetary challenges for school administrators across the state.\nOne of the demands for school districts is funding dual enrollment for high school students who wish to take college courses. Blueprint's College and Career Readiness standards require school districts to pay for any student who meets the minimum requirements for dual enrollment. At roughly $1,000 per student per semester, CCPS spent $130,000 in 2023 for juniors and seniors to take courses at Chesapeake College. While \"it's great for the kids,\" Simmons said, the Blueprint requirement presents a budget challenge.\nAnother \"cost of doing Blueprint business\" is meeting the mandated starting teacher salary of $60,000 by fiscal year 2027.\nGrant funding \"is kind of how Caroline County has survived,\" Simmons said.\nBut some of that funding will decrease or cease altogether in 2024.\nBoth American Rescue Plan and Maryland Leads grant funding will sunset in Sept. 2024. In addition, the funding formula for Blueprint shows a 1.7% increase in state funding from last year, the lowest per year increase in the formula, Simmons said.\nThe CCPS budget, typical of school systems across the state is 80% people, Simmons said.\n\"The rule of thumb is anywhere between 80% to 90% of your budget is people, and when you take people out and you take out paying for your electric and your fuel and heating your buildings and running your buses and those sorts of things, you're probably left with somewhere between the neighborhood of 5% to 7% every year that truly is discretionary,\" Simmons said.\nAnd while \"about 14% of our money comes from the county government, the rest of it comes from state and federal, which is also why those numbers are important,\" he said.\nMost categories in Blueprint require financing at the school level, adding additional elements of complexity and compliance, and requiring full time accounting level position, Simmons said.\nBesides Blueprint's requirements, budget pressures also include the rate of inflation at over 3.5%, multiyear contracts that will come up for renewal in 2024 that will likely be higher than the rate of inflation and global issues impacting the cost of goods, including fuel.\nHowever, the budgeting challenge is not \"all doom and gloom,\" Simmons said.\nCaroline County has schools that qualify for \"concentration of poverty\" grant funding. While the funding is restricted to individual schools and can't support programs or positions at the district level, it helps take some pressure off the district to fund, for example, an afterschool program or reading intervention at a specific school.\nFederalsburg and Greensboro elementary schools already qualify; Colonel Richardson Middle School received its first concentration of poverty grant in 2023.\n\"It's likely we will see multiple other schools added as the Free and Reduced Meals rates maintain or increase,\" Simmons said. Because the concentration of poverty funding formula relies on Free and Reduced Meals data, Simmons said, \"I feel very confident all nine of our schools will get there.\"\nAs for the budgeting process, Simmons and his team will continue to work on the budget, try to find funding sources and work with the County finance office into 2024. Negotiating with the teachers' association will play a role, as well as a joint budget meeting with the Caroline County Commissioners.\n\"We also have a very good working relationship with the county commissioners,\" Simmons said. \"We are not one of those counties that walks over to the county commissioners and drops an additional increase of $3, 4 or 5 million on them.\" The final CCPS budget is due to the county commissioners by the end of June.\nPriorities in the fiscal year 2025 CCPS budget are competitive salaries and benefits for all employees, maintaining reasonable staffing levels across the district, maintaining high yield positions and programs that were included in pandemic-related grants and implementing the Blueprint as required. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Com | Page: 2 | Section: News \n \n 937\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - At a Talbot County Board of Education meeting Wednesday, administrators gave an update on the school system's priorities.Talbot County Public Schools' three priorities, identified in the spring, are academic equity and achievement, fostering an engaging environment and hiring and retaining highly qualified and diverse staff.\nSince sharing the priorities with the entire school system in August, Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said they have been working to \"infuse\" the priorities everywhere.\n\"In my roundtables, out in the community, in schools,\" she said. \"We're constantly talking about those three priorities.\"\nAt the meeting, strategies and metrics associated with each priority were shared.\nACADEMIC EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT When it comes to academic equity and achievement, TCPS has six strategies, including implementing additional interventions for students in and outside the classroom, hiring additional math coaches and implementing more assessments to measure growth.\nAssistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction Helga Einhorn said that since improving math was identified as a priority by the board, the district has added the NWEA MAP Growth Assessment for mathematics.\n\"Prior to this year, we did not have a standardized assessment that would allow us to collect this type of data as we had with reading,\" Einhorn said. \"We felt it was important, if we were going to make changes throughout the year, to progress monitor our students throughout the year.\"\nStudents in kindergarten through fifth grade took the beginning of the year MAP Growth Assessment for mathematics.\nEinhorn said teachers were impressed with how well students performed.\nOverall, 14% of those students were in the 80th percentile or higher, 19% were between the 61st and 80th percentile, 18% were between the 41st and 60th percentile, 21% were between the 21st and 40th percentile and 25% were between the 1st and 20th percentile.\nAlong with measuring growth through testing throughout the year, Einhorn said teachers are working very closely with the K-6 Math Curriculum Supervisor Daisy Bradwell.\n\"They are doing a deep dive into the curriculum,\" Einhorn said, adding that Bradwell is working with teachers to identify what things might be missing from the curriculum.\nFOSTERING AN ENGAGING ENVIRONMENT Director of Student Services Darlene Spurrier started off her presentation by listing different strategies the district is employing to achieve fostering an engaging environment.\nThese strategies include school-based mental health services and substance abuse intervention and prevention; restorative practices training; and individual school wellness plans and wellness coaches.\n\"Many of (these strategies) are ongoing and will not ever really move to completed because they're things that we're just going to continue to do,\" she said.\nWhen it came to data, Spurrier shared the results of three climate surveys - an internal survey from this year and the Maryland School Climate Surveys from last year and the year before that. Each of the surveys measure student and educator attitudes on four domains: community, environment, relationships and safety.\nComparing the student survey TCPS took this year to the state's survey from last year, within those four domains, students considered physical safety, physical environment and participation and engagement significantly better this year than the previous two years.\nComparing the teacher survey TCPS took this year to the state's survey from last year, teachers also ranked participation and engagement and physical safety significantly higher. They also ranked substance abuse higher than last year, meaning it is less of a concern in schools this year. Teachers ranked bullying lower on the scale this year compared to last year, meaning it is more of a concern.\nHIGHLY QUALIFIED AND DIVERSE STAFF Assistant Superintendent for Administrative and Support Services Lynne Duncan presented data on new hires, recruitment and TCPS's Grow Your Own Teachers Scholarship Program.\nBefore she spoke, Pepukayi said that retaining, not just recruiting, is important to the district.\n\"With the shortages across our nation in education, we want to make sure the people who are here, we're tending to,\" she said.\nAccording to Duncan's presentation, last school year, 197 out of 234 people, or 84%, accepted offers of employment.\nThis year, 90 out of 126 people, or 71%, accepted offers of employment.\nDuncan said that, to date, four of those new hires this year have left employment.\nIn terms of demographics of new teaching staff this year, 32 teachers are white and two are Hawaiian.\nTCPS attended seven recruitment fairs last school year. Duncan said it yielded one support staff employee.\nThe district plans to attend a total of eight recruiting events this school year. So far, it has visited three.\nOf the five people enrolled in the district's Grow Your Own Teachers Scholarship Program last year, four have been hired. The program gives TCPS students enrolled in college a scholarship if they agree to teach in the district after they graduate. Duncan said that of the nine remaining students enrolled in the program, one will graduate this month, one will graduate in June of 2024, three will graduate in 2026 and four will graduate in 2027.\nAt the end of the meeting, board member Jymil Thompson said he could see that the administrative team has clear vision, alignment and transparency.\n\"I think you all do a fabulous, fabulous job of that,\" he said. \"I want to see where the district's going to be in a couple years because I think it's definitely trickling in the right direction. So I'm anxious to be a part of that.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TRO VATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi speaks at a Board of Education meeting Dec. 13 in Easton.\n\n MAGGIE TRO VATO/MTRO VATO@CHESPUB.COM\n\n Talbot County Board of Education President Emily Jackson (pictured) and Vice President Candace Henry were reelected as president and vice president during a board meeting Dec. 13. \"It's a pleasure to serve in this role, and I'm excited to do it again for another year,\" Jackson said at the meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Kids made ice cream cones or enjoyed hot chocolate with their parents.\nThe children were happy to get a bag of Christmas items to take home. All of them were gifted with a \"Nice List Certification\" directly from the desk of Santa Claus.\nInfants received a bag with the new logo of the Kent County Infants and Toddlers program: a giraffe. Each bag came with the book, \"The Giraffe Who Found Its Spots,\" by Adisan Books, and a plush giraffe to nuzzle over the holidays.\nParents and friends interacted with professionals in the field over pizza, cookies and tiny juice boxes.\nElizabeth Tussing the Family Resource Center's parent coordinator and organizer said, \"This year we have Santa, and it's good because kids can receive individualized time with him. It's not a long line so they don't feel the pressure.\" Also in attendance were staff from all three Judy Centers in Kent County: Rock Hall, Chestertown and the newest, Galena.\nProfessionals from the Family Resource Center and Special Education Citizens Advisory Committee, (SECAC) were there, helping with the event and being a positive presence.\nFor those in the community interested, SECAC meets on the fourth Wednesday of each month at the Kent County Middle School.\nOn Jan. 24, starting at 5 p.m, Parents Place of Maryland will teach on the transition process for student's Individualized Educational Plans. \n \n Caption: WILL BONTRAGER\n\n Dad and mom, Michael and Aimee Boumiea cheer on their sons Benjamin as he creates his Christmas cookie and Emmett (not pictured).\n\n WILL BONTRAGER\n\n Supervisor of Special Education Wendy Keen and Coordinator of Special Education Erica Costa-Gooding match Emmett Boumiea's cheerful smile.\n\n WILL BONTRAGER\n\n Everybody can gather around Santa, even adults, especially dedicated ones like these educational professionals.

    "content": "Stepping into the past - Museum explores Tubman's life through murals\n\n December 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 941\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - In the back of the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center on Race Street, one wall acts as a window into Tubman's life.Inside the museum, on one side of the wall, Tubman is painted as a young girl, about 13-years-old, at the Bucktown General Store.\n\"This was a pivotal time in her life,\" Linda Harris, the museum's director of events and docent, said. \"It was considered her first act of defiance.\" Outside the museum, on the other side of the wall, Tubman is an adult, holding out her hand.\n\"(She's) coming back, rescuing family and those that wanted freedom,\" artist of both murals, Michael Rosato said.\nHarriet Tubman, an abolitionist and social activist who was born into and escaped from slavery in Dorchester County in the 19th century, became well-known for her work on the Underground Railroad, a network of routes and safe houses that helped enslaved people escape to their freedom.\nInside the museum, the mural of a young Tubman and the Bucktown Store covers the entire wall - and the other three walls in the room.\nWith canvas and paint, Rosato has transformed the back room of the museum into the Bucktown Store, a significant place in Tubman's history.\nThe story goes that Tubman was asked to go to the Bucktown Store to get something for the master.\n\"And she didn't want to do it,\" Bill Jarmon, president of the Harriet Tubman Organization, said.\n\"Part of it had to do with the fact that she wasn't presentable.\" It had to do with her hair, Jarmon said. So she covered her hair with a cloth made from flaxseed.\nWhen Tubman got to the store, she heard a noise at the backdoor and saw a young boy struggling to get away from his master. When the boy escapes and runs toward the door, Tubman is told to stop him. But she doesn't. She steps out of the way to let him go through. \"Her first act of defiance,\" as Harris said.\nAs the boy escaped, Jarmon said, a two-pound weight was thrown at him.\nHowever, the weight hit Tubman in the forehead instead, knocking her unconscious.\nHarris considers Tubman's head wrap to be a very important piece of this story.\n\"She wraps her head in this linen made of flaxseed, which in fact - what I'm reading and what I believe now - cushions the blow from that two-pound weight being hurled at her,\" Harris said.\n\"Imagine if she had fixed her hair that day. She'd be dead.\" Sitting in the back room of the museum Wednesday, Dec. 20, Jarmon and Harris pointed to different parts of the room as they told the story. When they officially open this part of the museum - which they hope to do in January - visitors will feel even more immersed in the story.\nThey plan to put in wood floors and counters to resemble the store. And as they tell the story of Tubman's first act of defiance, Harris said she and her husband will play code songs, songs enslaved people used to share messages.\nEventually, Harris hopes to offer virtual reality goggles to visitors when they enter the room.\n\"We're going to make this thing come alive,\" she said.\nThe idea to do this all started when Harris learned that she would no longer be able to take visitors on tours inside the original Bucktown Store.\nHarris said that considering how pivotal the store was in Tubman's life, she couldn't have people visit and not learn the story.\n\"So I said, 'Well, let's put it in the museum,'\" Harris said.\nTo begin the project, Rosato, who lives in Church Creek and has been an artist for 33 years, went to the store and took photos of the walls.\n\"Every square inch of the walls and what was on the shelves,\" he said.\nAfter that, he took the photos back to his studio on Race Street and put paint to canvas.\n\"(I) just started to recreate the store as close as possible and in a somewhat realistic fashion so when you're in that space you feel as though you can take things off the shelves,\" he said.\nAfter completing each wall on the canvas, he would bring the canvases to the museum and glue them to the walls so that it looked as if he had painted directly on walls of the museum. To make it look as realistic as possible, Rosato had to consider light, shadow and perspective.\n\"When you create a painting that you want to look real and dimensional, you have to understand perspective and find the right vanishing point,\" he said.\n\"So when you're standing right in the middle of that room, every wall you look at, all the lines converge to a certain point. And that's what gives it a sense of depth.\" The project, which Rosato worked on in the fall, took between one and two months to complete.\nHe said that once it is open to visitors, he hopes they will get a sense of the rich history of Tubman's experience in Dorchester County.\n\"The possibility of being able to stand there and reflect back like, 'I'm in the store where she is.\nThis is what happened,'\" he said. \"And then going outside and seeing (adult) Harriet Tubman. This is the outcome.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center director of events and docent Linda Harris and Harriet Tubman Organization President Bill Jarmon pose in front of the new mural in the museum in Cambridge on Dec. 20.\n\n MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n The mural inside the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center on Race Street in Cambridge on Dec. 20.\n\n MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n The mural inside the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center on Race Street in Cambridge depicts the story of Tubman's \"first act of defiance.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Two years after the Maryland General Assembly transferred responsibility for incarcerated students' education from the state Education Department to an independent school board within the Juvenile Services Department, students confined in Maryland's secure youth facilities continue to face multiple long-standing challenges, according to experts and state audit reports.\nTeacher vacancy rates of 30% in the most populous Juvenile Services schools have led to reliance on streaming instruction in subjects such as math and science.\nDavid Domenici, director of education and senior adviser to the Juvenile Services secretary, said streaming instruction is \"not ideal\" for the \"vast majority\" of students but better than packets of photocopied activities.\nJuvenile Services teacher vacancies have persisted through tensions between Maryland's education and Juvenile Services agencies over the past decade about who bears responsibility for educating incarcerated young people and how best to do so. Those vacancies continue through teachers' lack of summer and winter breaks and low pay relative to teachers employed by local school districts.\nBills seeking pay parity and summer breaks for juvenile services teachers failed in 2016, 2019 and 2020, often pitting experts from Education and Juvenile Services against each other. The General Assembly established a statewide education board within Juvenile Services in 2021 in response to monitors' and advocacy groups' repeated findings of high staff turnover and vacancies, inadequate services for learning disabled students and a lack of support for students returning to community schools.\nBut the law did not require pay parity or align facilities' teaching calendar more closely with local schools.\nBut lost instructional time is greatest due to a lack of residential advisers, according to audits of Juvenile Services schools by the state Office of the Inspector General.\nDepartmental policy requires that residential staff escort students from their living units to classrooms while maintaining a minimum staff-to-youth ratio. When there aren't enough residential staff, students don't move.\nStudents were late to class 203 times across Juvenile Services facilities due to residential staff shortages between April and June alone, according to the audits. Teachers had to teach class inside the living units 43 times in the 90-day inspection period.\nGetting students in the classroom, even if they are late, Domenici said, is better than class on the living units.\nThe department is working toward a goal of 90% on-time attendance in school by shifting all onsite adults to escort students to school, he said. \n \n Caption: DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE SERVICES/ERIC SOLOMON\n\n Principal Todd Rasher congratulates a graduate at the Victor Cullen Center, a youth committed placement center run by Maryland's Juvenile Services Department in Sabillasville, on Oct. 18, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Radcliffe Creek School awarded 'social-emotional' learning grant\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Local News \n \n 534\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Radcliffe Creek School (RCS) was recently awarded a grant from the Queen Anne's County Mental Health Committee (QACMHC) to expand its social-emotional learning curriculum. The new funding will broaden the robust curriculum already in place for younger students, bringing social-emotional resources to older students and their parents, as well as to the local community.Social-emotional skills serve as a guide for people to understand social situations and relationships: these abilities are central to navigating the world successfully in everyday life. Debbie Cohee-Wright, a special education learning specialist at RCS explained, \"If a child has a mental health issue of any kind, such as trauma, depression or anxiety, their ability to learn and access information is compromised. For a student to be available for learning, they must first feel emotionally safe. Making connections with teachers and peers and building trust with others must happen before the focus on academics can take place.\"\nCurrently, the school's social-emotional learning program encompasses two curriculums targeted to younger students who are identified as needing support to strengthen these skills. The program, administered by Intervention Transition Skills Coach Bryn Ponti, utilizes fun, engaging activities that integrate kid- friendly themes: kids imagine themselves as detectives who look for clues in their environment or as superheroes who earn superpowers, all while learning about executive functioning, perspective taking and self-regulation.\nHead of School Peter Thayer said, \"At RCS, we always try to meet students where they are in their learning, and here, that includes their social-emotional wellbeing. This grant from QACMHC will make a considerable difference in the lives of our older students and their families, many of whom are neurodivergent and need extra support in this area.\"\nThe funding provided by QACMHC will bring two additional curriculums—Brain Talk and Conscious Discipline—to the school, expanding its social-emotional programming to older students and their families.\nBrain Talk is a curriculum designed to teach students about the different areas of their brains, educating children about their executive function capabilities and how they impact responses to situations.\nConscious Discipline is a course designed for teachers, parents and guardians, providing adults with tools to show children better ways to self-regulate and build resilience.\n\"These grants are made possible by community support of our fundraisers and through generous donations from local businesses and individuals,\" QACMHC President Kelly Phipps said. \"We appreciate the outpouring of support whenever we have a fundraiser or ask for donations.\"\nIn addition to the new resources this grant will provide to Radcliffe Creek School's teachers, students and their families, the QACMHC grant will allow RCS to bring social-emotional programming to the local community as well. Planning is already underway to host an event for the public, bringing this important topic to local parents, teachers and residents in 2024. \"We are so grateful to QACMHC for their support of our school's social-emotional learning program. These funds will directly impact our students' mental health by supporting children both in the classroom and at home, leading to a more positive school environment, a greater sense of empowerment among our teachers and parents, and an increased sense of confidence in our children. We are excited to bring these resources to the Radcliffe Creek School community and beyond in 2024,\" remarked Director of Advancement Carolyn Thompson. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Diving Deep' with dyslexia: Local special education teacher works to raise awareness\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TAMARA FORTE Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 1217\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE — What do Robin Williams, Jay Leno, Albert Einstein, Alexander Graham Bell, Magic Johnson, Jennifer Aniston, Gwen Stefani, Abraham Lincoln, and Arnold Schwarzenegger all have in common? They all have dyslexia.Lindsey Parte, a mother of two boys and Special Education teacher, has reignited the Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter that fizzled out during the Covid pandemic.\nParte shares that she has been \"diving deep into advocating and teaching herself (about dyslexia)\" for the last three years.\nWhen Parte's older son, Lincoln, was six years old, he struggled with both speech and reading. Parte said a red flag to her son's learning struggle was \"knowing how smart he was but not understanding why reading was so hard.\"\nParte explains that her two-year younger son was making gains on her older son. In contrast, reading was coming with ease to her younger son.\nOn the first day of second grade, Lincoln (her older son) came home and said, \"I can't do this. I can't read. I hate school.\" Lincoln was frustrated with learning and wanted to quit.\nIt was heartbreaking for Parte as a mother and as a special education teacher herself as no one wants to see their child struggle, especially with learning. Parte explained, reading is the gateway to learning and lifelong success, and as such, learning to read successfully is vital to all.\nTwo years after Parte first suspected Lincoln was dyslexic, Lincoln got his formal diagnosis. Parte explained that getting the diagnosis meant freedom for her and her son.\nShe recounts, \"I will never forget the utter sigh of relief when we told him he has dyslexia. It all made sense to him from that moment on. Within a week, he was already talking about it in class and advocating for himself. And most importantly, we got our boy back. His light turned back on.\"\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, dyslexia is \"a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). Also called a reading disability, dyslexia is a result of individual differences in areas of the brain that process language.\"\nAn MRI shows the physical differences in the brain composition of a dyslexic thinker versus a non-dyslexic thinker. Dyslexia is so common that one in five people are a dyslexic learners.\nWhat is it like to have dyslexia? How can I help and support a dyslexic learner? What are the early indicators of dyslexia? These questions and many others will be answered at 6:30 p.m., Feb. 20, at the \"Experience Dyslexia: A Dyslexia Simulation\" workshop at the Queen Anne's County Library Kent Island Branch location.\nThe free event, hosted by Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter, aims to raise dyslexia awareness, empower families to support their children, encourage educational interventions, and ultimately influence policy makers to support Maryland students with dyslexia.\nAll are welcome. The event will offer six stations to help understand the dyslexic learner: Learn to Read, Listen to Me, Write with Mirrors, Name the Letter, Write or Left, and Unfair Hearing Test.\nParte says,\"The two biggest takeaways I have learned over the last year of my deep dive into my son's brain and the way he learns are early identification is crucial (as young as five-years-old); and the dyslexic brain requires instruction to be explicit, systematic, cumulative and multisensory.\n\"It should integrate the teaching of listening, speaking, reading, spelling, vocabulary, fluency, handwriting and written expression. There should be an emphasis on the structure of language: phonology, orthography, morphology, syntax and semantics. Training teachers and educating parents is also of the utmost importance,\" she continued.\nSince then, Lincoln has helped his mom set up and lead workshops. In October, to celebrate Dyslexia Awareness Month, this mother and son duo led the Halloween-themed workshop entitled \"There is nothing scarier than not being able to read.\"\nParte believes in dyslexia awareness and education with her whole being, which is why she fundraised, on her own, to purchase the upcoming workshop materials.\nAfter more than three years of advocating, Parte promotes all adults to learn as much as they can by listening to podcasts, attending free trainings, reading books and fact sheets, and much more.\nMoving forward, what steps can we take?\n\"Release the stigma. Embrace the label,\" Parte said. \"The label means freedom. It gives a child the right to read. The right to appropriate instruction which in turns means success in reading and regaining self confidence. We got our child back the moment we told him he had dyslexia. The label opens a world of resources for your child to feel good about themselves. Priority is a child's mental and social wellbeing.\"\nDyslexic Learners have many strengths and show a lot of leadership skills. Some other positive skills of dyslexic learners include: problem-solving, big picture thinking, creativity, empathetic, and entrepreneurial skills.\nParte shared things parents can do to help their struggling reader if they suspect their child has dyslexia:\nTesting is everything. You will be surprised how relieved your child is with a \"diagnosis\".\nFinding the right intervention specialist (tutors in reading are not the same as someone trained and certified in structured reading interventions like Orton Gillingham). Tutoring at least three times a week is most effective. The key to remediation is \"go as fast as you can and as slow as you need to\". Early intervention is crucial especially to maintain your child's confidence in school.\nDeep dive in your own research. It will help with advocacy, ensuring the right assessments are being used, and knowing the right questions to vet organizations and other folks who claim to want to help your student.\nRead to your child not so they learn to read but so that they develop their reading comprehension and vocabulary while they are learning to read with appropriate interventions.\nIf your child receives the diagnosis of dyslexia, tell them, she encourages. Share all the amazing qualities a dyslexic thinker has and famous people who have dyslexia. Show them a photograph of a dyslexic brain vs typical brain.\nKnowledge and support in this process are so important. You don't have to go through this emotional journey alone. Connect with your local Decoding Dyslexia chapter.\nParte explains, \"Most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an important role.\nThough there's no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention result in the best outcome. Sometimes dyslexia goes undiagnosed for years and isn't recognized until adulthood, but it's never too late to seek help.\"\nCommunity support, awareness, education, and training will help all our learners learn in the best ways to be successful, happy learners. Together, we can impact our future and the future of our children. If you cannot attend the workshop at the library but are interested in gaining resources and learning more, you can email decodingdyslexiaES@gmail.com for more information and for a Welcome Newsletter with a list of more resources.\nCurrently, Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter is a grassroots movement (not a nonprofit), which means it has no funding and is paid for all out-of-pocket. It is run by parents who are also working professionals.\n\"The fight continues,\" Parte said, \"Until every single child (and their families) don't have to go through this hell and back to learn how to read.\"\nTo support and make a donation to Decoding Dyslexia Maryland Eastern Shore Chapter, you can also email Parte at the email above. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "DCTC Masonry instructor surprised by coworkers on last day\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 738\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — On his last day of teaching at the Dorchester Career and Technology Center, Masonry Instructor Eddie Bailey wasn't the only one sporting a baseball cap, grey sweatshirt and jeans.More than 10 of his coworkers showed up and showed out in Bailey's well-known uniform. Some of his doppelgängers even brought their own fake metal detectors — a hobby of Bailey's.\nAfter eight years teaching at DCTC, Bailey is hanging up his trowel and picking up his metal detector.\n\"You know, I love metal detecting, so I'll probably go find the Holy Grail or something,\" he said about what he will do in his retirement.\nWhen Bailey came in for his last day of teaching, right before winter break began, it took a little while for him to figure out what his coworkers had done.\n\"I'm like, 'Wait a minute, something don't look right,'\" he said. \"Then, when I saw the metal detectors, I was like, 'Ohh, they got me good!'\"\nDCTC Principal Ashley Robinson came up with the idea.\n\"I was just trying to really think about how we could celebrate his time here in a way that he would enjoy and that he would feel appreciated,\" she said. \"So I really thought the best way to do that would be with humor, since that's something he really enjoys.\"\nIn order to keep it a surprise, Robinson said she made it a part of the school's holiday spirit week.\n\"So he thought everyone was just dressing in comfy sweatshirts,\" she said. \"And I let everyone else know we were really just dressing like Mr. Bailey.\"\nBailey, who was surprised by his coworkers' plan, thought it was funny.\n\"It was so great because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said. \"I would have never expected that.\"\nBailey said he knew Robinson had something to do with it.\n\"She comes up with such cool stuff,\" he said, adding that she gave him a plaque with a trowel on it to commemorate his time teaching at DCTC.\nHe said there's a reason he would wear the similar outfit that his coworkers knew so well to work everyday.\n\"Working in the masonry, you can't really go in there with real good clothes on,\" he said. \"You gotta wear your oldest stuff. Like, inside my car, all you see is dust.\"\nRobinson said Bailey, like the rest of DCTC's staff members, epitomizes the importance of CTE education.\n\"The majority of the teachers here have worked in industry in their field, they have those life experiences and then they chose to come back and give back and work with kids to set them up to be successful,\" she said. \"We were happy to have (Bailey) and happy that he was able to do this.\"\nBailey has had a few different careers over the years. He owned a masonry business, was a prison guard and spent four years in the Marine Corps. But teaching is in Bailey's blood. His father taught at James M. Bennett High School in Salisbury.\n\"He was football coach, track coach,\" Bailey said. \"And we lived right across the street from Bennett, so I was at school every day. I knew it from top to bottom.\"\nHe has memories of cigarette smoke \"flying out of the teachers' lounge\" and teachers coming over to his family's house to play cards with his father.\n\"I mean, that was the good old days,\" he said.\nLooking toward his retirement, Bailey has plans to further explore the hobby his DCTC coworkers know he loves.\nBailey said the Career and Technology Center staff knew about his metal detecting because he would send them photos of some of his finds.\nOver the last five years, Bailey said he has gotten more and more into metal detecting. His neighbors, known as The Hoover Boys on YouTube, post metal detecting videos. They have over 100,000 YouTube subscribers. When they moved next door, Bailey said they started giving him their hand-me-downs.\nOver the years, Bailey has found all sorts of things — from shoe buckle frames to Civil War bullets to cannonballs. Two of his major finds were a rare George Washington inaugural button and a pine tree shilling.\nAlthough he has plans to do more detecting, Bailey said he'll miss his students.\n\"A lot of them played sports, and I'd hook them up with a sub,\" he said. \"It was always a sub, a red Gatorade, orange Doritos.\"\nAs he moves on to his next chapter, Bailey now has fond memories of his own teaching experience to look back on.\n\"Oh I loved it,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

All of the county's schools will be operating on a two-hour delay schedule Wednesday, Jan. 10, for evaluation of overnight flooding and storm damage, according to the school system.\nQueen Anne's County Public Schools were also dismissed early Tuesday due to the storm. As of Tuesday afternoon, all of the county's schools are set to run on a 90-minute delayed opening Wednesday, with reevaluation and modifications possible in the morning.\nSchools in Talbot and Caroline counties canceled all after-school activities Tuesday. Both districts are monitoring conditions to determine if delays or closures will be necessary Wednesday.\nThe Caroline County Board of Education meeting will be held as scheduled at 6 p.m. Tuesday.\nGov. Wes Moore enacted a State of Preparedness declaration Tuesday morning, directing the state's department of emergency management to coordinate responses to the storm's impacts.\nRainfall of 1 to 3 inches is possible across the region Tuesday, with the heaviest rain expected Tuesday night before tapering off Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe main concern is the potential for coastal flooding in Talbot and Queen Anne's counties, said Mike Lee, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Philadelphia/Mount Holly office. Dorchester County is also expected to experience significant flooding.\nA coastal flood warning is in effect from 7 p.m. Tuesday to 7 p.m. Wednesday for areas along the lower Chesapeake Bay, including Cambridge, which will see major impact from flooding early Wednesday morning, according to the Weather Service.

    "content": "Superintendent of schools to retire in 2024\n\n January 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 987\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROCK HALL — Superintendent of Kent County Public Schools, Dr. Karen Couch will be retiring at the end of the current school year, effective June 30. The announcement came at this month's Board of Education meeting. Board President Joe Goetz and Vice President Francoise Sullivan were re-elected to their positions during the Jan. 8 meeting as well.Couch said it has been an honor to collaborate with the exceptional team of administrators, teachers, staff and board members.\n\"Our collective commitment to the students and families of this county has been profound,\" Couch said. \"Throughout my tenure, we achieved significant milestones, a testament to our collective dedication to excellence in education. This commitment consistently drove us to adapt and innovate, ensuring our students receive the best education possible.\"\nUpon the delivery of Couch's announcement, Goetz, described the meeting as a \"heavy night\" with the weight of the superintendent's decision in the air.\n\"But you're not gone,\" Goetz told Dr. Couch. \"And we'll have time to celebrate and we'll have time to reflect on where we've been and where we're going.\"\nGoetz said everyone is a link in the chain driving KCPS, with many having come before them and more to follow. He said they will all do the best they can to continue providing students with a top-quality education.\n\"Working with you has been an absolute joy,\" Goetz said to Couch. \"There's been a lot of ups and downs, but we'll celebrate all that as we move forward.\"\nAs a first step in the KCPS leadership transition, the Board of Education is holding a special meeting at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 23 to discuss the search for the next superintendent. The meeting will be held at the KCPS Administrative Building, 5608 Boundary Ave., Rock Hall.\nCouch is retiring in the back half of her third four-year term as the superintendent of KCPS. Her most recent contract renewal was approved in the spring of 2021 for four years.\nShe first came on board at KCPS on July 1, 2013, having led a candidate field of nearly 20 applicants.\nCouch was named the Maryland Superintendent of the Year in 2021. She made her mark on KCPS early, launching a technological revolution by bringing computers and smartboards into classrooms, greatly expanding teachers' and students' access to educational resources.\nShe built a collaborative environment in schools through fostering professional learning communities, which brought teachers together to share best practices to help reach all students.\nShe also made KCPS one of the first school systems in Maryland to adopt universal all-day prekindergarten, giving children an important head start on their education. \"Amidst numerous budgetary challenges, including declining enrollment and limited resources,\nwe remained committed to prioritizing organizational improvements and addressing the diverse needs of our students and staff,\" Couch said.\nShe improved the school buildings themselves through targeted renovations, enhanced safety features like security vestibules and launching the planning process for a new middle school.\n\"During my tenure, we also executed a comprehensive six-year Facilities Strategic Plan,\nrevitalizing educational facilities untouched for over 25 years,\" she said. \"Moreover, we successfully fulfilled preliminary state requirements for the construction of a new middle school while advocating for legislation to increase state funding participation for the project.\"\nSullivan, praised Couch's professionalism in the face of myriad challenges including tight budgets, declining student enrollment and the COVID pandemic. \"You have helped our schools accomplish so much in the time that you've been here and it hasn't been easy,\" Sullivan told Couch. \"You have always been professional and represented our schools really well, and I can only imagine how tough that probably was for some things.\"\nHailing from New Mexico, Dr. Couch previously served from 2001 to 2013 as the superintendent of the Moriarty-Edgewood School District, about an hour east of Albuquerque. In 2010, she was honored as the New Mexico Superintendent of the Year.\nCouch moved to Kent County with a reputation for having turned that rural school district into one of the top-achieving in the state through a focus of continuous school improvement and the incorporation of research-based education programming.\nShe has likewise implemented similar strategies at KCPS, increasing the visibility and participation in the Career and Technical Education (CTE) program at Kent County High School, encouraging the growth of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs and training elementary school teachers in the renowned Orton-Gillingham method of English language arts instruction.\nTrish McGee, the longest serving among the current Board of Education members, was first elected the year after Couch's hiring. McGee covered the search process that saw Dr. Couch come onboard as the associate editor of the Kent County News.\nSpeaking at the Jan. 8 Board meeting, McGee said Couch paid out of her own pocket for travel from New Mexico to Kent County for one of her first interview visits. McGee said that showed just how prepared Couch was willing to go the distance to address the challenges faced by KCPS.\n\"I think every decision she ever made personally and professionally was really about how to move our school district forward,\" McGee said. \"And I can't think of a greater legacy than something like that.\"\nCouch's tenure at KCPS caps off a career in education that began in 1980 when she became a kindergarten teacher in the Las Cruces Public Schools in southern New Mexico. She was then employed by the Alamogordo Public Schools and rose through the ranks in that district from teacher to principal and, ultimately associate superintendent.\nAlong the way, she earned her master's degree and later received her doctorate in educational administration from New Mexico State University.\nCouch said she is confident that KCPS will continue to nurture and inspire every child who walks through its doors and she eagerly anticipates hearing all those future success stories.\n\"As I begin a new chapter, I know that our work has laid a strong foundation for continued student success,\" Couch said. \"The legacy of our efforts is not in the programs we've started or the facilities we've renovated, but in the lives of the students we've touched.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Board of Education discusses proposed budget, Blueprint's affects\n\n January 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 621\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — At a Talbot County Board of Education meeting Wednesday, Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi and Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones went over the proposed fiscal year 2025 budget.At the beginning of their presentation, Pepukayi shared the Board of Education and superintendent priorities. These priorities are to improve economic equity and achievement in math; foster an engaging environment for students and staff; recruit, promote and retain staff and meet the the Blueprint for Maryland's Future objectives.\nThe Blueprint is a plan, passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021, that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state through increasing education funding by $3.8 billion each year over the next 10 years.\nTalbot County Public Schools' current draft fiscal year 2025 budget is $80.03 million. According to the presentation, the proposed budget is $7.98 million more than that of the fiscal year prior.\nAfter Pepukayi spoke, Jones listed where those increases to the budget come from. These include the addition of 16 positions and money set aside to achieve a $60,000 starting salary for teachers by fiscal year 2027, a Blueprint requirement aimed at attracting and retaining high quality and diverse teachers.\nThe district's budget increase in technology devices and software costs is due to the expiration of COVID-19-related grants. Jones said a significant amount of annual technology costs had come out of grant money over the past few years.\n\"Those grants are expiring,\" she said. \"So that translates to an increase in our request for FY25.\"\nAnother reason for the budget increase is the district's community school initiatives for next year.\nAccording to the Maryland State Department of Education, community schools work with community partners, local governments and other stakeholders \"to identify and address structural and institutional barriers to achievement.\" These schools receive Concentration of Poverty Grants, which give schools startup funding and per-pupil dollars to sustain them.\nJones said Easton Middle School will be coming on as a new community school and that Easton Elementary School is in its third year as a community school. She said the cost increases for these initiatives are mainly payroll related.\nJones said there are two potential reductions that could be made to the proposed budget that would save about $259,000 \"without impacting student learning.\"\nThe first possible reduction would be to bring down the budget line for dual enrollment. Jones said the district realized, after getting the bill from Chesapeake College, that it had overestimated costs — particularly for instruction materials.\nThe second possible reduction would be to pay over time for a new school bus the district intends to buy, rather than paying for the bus in full.\nAfter the presentation, Board President Emily Jackson asked if it was possible for the district to quantify how much of that $7.98 million increase directly applies to the Blueprint.\n\"I want to make sure we are telling our story in a way that is effective to the people who have to go and approve the budget and understand why we are asking for this much more money,\" she said.\nJones said Jackson's ask is a challenge because the Blueprint is \"so embedded in what we're doing\" that it's hard to differentiate which costs are tied to the Blueprint and which aren't. But, she said that, of the 16 new positions, she could say which were specifically tied to the Blueprint.\nBoard Vice President Candace Henry said past cuts to the budget could speak to the Blueprint's affect on the proposed fiscal year 2025 budget.\n\"We could speak to things that we've had to cut out of previous years, and now — because of Blueprint — we have to have,\" she said. \"So I think we can use some of that information to tell that story to the public as well.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Superintendent shares schools' budget constraints with Commissioners\n\n January 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: Local News \n \n 512\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Caroline County Public Schools officials shared good news and bad news with the Caroline County Commissioners at a Jan. 16 meeting.The good news: Caroline County Public Schools ended the year with a $3.25 million surplus.\nThe not-so-good news: The Blueprint for Maryland's Future unfunded mandate puts the fiscal squeeze on the budget and pandemic-based grant funding disappears in fiscal year 2025, officials said.\nChief Finance Officer Erin Thornton and Superintendent Dr. Derek Simmons shared with the commissioners what they need to prepare for as the school district's budget planning continues.\n\"We have always been good stewards of the money and we're fiscally conservative, trying not to just spend money just to spend it, so we were prepared to end the year with money on the books,\" Thornton said.\nThe unassigned fund balance is currently at $9.5 million, \"which is approximately 8.4% of our current operating budget,\" she said. \"Our target range for a fund balance is one to 10%. So, we are approaching a high, which is where we want to be.\"\nCommissioner Frank Bartz asked about maintaining support services salaries, something that he said is not addressed in the Blueprint.\n\"A lot of people in the county work for support services,\" he said. \"I just want to make sure that they're taken care of.\"\n\"You're spot on,\" Simmons said. \"The Blueprint addresses teachers only and leaves out two-thirds of our workgroup, and (it) does not take into consideration any support staff or administration. Required increases to salaries are … for the most part, to classroom-based teachers with kids on the workload.\"\nSimmons said the Supportive Services Association is a negotiated employee group.\n\"Their contract was ratified to be closed from 2012 until next year, so that has been a closed contract with a required 1% in step every year, and then it's 1% in addition to whatever the teachers get. Their contract comes open next year for us to negotiate.\"\nSimmons said the \"biggest challenge that we're going to see this year\" is the Blueprint formula's increase of 1.7% over last year's budget \"when inflation is currently still running over 3%, and that factors in no increases in health insurance, which is probably 5% to 7% right now, we're hearing.\"\nThat percentage does not factor in any pay increase. Blueprint requires first-year classroom teachers to be earning $60,000 by fiscal year 2027.\n\"After this year, the budget increases roughly 5%,\" Simmons said. \"We're sitting in a different position in our county than some of our colleagues are in others. … A lot of the larger systems are looking at significant cuts of teaching positions because (of) that 1.7% increase. It's a regressive budget no matter how you cut it, when it's only that much of an increase, and the cost of living is definitely a lot higher.\"\nWhen COVID funding and (Maryland) Leads funding \"dries up in September at the same time as we're getting a 1.7% increase, that's the perfect storm,\" Simmons said. \"And again, we'll weather it for our staff. We'll figure it out. I really, truly believe we will. It's just going to be a really tough year.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A student who is emerging readiness has few of those foundational skills and behaviors.\nThe percent of kindergarteners demonstrating readiness went up to 39% this school year from 32% last school year. The year before that, in the 2021-2022 school year, 29% of students were demonstrating kindergarten readiness.\n\"I wish I had some confetti and a little horn to celebrate,\" Colman said about this year's results.\nAlthough the percentage of students demonstrating readiness went up this school year, so did the percentage of students emerging readiness. It was at 38% this school year compared to 30% last year.\nThe percentage of students approaching readiness decreased to 33% this school year from 38% last school year.\nThe district saw an increase in the number of its kindergarteners demonstrating readiness in language and literacy and mathematics, but it saw a decrease in its kindergarteners demonstrating readiness in social foundations and physical well-being and motor development.\n\"I do think that speaks to the level of need for some of our students in the younger grades and the mental health supports that they need, the social development that they need,\" Colman said. \"Those are our COVID babies and I think that kind of hit us here.\"\nSTAR RATINGS\nColman also presented on the different star ratings for each school in the district. Star ratings are given by the state and determined by different academic and school quality indicators.\nAccording to Colman's presentation, every school except for Vienna Elementary School kept it's star rating from the year before. Vienna Elementary went down from four stars in the 2021-2022 school year to three stars in the 2022-2023 school year.\nColman said three DCPS schools that were less than one percentage point away from gaining another star. Those schools were Mace's Lane Middle School, Sandy Hill Elementary School and North Dorchester Middle School. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Student writes graphic novel about Frederick Douglass\n\n January 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 466\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A recent graduate of Washington College, Andrea C. Proimos spent her final semesters at school creating a web-based graphic novel about traveling in the footsteps of Frederick Douglass.This novel, aimed at young adults, is a playful and curious take on a serious subject. The author wrote it in conjunction with her thesis while completing her bachelor's degree in English.\nIn it, there are mixed photographs, fine art, cartoons and mixed media together.\nAfter receiving a $3,000 Sophie Kerr Promise Grant, Proimos and her dog, Zelda, traveled from Easton's farm fields, to the city of Baltimore, to Douglass' gravesite in Rochester, New York. It was travel in search of the famed abolitionist's life story.\n\"This book follows his actual narrative from when Douglass was born to when he escaped to freedom. This tells his biographical story,\" Promios said about her graphic novel, which she wrote with information gleaned from her travels.\nShe marvels at his place in history and her own.\n\"I wonder how many spots Zelda and I stood exactly where Douglass had stood. Each place we went uncovered new information and new stories about Douglass and the early formation of American history. We were able to immerse ourselves in the scenery and make new discoveries through museums, national forest exhibits, books, murals and all kinds of unexpected representations.\"\nThe writer said that she moved to Easton while completing her studies and found herself living right next to history.\n\"When I moved to Easton, they were having a huge debate about a Confederate monument that was still outside of the courthouse. As the community was having this debate, a mural was painted by Michael Rosato. His was the first mural to go up. As I was finishing my thesis statement, Adam Himhoff's mural went up. I was kind of living in the middle of Douglass history that was still going on,\" she said.\nShe said she wrote her thesis on the multi-dimensional nature of Douglas. The book \"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass\" strikes her as more than just a book and was the spine of her paper.\n\"I explored a lot of representations, like statues and graphic representations, because that was important to his image as he was the most photographed man of the 19th century. He was way ahead of his time. He was like the American dream of the underdog,\" she said.\nThe graphic novel contains lots of photographs of primary historical sites and whimsical drawings by Proimos.\n\"I can read the graphic novel with my 9-year-old. She is not going to get everything. It is meant to go with the 'Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass.' But there are cartoony elements in there that are fun and light hearted. It shows you that Frederick Douglass is a relatable person,\" she said.\nTo read her graphic novel, go to: frederickdouglasseaston.blogspot.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's about trying to find a plan that allows that school to continue.\"\nThe situation became sticky last week when a letter about the closing of the school was prematurely sent to the school, which is in the same complex of buildings where the commissioners meet weekly.\n\"That was our mistake,\" Commissioner President Randy Guy said.\nThe school was paying county government $12,000 a year in rent.\nThe commissioners voted Tuesday to end the lease, but Commissioner Eric Colvin was against closing the school.\n\"I've heard the incredible impact the school has had in helping students turn their lives around,\" he said. \"My opposition in ending this lease is that I did not feel as if there were enough alternatives evaluated. I felt that we could have worked with the school a little bit more to try and find a solution and I'm still opposed to it.\"\nA handful of supporters of the school, including alumni, attended the meeting, though no one spoke to the commissioners. When asked, the group said Headmistress Sarah Green was not in attendance.\nOlivia Flynn, one of the supporters, said on Tuesday the school had positively impacted her.\nHer first year at the school she received 52 infractions in one quarter — three are enough to warrant discipline — but that number dwindled rapidly over the next few years and she said graduated as a top student leader in 2018.\n\"It's a process and its a fellowship with the teachers and a mentorship built with the administrators,\" Flynn said in an interview with Southern Maryland News after Tuesday's meeting. \"It helped me deal with conflict, it also helped me build good relationships with people and helped me prepare for life.\"\nFlynn returned to the school which served grades 6 through 12, in 2022 as a history, English and algebra teacher.\nCounty Attorney Buffy Giddens went over a timeline of events, beginning with the school being given a fresh 10-year lease in 2013.\nOn Feb. 28, 2023, the county received an email request from Green to renew the lease as well as fix the AC unit, which was estimated to be about $100,000.\nIn May, an assessment looked at 27 systems, which discovered a host of needed repairs and maintenance. The estimate was $575,000 with the school on the hook for about $250,000.\nFlynn said \"no one else in the school was informed\" of the needed upgrades, despite the school's extensive alumni and parent network.\nThree months later, the commissioners advised Green of the maintenance issues identified in the facilities assessment and requested a financial sustainability plan by the end of 2023.\n\"We wanted to give them a chance to rectify the situation,\" Hewitt said. \"We told them, 'We need to hear from you, we need to hear your plan,' but we didn't hear anything for a couple of months.\"\nGreen was unable to be reached for comment this week by Southern Maryland News.\nHewitt said the school retained an attorney in October.\n\"My first thought was, 'Why are you wasting money on an attorney? We need you to get to work on this,'\" he said. \"Then commissioners are no longer talking to headmistresses, [instead] attorneys are talking to attorneys.\"\nGreen submitted 10-year and 15-year plans on Dec. 22. One of the points in the plan was to apply for a grant, which was dependent on a long-term lease from the county and was due by Jan. 12.\nHewitt said the grant would have provided a maximum of just $100,000, and added most schools receive about $23,000.\n\"Years ago that was a thriving school with hundreds of kids,\" Hewitt said of Leonard Hall, which had 38 students this year before it closed. \"It's not that way anymore. It wasn't the idea that we wanted to close the school. We don't, but the business plan just isn't working.\"\nHewitt added that \"subsidizing the cost of a private school is not in the best interest of all the citizens. It's not fair to the thousands of people who send their kids to public school that the county subsidize a private school.\"\nHewitt said the commissioners have even looked at other locations for the school and added, \"If something can be worked out in the future, we're more than willing to revisit it.\"\nTwitter: @MichaelSoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's about trying to find a plan that allows that school to continue.\"\nThe situation became sticky last week when a letter about the closing of the school was prematurely sent to the school, which is in the same complex of buildings where the commissioners meet weekly.\n\"That was our mistake,\" Commissioner President Randy Guy said.\nThe school was paying county government $12,000 a year in rent.\nThe commissioners voted Tuesday to end the lease, but Commissioner Eric Colvin was against closing the school.\n\"I've heard the incredible impact the school has had in helping students turn their lives around,\" he said. \"My opposition in ending this lease is that I did not feel as if there were enough alternatives evaluated. I felt that we could have worked with the school a little bit more to try and find a solution and I'm still opposed to it.\"\nA handful of supporters of the school, including alumni, attended the meeting, though no one spoke to the commissioners. When asked, the group said Headmistress Sarah Green was not in attendance.\nOlivia Flynn, one of the supporters, said on Tuesday the school had positively impacted her.\nHer first year at the school she received 52 infractions in one quarter — three are enough to warrant discipline — but that number dwindled rapidly over the next few years and she said graduated as a top student leader in 2018.\n\"It's a process and its a fellowship with the teachers and a mentorship built with the administrators,\" Flynn said in an interview with Southern Maryland News after Tuesday's meeting. \"It helped me deal with conflict, it also helped me build good relationships with people and helped me prepare for life.\"\nFlynn returned to the school which served grades 6 through 12, in 2022 as a history, English and algebra teacher.\nCounty Attorney Buffy Giddens went over a timeline of events, beginning with the school being given a fresh 10-year lease in 2013.\nOn Feb. 28, 2023, the county received an email request from Green to renew the lease as well as fix the AC unit, which was estimated to be about $100,000.\nIn May, an assessment looked at 27 systems, which discovered a host of needed repairs and maintenance. The estimate was $575,000 with the school on the hook for about $250,000.\nFlynn said \"no one else in the school was informed\" of the needed upgrades, despite the school's extensive alumni and parent network.\nThree months later, the commissioners advised Green of the maintenance issues identified in the facilities assessment and requested a financial sustainability plan by the end of 2023.\n\"We wanted to give them a chance to rectify the situation,\" Hewitt said. \"We told them, 'We need to hear from you, we need to hear your plan,' but we didn't hear anything for a couple of months.\"\nGreen was unable to be reached for comment this week by Southern Maryland News.\nHewitt said the school retained an attorney in October.\n\"My first thought was, 'Why are you wasting money on an attorney? We need you to get to work on this,'\" he said. \"Then commissioners are no longer talking to headmistresses, [instead] attorneys are talking to attorneys.\"\nGreen submitted 10-year and 15-year plans on Dec. 22. One of the points in the plan was to apply for a grant, which was dependent on a long-term lease from the county and was due by Jan. 12.\nHewitt said the grant would have provided a maximum of just $100,000, and added most schools receive about $23,000.\n\"Years ago that was a thriving school with hundreds of kids,\" Hewitt said of Leonard Hall, which had 38 students this year before it closed. \"It's not that way anymore. It wasn't the idea that we wanted to close the school. We don't, but the business plan just isn't working.\"\nHewitt added that \"subsidizing the cost of a private school is not in the best interest of all the citizens. It's not fair to the thousands of people who send their kids to public school that the county subsidize a private school.\"\nHewitt said the commissioners have even looked at other locations for the school and added, \"If something can be worked out in the future, we're more than willing to revisit it.\"\nTwitter: @MichaelSoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Education needed on the juvenile crime law\n\n February 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPEHN RIDEOUT | Section: Columns \n \n 732\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Maryland Juvenile Interrogation Protection Act that passed under the Hogan Administration has raised some concerns. While it appears that this law was carefully written and training materials were provided, the complaints seen in the news seem to indicate that insufficient training was provided to the police or the states' attorneys about its implementation.From my experience in Virginia, I know that when new legislation passes that makes significant changes to laws involving children, training on that legislation, before it goes into effect, is an important part of making a smooth transition to the new law. It appears that the time between the passage of this law and its implementation was sufficient to provide that training but may not have been done. At the same time, taking a second look at new laws to make minor changes is not unusual or out of the ordinary.\nAs I have thought about this law, one thing that is not being discussed with regard to concerns is how there is a significant difference between how children should be advised of their rights and questioned and how adults are advised of their rights. They are not the same. Children are not simply small adults.\nSoon after becoming a juvenile court judge, I received training in a number of areas relating to children. One of them related to child development. Others were about ages when children are able to understand certain concepts and how to question children in a way that is age appropriate. The \"Handbook on Questioning Children: A Linguistic Perspective\" by Anne Grantham Walker was our guidebook as new judges.\nIt helped us understand what concepts children could understand at different developmental stages and ages in their lives and how to ask questions of them in a way that they understood so they could give truthful answers. When they were called to testify and take the oath to \"tell the truth,\" I often had to ask them simple questions so that they understood what \"telling the truth\" meant. During trials, it was interesting to hear how police officers and lawyers would ask questions and get answers that seemed to mean one thing to them and mean something different to me.\nAs part of my responsibilities with newly charged youth in delinquency cases, I would advise the children of their rights to a lawyer and to remain silent. The police had done it and our Court Service Unit, similar to Maryland DJS, had done it.\nI would not just go though the routine questions about their right to a lawyer and right to remain silent, as I knew that many if not most did not or could not understand those words. They might be too young or they might not have done well enough in school to be able to understand the advisement of rights form that we prepared for them.\nSo I would ask the question and then, after a response or no response, would ask them what that meant to them. My best guess is that close to 90-95% of those youth did not understand their rights before they came to court and few even understood them after I talked with them.\nTheir concerns and fears about being charged and in court and the possibility of their being locked up were what they were thinking about and not the questions from me or our conversation.\nSo the General Assembly was reasonably concerned about the whole issue of advisement of rights. An additional concern should be about how the police advise them of their rights. If it is a pro-forma reading as they do with adults, in my view, that is meaningless. So having a video or audio (preferably video) of the advisement is critical for the judge to be able to watch. In addition, how the public defender, under the current law, advises them is also important. Unless the lawyer uses language and understands the age and developmental age of the children he or she are speaking with, what they tell the youth may not help much, if at all.\nWhile I have suggestions for some modifications to the law that I have shared with some of the members of the General Assembly, the most important suggestion would be to be sure that all of the police and lawyers who speak with or advise youth in these matters be trained on how to properly communicate with children.\nStephen Rideout is the mayor in Cambridge. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "House GOP introduces bill to repeal Biden college plan\n\n February 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MATHEW SCHUMER Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 549\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has advanced a Republican-sponsored bill that includes measures repealing key aspects of the Biden administration's plans to make college more affordable.The College Cost Reduction Act, introduced by the panel's chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-North Carolina), passed on a party-line 22-19 vote.\nThe measure presents numerous programs intended to strengthen the integrity of higher education institutions across the country, but also would gut much of President Joe Biden's efforts to help students afford college. Democrats on the committee offered a series of amendments to the bill aimed at blocking the GOP repeals, but all were defeated.\n\"Unfortunately, President Biden has decided time and time again that the executive branch should also hold the legislative pen,\" Foxx said, \"Congress has the task of creating laws that reflect the interests of the people. It is not the role of the executive pen.\"\nLast August, the Biden administration launched the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) program, aiming to cancel debt to borrowers who originally owed $12,000 or less in loans and had repaid at least ten years of those loans.\nThe program is slated to begin in February, with 6.9 million Americans already enrolled, according to the White House.\nBiden's original plan, as laid out in his 2022 executive order to cancel up to $430 billion in student loans, was blocked by the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision last June. The court determined that the secretary of education lacked the power to issue debt relief on the scale described in the administration's plan.\nLast September, Foxx introduced a resolution with Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Michigan, to nullify the SAVE plan, but the full House never voted on it.\nFoxx's College Cost Reduction Act, introduced in January, would establish a streamlined data system to convey information about colleges, create a performance-based grant program, and hold academic institutions responsible for unpaid student loans.\nIn the committee meeting to consider the bill, Democrats introduced 30 amendments to alter some fundamental aspects of the legislation.\nRep. Bobby Scott (D-Virginia) praised parts of Foxx's bill, \"such as codifying Postsecondary Student Success Grants and eliminating interest capitalization and origination fees on student loans,\" but the panel's ranking Democrat objected to some provisions that he said would make it harder for people to go to college.\nRep. Kathy Manning (D-Michigan) offered an amendment to strike language from the bill repealing Biden administration regulations to protect student borrowers during changes in ownership of academic institutions.\nAnother Biden administration regulation the Foxx bill aims to repeal is the 90-10 rule, which requires for-profit universities to secure at least 10 percent of their funding from non-federal sources. Rep. Mark Takano (D-California) introduced an amendment to strike this section from the final bill but was rebuffed by the GOP majority.\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) offered a motion to remove the bill's rescission of Biden's SAVE plan, but that motion was defeated.\n\"The new (SAVE) program created by the Biden administration… creates a generous IDR (income-driven repayment) plan that Republicans now want to strip away,\" Omar said.\nRep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Michigan) unsuccessfully tried to amend the bill with language streamlining the process of finding on-campus accommodations for students with disabilities.\nBonamici's proposal is part of a group of bills unveiled Monday by Democratic members of the education panel referred to collectively as the Roadmap to College Student Success. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What are you doing buddy? What's up pal?\" Jeff Simmons welcomes everyone with his energetic and contagious excitement.\nIt's 7:30 a.m. on a Tuesday morning. School won't begin for more than an hour. What brings middle schoolers, teachers and community members out early before school?\nFor some students in Queen Anne and Talbot Counties, it's a new club called Fellowship of Christian Athletes. This club, or huddle, welcomes not only athletes but anyone who wants to come and make a difference.\nAlthough FCA may be new to some local schools, it is well-known around the world. For over 60 years, FCA has had one mission — \"unite your two passions, faith and athletics, to impact the world for Jesus Christ.\"\nFounder Don McClanen started FCA after reading that 30 million American youth had no religious training. McClanen began posting his articles in the locker room and praying before games. Soon, he was dreaming of a way for well-known Christian athletes to advertise their faith on television and in magazines the way they advertised other household products. Currently, FCA is in 115 countries with over 20,000 huddle meetings occurring around the world.\nAt their first huddle, Centreville Middle students spent time together in fellowship.\nThe \"Walk Out Faith'' huddle activity included scripture readings, a memory verse and relevant questions asking teens how they can grow their faith while also building the community around them.\nSeventh Grade Social Studies teacher Thomas Hayman helps oversee the FCA huddle with other school staff. A former church youth director and a current Queen Anne's County Public Schools Teacher of the Year finalist, Hayman is dedicated to teaching and investing in his students. His loyalty doesn't go unnoticed, Hayman's students said he's told them he would even \"take a bullet\" to keep them safe.\nHayman said it was fate that allowed him to meet Simmons, a former CMS tutor, at the school and fate that put him in this position. Hayman said he is looking forward to the fellowship afforded by FCA \"to get together, have fun and see what kind of positive change we can make.\"\nSimmons is the area director of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes) for Queen Anne's and Talbot counties.\nHe said he had not heard of FCA until a friend suggested he look into it. After research and attending some huddle meetings, he said he was \"blown away by what they were doing, how they were doing it, and the impact it had.\nIn his new position, Simmons has to annually raise his entire budget. The success here is directly linked to the local community's involvement, Simmons said.\nWith all the huddles happening, there were still many middle and high schools in both Queen Anne's and Talbot counties that had no FCA presence and did not have the same opportunities.\nIn this monthly email update, Simmons wrote, \"There are 9 schools (middle and high) between both counties that do not have any sort of FCA on their campuses.\"\nWith the generous support of the community, the 2024 FCA budget for Queen Anne's and Talbot counties was fully funded.\n\"Thanks to God's provision, coming in the form of generous one time donations and support from those who signed on as Monthly Partners, we reached the amount needed to support the program's budget for 2024\" Simmons said.\n\"In order to establish FCA programming in the remaining schools, we need to fully fund our FCA budget with recurring donations,\" Simmons shared. \"Securing our annual budget with recurring monthly support will allow us to start planning for the future of FCA on the Eastern Shore. This will allow us to not only provide resources and support to the huddles that are already up and running, but also to establish a FCA presence in the schools without one currently.\"\n\"Your support, whether it be in financial contributions, prayer and encouragement,\" Simmons continued, \"has confirmed this community's commitment to see Jesus glorified and lives changed through this ministry, and I am so grateful that we all get to be a part of it. God is working on the Shore through these coaches, students, and leaders and I know that the best is yet to come!\"\nIf you would like more information or would like to volunteer, email Jeff Simmons at jsimmons@fca.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This is a nearly $7.9 million increase from fiscal year 2024.\nTCPS Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said that while this seems like a larger increase than recent years, the increase is meant to offset a decrease in federal funding.\n\"This unrestricted budget coupled with the decrease in all of our federal programs nets to a 3.4% increase,\" she said.\nThis means that the district is asking for a total of 3.4% more money than it received for fiscal year 2024.\nTCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the district is losing $4.8 million in grant funding for fiscal year 2025.\nTCPS Director of Communications Debbie Gardner said in an interview that the $4.8 million came from two COVID-19 related grants — the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund and the Maryland Leads grant.\nThe proposed capital budget for fiscal year 2025 is $12.1 million. Capital requests include the renovation and expansion of Chapel District Elementary School, the installation of a turf field at Easton High School, the replacement of auditorium lights at Easton High School, the installation of a basketball court at Easton Elementary School, an update to the stadium lighting at Easton High School and a playground replacement at St. Michaels Elementary School.\nNext month, the proposed budget will be presented to the County Council. A public budget hearing, held by the County Council, is set for May.\nBoard President Emily Jackson thanked TCPS staff for \"the huge lift\" of preparing the budget.\n\"Go forth and get this passed,\" she said. \"You can do it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, she said the interim standard will also remain in effect until July 1, 2025.\nThe interim standard states that students can be considered college and career ready if they achieve certain scores on either the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, the early fall MCAP or the spring MCAP for both English 10 and either Algebra I, Algebra II or Geometry.\nAnother update Einhorn gave at the meeting is that the district has hired Sharon Gaskins as a strategic facilitator to support the district's efforts with the Blueprint.\n\"(Gaskins) has over 25 years in education and really has been a change agent working with organizations to ensure that they meet their goals,\" Einhorn said.\nEinhorn said the district was able hire Gaskins using grant funding through the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board.\nEinhorn also gave an update on a report that the district will need to submit to the Accountability and Implementation Board and MSDE by March 15.\nThe report will detail the district's implementation of the Blueprint so far. Einhorn said this includes discussing any challenges the district might be facing with implementation.\nThis report is a way for the state to monitor that school districts are \"able to transform\" through reshaping and adapting new polices and practices that create a more equitable system, Einhorn said.\n\"I'm here tonight to assure you that we will meet that March 15 deadline,\" she said. \"And I look forward to sharing some of the findings in that report.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Corporate tax breaks end up costing schools\n\n February 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: THE CONVERSATION | Section: National \n \n 1063\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Built in 1910, James Elementary is a three-story brick school in Kansas City, Missouri's historic Northeast neighborhood, with a bright blue front door framed by a sand-colored stone arch adorned with a gargoyle.As bustling students and teachers negotiate a maze of gray stairs with worn wooden handrails, Marjorie Mayes, the school's principal, escorts a visitor across uneven blue tile floors on the ground floor to a classroom with exposed brick walls and pipes. Bubbling paint mars some walls, evidence of the water leaks spreading inside the aging building.\n\"It's living history,\" said Mayes during a mid-September tour of the building. \"Not the kind of living history we want.\"\nThe district would like to tackle the $400 million in deferred maintenance needed to create a 21st century learning environment at its 35 schools — including James Elementary — but it can't. It doesn't have the money.\nPROPERTY TAX REDIRECT\nThe lack of funds is a direct result of the property tax breaks that Kansas City lavishes on companies and developers that do business there. The program is supposed to bring in new jobs and business but instead has ended up draining civic coffers and starving schools. Between 2017 and 2023, the Kansas City school district lost $237.3 million through tax abatements.\nKansas City is hardly an anomaly. An estimated 95% of U.S. cities provide economic development tax incentives to woo corporate investors. The upshot is that billions have been diverted from large urban school districts and from a growing number of small suburban and rural districts. The impact is seen in districts as diverse as Chicago and Cleveland, Hillsboro, Oregon, and Storey County, Nevada.\nThe result? A 2021 review of 2,498 financial statements from school districts across 27 states revealed that, in 2019 alone, at least $2.4 billion was diverted to fund tax incentives. Yet that substantial figure still downplays the magnitude of the problem, because three-quarters of the 10,370 districts analyzed did not provide any information on tax abatement agreements.\nTax abatement programs have long been controversial, pitting states and communities against one another in beggar-thy-neighbor contests. Their economic value is also, at best, unclear: Studies show most companies would have made the same location decision without taxpayer subsidies. Meanwhile, schools make up the largest cost item in these communities, meaning they suffer most when companies are granted breaks in property taxes.\nA three-month investigation by The Conversation and three scholars with expertise in economic development, tax laws and education policy shows that the cash drain from these programs is not equally shared by schools in the same communities. At the local level, tax abatements and exemptions often come at the cost of critical funding for school districts that students from low-income households and who are racial minorities.\nIn Missouri, for example, in 2022 nearly $1,700 per student was redirected from Kansas City public and charter schools, while between $500 and $900 was redirected from wealthier, whiter Northland schools on the north side of the river in Kansas City and in the suburbs beyond. Other studies have found similar demographic trends elsewhere, including New York state, South Carolina and Columbus, Ohio.\nThe funding gaps produced by abated money often force schools to delay needed maintenance, increase class sizes, lay off teachers and support staff and even close outright. Schools also struggle to update or replace outdated technology, books and other educational resources. And, amid a nationwide teacher shortage, schools under financial pressures sometimes turn to inexperienced teachers who are not fully certified or rely too heavily on recruits from overseas who have been given special visa status.\nLost funding also prevents teachers and staff, who often feed, clothe and otherwise go above and beyond to help students in need, from earning a living wage. All told, tax abatements can end up harming a community's value, with constant funding shortfalls creating a cycle of decline.\nINCENTIVES AND PAYOFFS\nPerversely, some of the largest beneficiaries of tax abatements are the politicians who publicly boast of handing out the breaks despite the harm to poorer communities. Incumbent governors have used the incentives as a means of taking credit for job creation, even when the jobs were coming anyway.\n\"We know that subsidies don't work,\" said Elizabeth Marcello, a doctoral lecturer at Hunter College who studies governmental planning and policy and the interactions between state and local governments. \"But they are good political stories, and I think that's why politicians love them so much.\"\nWhile some voters may celebrate abatements, parents can recognize the disparities between school districts that are created by the tax breaks. Fairleigh Jackson pointed out that her daughter's East Baton Rouge third grade class lacks access to playground equipment.\nThe class is attending school in a temporary building while their elementary school undergoes a two-year renovation.\nThe temporary site has some grass and a cement slab where kids can play, but no playground equipment, Jackson said. And parents needed to set up an Amazon wish list to purchase basic equipment such as balls, jump ropes and chalk for students to use. The district told parents there would be no playground equipment due to a lack of funds, then promised to install equipment, Jackson said, but months later, there is none.\nJackson said it's hard to complain when other schools in the district don't even have needed security measures in place. \"When I think about playground equipment, I think that's a necessary piece of child development,\" Jackson said. \"Do we even advocate for something that should be a daily part of our kids' experience when kids' safety isn't being funded?\"\nA young student in the East Baton Rouge district told the school board that money going to tax breaks for corporations could provide better internet access or be used to hire someone to pick up the glass and barbed wire in the playground. But at least they have a playground — Hayden Crockett, a seventh grader at Sherwood Middle Academic Magnet School, noted that his sister's elementary school lacked one.\n\"If it wasn't in the budget to fund playground equipment, how can it also be in the budget to give one of the most powerful corporations in the world a tax break?\" Crockett said. \"The math just ain't mathing.\"\nThis article was written by Christine Wen, Texas A&M University; Danielle McLean, The Conversation; Kevin Welner, University of Colorado Boulder; and Nathan Jensen, The University of Texas at Austin.

I think that's important,\" said Shira Goodman, senior director of advocacy for the Anti-Defamation League, which has seen a rise in reports of antisemitism since Oct. 7.\nGoodman said protests and events on campus can potentially run afoul of Title VI of the federal Civil Rights Act that protects students and others of \"shared ancestry\" and other protected classes from mistreatment and harassment at colleges and universities receiving federal financial aid and other government money.\nThe U.S. Department of Education is currently conducting Title VI shared ancestry investigations at more than 40 colleges — including Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, University of Michigan, Montana State University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of South Florida and University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nOn the other side of the issue, Haley Gluhanich, program officer for campus rights advocacy for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, has seen an increase in calls from students and others across the political spectrum about their First Amendment rights being restricted.\n\"We are seeing events being canceled. We are seeing student organizations being de-chartered. We are seeing students and faculty members getting disciplined for social media posts for some comments made in class,\" Gluhanich said.\nProtests against the war include criticism of U.S. and President Joe Biden's military and other support for Israel.\nGluhanich and Jane Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota, said even \"hate speech\" enjoys First Amendment and protections as long as it doesn't cross the line into more direct and specific threats or incites violence.\nKirtley worries about government actors (including at public universities) as well as wealthy donors discouraging speech they don't like.\nShe said that comes with peril and potential blowback.\n\"Once we open the door to allowing the government to tell us what thoughts aren't acceptable, we run the risk that, in the future, ideas with which we agree could be suppressed, as well,\" she said.\nFor a more expansive story on this issue check out StarDem.com and our e-edition on Monday, Feb. 26. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Winter break will begin Dec. 20.\nThe calendar committee emailed a link to the survey Jan. 12 to over 5,400 parents, guardians and all CCPS staff members. A reminder email was sent Jan. 22, and the survey was closed Jan. 26. Some community members provided feedback, as well.\nAlthough 75% of the 3,500 parents and guardians who responded favored a post-Labor Day start, 696 staff respondents, or 70% preferred a pre-Labor Day start.\nBefore reviewing the feedback, Simmons cautioned the school board, saying, \"No matter what decision you make, you're going to make people upset, period. There is no perfect calendar, period.\"\nBoard member and retired Caroline County teacher Donna DiGiacomo favored the earlier start.\n\"So, one calendar starts Aug 28; the other starts Sept. 3, but the end date is just one day difference,\" DiGiacomo said. The adopted calendar gets \"students in a routine quicker, and you have a shorter week when you start — you have three days, so everybody's not dead by Friday.\"\nShe said a 4-day first day of school \"doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a lot.\"\nWinter break begins with a half-day Friday, Dec. 20, and students returning to school Jan. 7.\n\"A hard shutdown over winter break for two solid weeks\" would result in reduced heating costs and \"significant savings\" during \"the hardest budget year we're going to have,\" Simmons said.\nThe post-Labor Day calendar would have had students returning Thursday, Jan. 2, 2025.\n\"This might not be a popular thing to say, but the reality is not a whole lot is going to get done on that Thursday and Friday,\" DiGiacomo said.\nOther factors influencing the pre-Labor Day start were academic quarter dates and required parent-teacher conferences, which \"we talked about ad nauseum,\" Simmons said.\nCalling the process \"wonky\" and comparing it to a game of dominoes, Simmons explained the factors that prompted the calendar committee to go through \"seven or eight drafts to get down to the two that made the most sense.\"\nFor example, the first quarter parent-teacher conference day will occur Nov. 5, even though it's election day, because the first quarter ends Nov. 8 and the conference day \"has to fall before the first report card goes out, before grades are secured,\" Simmons said.\nThe adopted calendar has four inclement weather days built in. If they are not used, they come off the calendar.\nState law, teacher contracts, mandatory conferences, state testing days, a set number of half-days, a mid-year transition day all dictate certain days off. Once all of the days off are built in, \"it becomes a game of counting to 90 twice\" to achieve a state-mandated 180-day school year, Simmons said.\nDiGiacomo recommended surveying students next year and considering staggered starts for sixth grade and ninth grade students as they change schools.\n\"The pluses of draft two are just not as many as the pluses in draft one,\" said Rick Barton, president of the school board.\nAlthough he liked \"the idea of a longer break,\" school board Vice President Mark Jones was ambivalent.\n\"I honestly don't like either one of them, really,\" he said.\nThat ambivalence was reflected in the overall survey results, with 54% of all respondents preferring a post-Labor Day start and 46% going with the pre-Labor Day calendar.\nAnticipating mixed reactions from the public and staff as well, Jones asked, \"When do we want to hear complaints? Do we want to hear them right before the first day of school, or do we want to hear them after Christmas break? I think I'd probably rather hear them at the beginning of the year and get it out of the way.\"\nTo view the 2024-2025 CCPS school year calendar, visit www.carolineschools.org/page/ccps-school-calendar.

A week later, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, the Board announced that Bromwell would be stepping down from his position, effective March 1.\nBromwell was officially appointed as superintendent in 2020 with a four year term. Before that, he served as interim superintendent for the district. In his time at DCPS, he has also served as a teacher in the district and as the principal of Cambridge-South Dorchester High School.\nAccording to the Feb. 21 statement from the Board of Education, the decision for Bromwell to step down in March was \"mutually decided\" by him and the Board. In the Feb. 16 statement, the Board expressed gratitude to Bromwell for his years of service to DCPS.\nValerie Goff, DCPS communication and community outreach specialist, said Bromwell, who was not present at the Board meeting Thursday, had no comments at this time.\nAt the meeting, Board Vice President Susan Morgan acknowledged that the district is experiencing change \"once again.\"\n\"But I do trust in our teachers, our administrators, our directors and, now, our interim superintendent, to keep us moving forward,\" she said. \"Through everything we as a Board do, we always keep in the front of our minds what's best for all the children that we serve.\"\nBoard Member Chris Wheedleton said the search for the district's next leader can't happen without \"recognizing the value of somebody who has given close to 40 years of service to the district.\"\n\"I want to thank Mr. Bromwell for his service and for what he has done,\" Wheedleton said.\nEarlier in the meeting, Milton Nagel and Bill Middleton from the Maryland Association of Boards of Education presented on what to keep in mind when conducting a superintendent search.\nNagel told the Board that although it was not their reason for attending the meeting, MABE does conduct superintendent searches for its member districts.\n\"If the Board so desires to engage in that conversation about potentially having MABE do a search, we can certainly facilitate that,\" he said.\nIn a statement released later that night, the Board said it will begin the search for a new superintendent to take office July 1.\nToward the end of his remarks at the meeting Thursday, Thompson, who is also a board member of the Talbot County Board of Education, told the public that they will get mad at him.\n\"But I want you to also understand this — and I mean this from the bottom of my heart — that I'm always going to make the best decisions that I think are right for kids,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We are a family childcare home, not a center.\"\nThey opened just last summer. But over the years, Elizabeth has taught in a variety of childcare centers, in public and private schools, and at the university level.\n\"It was important to us to develop a program that included neurodivergent children and was based on best practice and research-informed play-based learning,\" she said. \"We recognized that the most impact on learning happens in early childhood and sought to develop a program that combined community resources, learning experiences outside the classroom, and sensory-rich play.\"\nA neuro-affirming, play-based, bilingual family child care located in Betterton, they are an MSDE-approved ASPIRE Pre-K and participate in the MD EXCELS and credentialing programs. With an extensive background in special education, their passion is providing quality care to diverse learners and serving families in their community.\nBeyond the home, Kinder Connection participates in many field trips for not just the children but for the whole family.\n\"Since we have been open, we have taken children to Tuckahoe State Park hiking, the Delaware Children's Museum, the Garfield theater twice, the Galena Fire Department, the Sultana Foundation twice, Bespoke Chocolate, Talbot County Ice Rink to go ice skating, to a magic show, to library concerts and events, and to almost every park in the area,\" Elizabeth said.\nFamilies pay a set field trip/holiday fee each week, and Kinder Connection coordinates everything. They also have had a variety of guest speakers come and talk to the children.\nIn less than a year, Kinder Connection is already making plans to expand.\n\"We are planning to expand our home by adding almost 600 square feet,\" Elizabeth said. \"This will allow us the already licensed Kinder Connection to convert to a designated Large Family Childcare and separate the two classrooms from their home. The facility is currently licensed for eight children, and the addition will allow them to serve 12 children. The next step is finding funding for the addition and a large van or small bus so that will make weekly field trips easier.\"\nWith a current waiting list for future spots, children are accepted through the ASPIRE program, which provides grant funding through MSDE for free tuition for qualifying families of children ages 3 to 5. Kinder Connection also accepts Child Care Scholarships for low-income working families.\n\"We strive to have our program look like our community — we value having a variety of cultures, races, abilities, and socio-economic status represented,\" Elizabeth said.\nIn addition to school-year care, Kinder Connection runs a summer camp as well. \"We run a 6-week summer camp where we enjoy immersing ourselves in art, music, and water play and take several field trips,\" she said.\nParents William Machande and Sarah Kalb said, \"Kinder Connection has been truly extraordinary for our son's growth and development. We are so fortunate to have found Ellie and Jamie. They provide a comfortable, fun and productive environment for the children. They go above and beyond, and then some.\"\n\"I love that my three year old learns beyond the four walls of a room and spends a lot of time outside, learning in exciting and innovative ways. He's always excited to share his day,\" said Robert and Dana Smith. \"Both Ellie and Jamie have included the families on fun field trips and in holiday fun. The Christmas program was such a highlight.\"\nFor more information, visit kinderconnection.org/. There is an upcoming open house for families of children ages 1 to 5 that are interested in fall care at 6 p.m. Monday, March 11. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Teaching & Transformation: Semester in the Chesapeake Classroom'\n\n March 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 495\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Washington College's Center for Environment and Society (CES) announces the grand opening of MuSE: A Community Museum, in downtown Chestertown. The space, located at 210 S. Cross Street, will host a number of rotating exhibits highlighting Washington College teaching, experiential learning, and research with opportunities for sharing, learning, and dialogue in a community space.Each exhibit will be informational, interactive, and highly visual, creating a dynamic space for learning and sharing for the Eastern Shore community.\n\"Facilitating shared knowledge and understanding to drive action for conservation and community resilience is at the core of our mission,\" said Valerie Imbruce, director of Washington College's Center for Environment and Society. \"This new off-campus space will aid us in creating opportunities for active collaboration for both teaching and learning for our Washington College community, community organizations, regional K-12 educators, students, and interested visitors. We're excited to welcome the community into this new, innovative, and collaborative space.\"\nLast fall, the Digital Scholarship in Museum Partnerships Project was the first collaborative effort featured in the Cross Street space, which hosted a collection of exhibits created by students from five museums in Kent County — Sumner Hall, The Waterman's Museum, The Worton Point Schoolhouse, Betterton Heritage Museum, and Kent Museum. With the goal of preserving and providing greater access to the local histories of our community, the exhibition highlighted the mission of the space by providing digitized looks into each museum, viewable through virtual reality with 360-degree virtual tours, digitized collections, oral history interviews, and interactive panels.\nOpening on March 1, the first exhibit in the new, updated, and enhanced space will be \"Teaching & Transformation: Semester in the Chesapeake Classroom.\" It will showcase the nature and culture of the Chesapeake Bay region through the final projects created by Washington College's Chesapeake Semester students. Their hand-drawn maps, visual journals, and other writing and visual arts will provide visitors a sense of the unique Chesapeake ecosystem, analyze solutions to environmental problems, and explore the nexus between science, policy, and people's everyday lives in the region.\n\"The Chesapeake Semester is such a unique opportunity afforded to Washington College by our location here on the historically, culturally, and ecologically rich Eastern Shore,\" said Sara Clarke-De Reza, education department chair and director of the museum, field, and community education minor. \"This exhibit showcases our students' intensive interdisciplinary study of the Chesapeake Bay, and their comparative study in watershed communities in northern Belize. The students' hope for this exhibit is that it will highlight the lessons learned through classroom and field-based experiences across the semester in a way that expands visitors' understanding of the human and social dimensions of environmental issues in our region.\"\nWhen exhibits are installed, MuSE will be open on First Fridays from 4:30-7 p.m. and on Saturdays from 8 a.m. to noon during the Chestertown Farmers Market. Requests for group showings will also be available. \"Teaching & Transformation: Semester in the Chesapeake Classroom\" will remain open through August 2024.

    "content": "Chesapeake College's Hispanic/Latino Student Union provides community, support\n\n March 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 620\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Zulema Delacruz Martinez was a second-year student at Chesapeake College when LaSella Hall, director of diversity, equity and inclusion for Chesapeake College, approached her about starting a student-led union for the school's Latino community.Together, they started the Hispanic/Latino Student Union and have assisted in retention for the growing Latino student population at Chesapeake College.\nThe Hispanic/Latino Student Union hosted a night in late February to assist community members who were having trouble filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, commonly called FAFSA.\nThis form assists current and prospective college students to determine their eligibility for student financial aid.\nDelacruz Martinez said that more than 90 percent of attendees applied for Chesapeake College. She assisted families from all age groups, including grandparents with limited knowledge of the internet.\nFor many first-generation immigrant families, there is a caution with filling out FAFSA, especially if the student's parents are undocumented, Delacruz Martinez said.\nAccording to the federal student aid website, a parent's or spouse's citizenship status doesn't affect a student's ability to complete the FAFSA form.\nDelacruz Martinez said she hopes to spread the message that higher education is reachable for immigrant families.\n\"I want to serve my community,\" Delacruz Martinez said. \"I want to make sure that students and families are being taken care of and that they have the resources to know what to do. Because I went through that, I didn't have anyone to do that for me, and I was terrified. I was like, 'OK, let me make sure people don't go through that the same way I did.'\"\nLaSella Hall said he believes in the power of what student-led projects can do. He even developed his own method based on it.\nThe \"Hall Method\" focuses on empowering students, believing in their potential and guiding them toward success rather than just telling them what they can't do.\nHall said that if people don't understand where students are coming from or what they are going through, then telling them to succeed means nothing.\nHe recalls working with students in Atlanta who had parents addicted to drugs or students who had their lights turned off for three days. Hall said asking students to succeed academically was unreasonable when they had more significant issues they were worried about.\nThe Hall Method emphasizes having hard conversations, advocating for student voices at decision-making tables and leaving leadership of specific communities and cultures to members of those communities. Because of this method, Hall pushed hard to create the Hispanic/Latino Student Union.\n\"Student organizations really should be about advocacy and advancing the voice of those students,\" Hall said. \"It should be about tackling really important issues that the students feel passionate about.\"\nDelacruz Martinez notes that leading the Cinco de Mayo event made her work feel real and impactful to her school. Hall approached Delacruz Martinez when their organization was new, and all members were incredibly busy with school.\nThey met with members who didn't think they should do anything for the holiday because they didn't have the time, but Hall pushed Delacruz Martinez and other leaders to figure something out.\nDelacruz Martinez got to work. She made phone calls, did research and was able to take 10 students in a rented van to celebrate Cinco de Mayo at a local Hispanic restaurant. It made Delacruz Martinez feel accomplished.\nShe said she wants to run her own nonprofit and, more than anything, positively impact her community.\n\"I think coming from a minority community and coming from a single-parent household, there's a lot of challenges,\" Delacruz Martinez said. \"There were a lot of things I did not know, but the same with my community. I don't know if it's just resilience. I don't know if I'm just stubborn. But I think it's when you give us the opportunities, we'll take them on.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Peter and Paul High School.The team's project was a plan for a Salisbury Riverfront Community Center and included site logistics, design, cost estimates and timelines to pitch their vision for a center on the Wicomico River.\n\"The judges were blown away by the projects,\" Judge James Cook said. \"The industry is alive and well given what we have seen tonight.\"\nWhat the judges saw were project proposals by four teams. In addition to the Wicomico County team, Easton, Sts. Peter and Paul, and St. Michaels high schools competed for the gold cup and scholarships.\nThis was the 20th annual competition for ACE Mentors, a group of professionals representing the architecture, construction and engineering industries.\nEach team took the stage and pitched the case for their projects with slideshows.\nThe winning Wicomico project included landscape architecture and community art. The team presented the codes they would have to satisfy to create their building.\nAndrea Suk, Wicomico county coordinator, was thrilled with her students' win.\n\"We have 15 full time students,\" she said. \"These students are very interested in either architecture, construction or engineering.\"\nThe team worked with professional mentors in each of the ACE fields, mentors who volunteered their time to work with students.\n\"They give up their time to go into the schools and teach students about each of those fields and how they work together to create all the wonderful buildings and structures around us,\" Suk said.\nThe event was sponsored in part by the late Charles H. Thornton, a renowned structural engineer, educator and mentor who died in December. There were 26 other sponsors at different levels. The named scholarships were Easton Utilities, DBF/ACE Gerald Friedel Legacy, Lane Engineering, Griffith Family and CT Darnell Construction.\nThe platinum sponsors were the Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. and Willow Construction.\nThe St. Michaels High School project proposed a harbor floodgate to address global warming and the resulting flooding in town. The students proposed building a concrete wall with a 40-foot gate to let boats pass. The wall would go across the mouth of the harbor facing the Miles River.\nEaston High students proposed a tourist-friendly oyster hatchery called Project Clarity in Easton Point Park. Part of their plan was to bring oysters back to that part of Easton Point.\nThe last project, presented by the Sts. Peter and Paul team, proposed building a castle in Wye Mills near the intersection of U.S. Route 50 and state Route 404. The castle would host jousting and mixed martial arts programming. The colossal structure was estimated to cost more than $80 million to build.\n\"Our project is 'The Castle,'\" said Peter Anderson, a senior at Saints Peter and Paul. \"I really wanted to push the boundaries of ACE and break the mold and push the boundaries. I thought a castle would be big, bold and abrasive.\"\nThe presentations were reviewed by three judges — James Cook, vice president and project manager at Rauch; Aaron Goller, a civil engineer at Easton Utilities; and Rick VanEmburgh, engineer for the Town of Easton.\nLocal engineer Sean Callahan is the president of Lane Engineering and a mentor in the ACE program.\n\"ACE mentors does a tremendous job of bringing young folk up and showing them the ropes,\" Callahan said. \"It is great to see young folks get excited, and that is a part of what this is.\"\nAnother mentor working with students is Rebecca Saduk, a civil engineer for Easton Utilities.\n\"I wish I had had a program like ACE, and that is why I am so passionate about being a mentor,\" she said. \"These kids are learning real life work habits and how to work as a team.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "No one knows how to pay for Maryland's massive education reform\n\n March 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CAPITAL NEWS SERVICE | Section: State News \n \n 1537\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Maryland's Democratic-led legislature passed the Blueprint for Maryland's Future in 2021, vowing to pour billions of dollars into the state's public schools to offer universal pre-K, improve teaching and make sure students are ready for college or careers.But the General Assembly didn't outline a long-term plan to fund the ambitious 10-year education reform effort — which increasingly looks like a blueprint for red ink.\nThe Local News Network at the University of Maryland found that the Blueprint is already devouring hundreds of millions annually from the state's fund balance, which is on target to be fully drained in 2027.\nAnd according to a state Department of Legislative Services fiscal briefing released in January, the state will start running a structural deficit in fiscal year 2025 that will multiply nearly sixfold by fiscal year 2029, when it will hit $2.93 billion. Not coincidentally, that fiscal briefing estimates implementing the Blueprint will cost more than $4 billion in 2029.\nThe General Assembly's plan for dealing with the cost crunch? There isn't one — at least not yet. Neither Gov. Wes Moore in his State of the State address nor any of the Democratic state legislators interviewed for this story have offered any potential solutions for the coming Blueprint cash crunch.\n\"Several years from now we're going to have to have a much more direct conversation about the long-term costs,\" said state Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat from Baltimore City. \"But we're not there yet.\"\nRepublicans, meanwhile, see the Blueprint as a budget-breaker.\n\"We cannot pay these billions and billions of dollars in extra monies — not just state but local as well,\" said House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany). \"We can't pay for them unless you're going to talk about new taxes — and significant taxes.\"\nThe Blueprint's background\nIn 2016, then-Gov. Larry Hogan and the General Assembly created the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education to assess the public education system in Maryland and determine whether current funding schemes were conducive to student success.\nHeaded by William Kirwan, the former chancellor of the University System of Maryland, the commission came to the conclusion that an overhaul was needed.\n\"One of the 'aha' moments of the commission was really to face the fact that in Maryland, on what we call the Nation's Report Card, Maryland's score was about in the middle … and moving in the wrong direction,\" said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board, a state entity that's making sure school districts adhere to the plan.\nBut Hogan had an \"aha\" moment of his own after Democrats crafted the Kirwan Commission's report into comprehensive legislation. In 2019, Hogan criticized the pending reform proposal, telling a group of county officials it would mean \"billions and billions more in mandated spending increases for county and state taxpayers,\" according to The Frederick News-Post.\nHogan vetoed the bill creating the Blueprint in May 2020, saying he did not want to raise taxes amid the COVID-19 pandemic to fund the education plan. The General Assembly overrode his veto in 2021.\nAnd the following year, voters elected a strong backer of the Blueprint — Democrat Wes Moore — to succeed Hogan, who is now running for a U.S. Senate seat.\nOn the first day of the current legislative session that began in January, Moore said he believes in the reform plan and he will work with the General Assembly to ensure the Blueprint is implemented properly and sustainably.\n\"I believe in the premise and the promise of the Blueprint. I think we need a world-class education system in the state of Maryland,\" Moore said. \"I think that's going to be a prerequisite for us to be able to accomplish the economic goal that we're hoping for.\"\nLofty goals\nIn the state's 24 public school districts, the Blueprint and its lofty goals are already beginning to take shape.\nEach school district has already drawn up a preliminary plan for how it will meet targets for offering pre-K, increasing teacher salaries and improving student performance. The Accountability and Implementation Board has approved all those plans after first asking for revisions.\nThe Blueprint is meant to revamp the state's education system by presenting the same opportunities for all students. With a law like the Blueprint, one size has to fit all to achieve its goals of maximizing reading and math skills, as well as increasing pathways into college, said Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George's and Anne Arundel).\n\"So we want that for every kid across the state. We don't want variation of those goals,\" Rosapepe said. \"Now, the details of how stuff is paid for — I mean, I think that's a conversation that will be ongoing.\"\nCheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, said the teachers union is fully behind the Blueprint.\n\"We have a shared understanding that our goal is for students to succeed academically and become valuable citizens in our state and in our country,\" Bost said. \"In order to do that, we have to make an investment in public education. I think for the most part, the Blueprint identifies where that money has to go.\"\nWhat it doesn't do, however, is identify where the money will come from. Bost, whose union represents 74,000 educators in the state, acknowledged the concerns about the Blueprint's cost. But she indicated the increased spending on education is both needed and long overdue.\n\"We constitutionally have to provide a public education for all students, so the investment is needed,\" Bost said. \"And when some people balk at, 'Oh, it's all this money' — well, we've been starving public education for many years.\"\nThe budget dilemma\nThe Blueprint remains fully funded in Moore's latest fiscal year 2025 budget proposal, leaving many lawmakers to turn their attention to other legislative issues this year. Ferguson, the Senate president, said in terms of current Blueprint funding, \"we're more than fine.\"\nBut that's not so in the long term. The cost of implementing the Blueprint is projected to grow from $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $4.1 billion five years later, according to the Department of Legislative Services.\nMeanwhile, the state's structural budget gap is set to balloon every year through 2029 — when Legislative Services expects it to be $2.9 billion and the Moore administration says it will be about $3.5 billion.\nClosing that budget gap will be immensely difficult, said Christopher Summers, president and CEO of the conservative Maryland Policy Institute, who also said the Blueprint should be paused.\n\"Raising taxes (is) not going to solve this problem, and I think the governor knows that,\" said Summers, who has been critical of the Blueprint for years.\nThe Blueprint calls on school districts to increase education funding too, thereby prompting Summers to say that county budgets face the biggest fiscal threat.\nBut in Annapolis, lawmakers from both parties acknowledged that the General Assembly will have to make some tough decisions in the years to come as the Blueprint's bills come due.\n\"I think we know the reality that we're facing. And I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion about that,\" said State Sen. Guy J. Guzzone, a Democrat from Howard County. \"I just don't know that there's an immediate answer.\"\nOne obvious solution would be raising taxes to cover the state's coming shortfalls. But Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey, a Republican from the Eastern Shore, said a solution lies in cutting back the demands of the Blueprint rather than paying for the sweeping overhaul as it stands.\n\"Republicans have stated very often that we need to move to a 'Blueprint lite' or you know, some type of education reform that takes some of the important components of the Blueprint, but at the same time is affordable and allows counties to make decisions on which parts of the Blueprint are more meaningful in each of their public school systems,\" Hershey said.\nDemocrats, however, back the current Blueprint, despite its cost. Del. Ben Barnes, a Democrat who chairs the Appropriations Committee, said legislators should start talking about a long-term payment plan for the Blueprint now. The shared values between the legislature and the governor will bring them together, Barnes said, to solve the Blueprint budget dilemma.\n\"This legislature, the governor, we share values, and those shared values include all the priorities of the Blueprint,\" Barnes said. \"Getting to children who live in communities of poverty, taking care of special needs students, I mean, these are what we all ran on. And so I feel confident we'll find the revenue we need to support that program.\"\nSeveral state officials have said they are looking to the Accountability and Implementation Board to issue recommendations regarding the Blueprint's budget challenges. The board has made policy proposals included in bills that, if passed this legislative session, would make adjustments to the law without changing the finances.\nIn addition, the board is set to release additional recommendations this legislative session.\n\"What the AIB has tried to sort of suggest is like, let's try to implement it the way it's intended. And if it doesn't work, if it's just no longer the right thing to do, then we need to change it,\" said Hise, the board's executive director. \"But for many things, we haven't gotten to that point yet.\"\nCapital News Service reporters Kiersten Hacker, Christina Walker and Ela Jalil wrote this article.\nCapital News Service reporters Kiersten Hacker, Christina Walker and Ela Jalil wrote this article. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Herzog Foundation.The Herzog Foundation is a national organization dedicated to \"advancing Christian education.\" The foundation enriches Christian (K-12) education by creating and leading various programs.\nOne of these programs was the 2023 Bill of Rights Essay Contest. All middle and high school students enrolled in a Christian school or those homeschooled in the U.S. were eligible to participate. Winners were selected from one middle school and one high school. Each winner would go on to receive $250 from the Herzog Foundation. The winners' schools also received an additional $250.\nParticipants were asked to answer these questions in three pages or less, \"What made the Bill of Rights so revolutionary and unique when it was ratified? How has the Bill of Rights shaped our country?\"\nIn an excerpt from Viana's eloquently crafted three-page essay, the middle school winner wrote, \"The Bill of Rights is famous for that little, life-changing word: freedom, but what most people don't realize is that these documents weren't written overnight. Real people struggled, wrestled, and mulled over each word and phrase that went into the Bill of Rights, until it was finally ratified on December 15, 1791. Not only was it composed through much time and consideration but it secured the rights of people today granting our blessed country to grow, expand, and enter new times of innovation. It summarized what we stood for then and stand for now. It lets a person breathe, work, and earn their way to success.\"\nThe Herzog Foundation announced Viana, daughter of George and Cathy Johnston, as the middle school winner of the contest in December. Johnston received the prize money and a trophy for her achievement.\nIn a release announcing the winners, Herzog Foundation Chairman Todd Graves said, \"The Bill of Rights was ratified over 230 years ago and still stands as a beacon for our most fundamental rights as Americans. It's crucial that all young students understand the significance of this founding document.\"\nKathy Guerra, head of Lighthouse Christian Academy, stated the school was initially in disbelief, as this was the first time their school had made an entry to a contest of this magnitude. However, they were not surprised that Viana had won, as she is a gifted writer who creates masterworks of art with her words. \"Viana is an inquisitive, energetic, and ambitious student,\" says Guerra, who \"seeks to excel in all of her subjects.\"\nTo learn more about the Herzog Foundation and the programs it has to offer, visit www.herzog foundation.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Target team will not see expansion this season\n\n March 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 569\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — Shawn Connolly, head coach for the Kent Island Clay Target Team, presented updates and hopes for expansion to the Queen Anne's Board of Education during their regular meeting March 6.Connolly celebrated the the team, who was featured in the fall issue of PullUSA Magazine.\nSeveral of the students, along with Connolly, were interviewed for the national publication that is distributed to 36,000 students around the country in 37 states, he said. The Kent Island team is recognized as being the first public school in Maryland to join the USA High School Clay Target League.\n\"It was very cool to see ourselves in the spotlight,\" he said.\nConnolly appeared before the board this month to seek approval to expand the team's student limit to accommodate growing interest in the sport.\nSchool team limits are typically based on funding, transportation, or the nature of the sport, none of which are applicable in the target team's case, noted Connolly.\nThe team is self funded and participates at a private facility with all transportation, sponsorship and insurance covered, he said.\n\"I'm just trying to provide this sport to as many as I can,\" he added.\nConnolly noted the official league rules mandate a ratio of 10 students to one coach, and he has personally mandated even more strict requirements, with one coach for every squad of five students.\nNow the team currently has six all-volunteer coaches, \"And we have many more that would be willing to help out, and there are always parents,\" he said.\nAll students are welcome to the target team no matter their athletic ability; it allows students to wear a uniform and be a part of team who might not otherwise, Connolly said.\n\"One of the beauties of this league is that everybody participates,\" without tryouts and slots available only for the most skilled students, he said. However, students must pass a safety program and register before they participate.\nLast year the team turned away about five students due to capacity, he said.\nAs team capacity falls under the superintendent's authority, the board turned to Superintendent Patricia Saelens, who noted Queen Anne's County was the only public school district in Maryland that offered clay target teams as an engaging extracurricular activity, not to mention scholarship opportunities.\nSaelens thanked Connolly for his leadership and passion to bring the sport to students, but said at this time the district will not be expanding the program.\n\"I think we are very blessed and very lucky that we have had this opportunity in this district,\" she said.\nThe Queen Anne's School District is insured through the Maryland Association of Boards of Education (MABE), and although the target team covers its own insurance, the MABE attorney has cautioned districts against expanding target teams due to affiliation that could potentially expose districts to potential risk and litigation.\nCurrently Queen Anne's County School District pays an increased premium for any firearms within the district, including school resource officers funded through the Queen Anne's County Sheriff's Department, according to Saelens.\nMABE will be meeting again in April to consider revisions and amendments, including potentially increasing premiums, she said.\nAt the moment, the district will keep the team limit as it is and wait to see how the MABE discussion unfolds.\nConnolly said he understood the decision and thanked the board and superintendent for their time.\nThe Queen Anne's County Board of Education will next meet for a work session March 20 at 5 p.m. and hold a regular meeting April 10 at 6 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The board also heard from Talbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones about the district's research into whether this club could be created at TCPS.\nDuring public comment, Sheriff Joe Gamble spoke on behalf of the Talbot County Sheriff's Office about the importance of having a space for a group of teens to come together and be a part of something.\n\"We all know kids want to be a part of a group, they want to be a part of something,\" he said. \"The Sheriff's Office fully supports another venue for our youth to connect with other people of like-minded and like interests.\"\nAustin Eader, a ninth grader at Easton High School, said that this week he gathered 191 student signatures and 24 teacher and staff signatures from people who support having the club.\nMany of people interested in starting the club, including Talbot Rod & Gun Club President Joe Capozzoli, spoke at a board meeting in October requesting approval to create the club.\nAfter that meeting, TCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi instructed her staff to look into what it would take to make the club happen. At the meeting Wednesday, Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction Helga Einhorn said Jones has been leading that charge.\nJones told the board that the district has been meeting with those interested in starting the club to gather more information. She said the biggest concern right now is figuring out if the club could in any way jeopardize the district financially — particularly from a risk management perspective.\nShe said that although they have heard about the training and safety precautions required to participate in the program, it still involves putting a firearm in students' hands.\n\"We have to be very thoughtful about that,\" she said.\nThe district has gone to its insurance provider, the Maryland Association of Boards of Education Group Insurance Pool. Jones said a discussion around the topic was held at a February MABE meeting, and MABE intends to hold a session and vote on this at its annual meeting in late April.\nJones said the district will need to consider whether MABE will continue to provide liability coverage if an incident were to happen and, if so, whether it would be at an additional cost. She said the district doesn't have these answers yet because MABE hasn't voted on it yet.\nJones said she should have these answers for the May Board of Education meeting.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said the board and district are at MABE's mercy at this point. She said that as long as MABE has this discussion in April, the board should be able to make a firm decision in May regarding the creation of the club.\nAt the end of the meeting, board member Deborah Bridges said she is on board with the creation of the team.\n\"I think it would be a wonderful addition to our county,\" she said. \"I think it's important because girls can do it too. And there's limited access for females these days. And also for the children that can't do regular athletics, because they can be a part of it too.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He is serving the final months of David Bromwell's term as superintendent. Bromwell officially stepped down from the position March 1.\nBefore taking on the role of interim superintendent, Thompson served as assistant superintendent for DCPS. He began that role in September.\nThompson, who was sworn in to the Talbot County Board of Education in December of 2022, said in an interview that he will miss working on the Talbot County Board of Education.\n\"I've always been on the other side of the fence in relation to education,\" he said. \"But on the board side, I learned a lot about policy, budgeting and things of that nature. So it was a very valuable experience.\"\nHe said his experience as a board member is beneficial to his new role as interim superintendent, particularly when it comes to understanding the relationship between a superintendent and board of education.\nTCPS Executive Assistant Charlene Gould said Thursday that the governor's office has been notified of the District 1 vacant seat. The governor's office is responsible for appointing someone to fill that seat until Thompson's term expires in 2026.\nThompson said his advice for whoever fills his seat is to listen.\n\"I just learned to listen,\" he said about when he started on the board. \"And then make decisions after I listened to what people had to say.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The day is always well received by students and organizations alike, he said.\nCareer coaches work with students throughout the year to identify those who would most benefit from the program, he said.\nStorck was grateful for the collaboration and thanked the high school administration for leading the way for their students to be on the track to greatness.\n\"They are here because they care about the success of their students,\" he said.\nThroughout the day of career discovery, students received one on one individual learning opportunities from professionals through mock interviews and financial guidance workshops.\nChesapeake College also presented information on what vocational classes can do for career growth and continual development.\nA career fair with 30 local businesses welcomed students to discover hiring opportunities and highlighted skills through a multitude of interests available to them right in their own backyard.\nFounder of local IT company Corsica Technologies, guest speaker Dale Walls shared what perseverance can mean for your own story of success.\nWalls recounted his own rocky childhood after which he found structure and direction in the United States Marine Corps before going on to found Corsica Technologies.\nSince stepping down as CEO, Walls has continued his impressive resume, running marathons, coaching youth football and raising a family.\nEncouraging students to take charge of their lives, Walls noted it was perfectly okay not to know what you wanted to do with your life as a high schooler, as long as you were moving forward trying to identify the kind of person you wanted to be.\nTo do that, he reiterated the importance of setting goals with clarity, having courage and leading the way for future self-success.\n\"You are the one who is going to get you there,\" he said.\nThe day of career exploration is very important to the Rotary Club mindset of \"Service Above Self,\" according to Kent Island chapter President Candi Cook.\nThe job fair helps students explore the local area for career opportunities in one convenient place and helps eliminate the misconception that students need to leave the area to find quality jobs.\n\"There are plenty of opportunities for successful post-high school careers that don't require a college degree and taking on tons of debt,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The second tier is for students who need additional support and the last tier is for students who struggle the most with meeting grade level literacy requirements.\nCCPS works in collaboration with the Professional Development Center for Educators at the University of Delaware where officials continue to develop the multi-tier system to ensure CCPS continues to make data informed decisions when matching students with literacy learning resources.\n\"We want to continue the work we are acknowledged for because our kids deserve it,\" said CCPS's Instructional Coordinator for Elementary English Language Arts, Sherry Eichinger-Wilson.\nThe work of both Eichinger-Wilson and Asplen have allowed CCPS to lead the state for meeting the requirements of the 2019 Ready to Read Act, the science-based program, Science of Reading, and the College and Career Readiness portion of Blueprint for Maryland's Future — a statewide funding initiative that aims to increase education quality and funding in Maryland.\n\"The focus is to make sure that what we offer in our program is aligned to the Science of Reading,\" Eichinger-Wilson said. \"We have a vertical alignment from grades K-12 and we are continuing to evaluate the parts of our program to ensure that they are aligned and that we are meeting the needs of all of our students.\"\nCecil and Washington County are the only two counties in the state to be deemed as Literacy Learning Lab models for leveraging student support aligned with the Science of Reading to improve literacy outcomes for students in fourth through eighth grade. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She smiled at the enjoyment that filled the room. Girls discussed and practiced the best ways to market themselves to achieve their career and education goals.\nHaythe, an economic development veteran and certified economic developer, founded the Foundation of Helping Others Prosper and Excel. Its mission is to help young girls and women lead productive lives in their communities by providing cultural, social, spiritual and educational development.\nThe program serves sixth-grade girls attending middle school. This after-school program covers low self-esteem, bullying, social media, workforce development, economic and community development, financial literacy and more.\n\"We prepare them to be independent and self-sufficient as well as exposing them to opportunities, thought-provoking conversations and activities,\" Haythe said.\nHaythe began the Foundation of HOPE over eight years ago. She said this program has been a community effort since the very beginning.\nDuring the program's early days, Giuffrida's Pizza donated weekly food for the girls to snack on. From there, more and more businesses have assisted in the nutrition of the girls to make sure they are well prepared to learn.\nHaythe said the success of this program would not have been possible without the generous support of volunteers, business partners, board members and donors.\nDuring the pandemic, Haythe and her daughter worked together to create a curriculum for the program. The curriculum, divided into 16 weeks, covered healthy lifestyles, economic development, entrepreneurship and potential futures with education.\nThis week, representatives from Easton Utilities led a presentation by showing a clip from Englehart's favorite movie, \"The Pursuit of Happiness.\" Through the film, Englehart showed the girls how to properly prepare themselves for the working world.\nHe said it was an honor to be invited to speak at the event and support such a commendable foundation. As a human resources professional, he is committed to fostering the growth and development of the next generation by equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to pursue their goals.\n\"I hope it will inspire them to not only envision their future dream jobs but also understand the steps needed to achieve and excel in them,\" Englehart said. \"Moments like these reaffirm my passion for HR and the pivotal role it plays in shaping the workforce of tomorrow.\"\nHis presentation included helping the girls create a career map to reach their goals, developing and practicing an elevator pitch for potential employers, and learning the best ways to write a resume by becoming \"resume detectives\" on practice resumes.\nWhen Englehart finished his presentation, he passed out Easton Utilities swag bags before passing along a final message and gift.\nHe gave each girl his business card and told them that before they started applying for their first job, he would help them develop a resume and do practice interviews to prepare them for the workforce.\nAll the girls crowded around him as Haythe took a photo — big smiles on everyone's face. Haythe thanked Englehart for his time before cleaning the library with the assistance of the cohort of girls.\n\"This program allows me to use my passion for empowering women and girls through economic development strategies,\" Haythe said. \"This after-school program is an alternative narrative from what they hear from peers and social media. They are setting career goals, and the Foundation of HOPE is here to help them achieve those goals.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Board of Education Member Donna DiGiacomo resigns\n\n March 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: News \n \n 547\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — After three years and four months in office, Caroline County Board of Education member Donna DiGiacomo has resigned, citing concerns following a back-and-forth between DiGiacomo and Superintendent Derek Simmons at the board's March 5 meeting.She emailed her resignation to the Maryland Superintendent of Education Monday.\n\"My problem on the board is I care about the students and I care about teachers,\" she said in an interview Monday afternoon. \"I got a lot of pressure to make it look like we all agreed. But the thing that got me that I finally said I cannot in any way, shape or form be associated with was at the March 5 meeting.\"\n\"The superintendent called some employees minions. I was like 'did you just say minions? Mindless people who just do what you say?'\" she said.\nThe exchange between Simmons and DiGiacomo, which can be viewed in the recorded meeting on the board's website, resulted from a conversation in which the superintendent discussed the district's upcoming switch from Apple laptops to Google Chrome ones.\nHe talks about how many people it took to get the computers ready for summer.\n\"For getting the devices ready for summer, we don't quite need quite the large numbers of minions, as the devices come in more ready to go out the door. So it helps us on that end as well,\" he said in the meeting.\nDiGiacomo asks, \"Minions?... I guess just the word kind of offends me… 'Minions' offends me. It did offend me.\"\nSimmons said, \"I didn't mean to offend you. I was thinking Minion movies.\"\nMembers of the board laughed.\nShe said, \"A minion is a person that does what they, without thinking. That is all. It is derogatory.\"\nSimmons responded, \"Wasn't meant to be offensive, Mrs. DiGiacomo.\"\nShe said, \"I don't think anyone would be appreciative of that,\" before the board returned to their initial discussion.\nSimmons did not directly respond to a request for comment about the exchange, though the school district did issue a press release following DiGiacomo's resignation.\nDiGiacomo's term was supposed to end Nov. 30. She came to the position after 20 years as a high school English teacher.\n\"The main statement I am trying to make by resigning eight months early is I do not want anyone to think that I condone what is going on,\" she said.\n\"... I am not trying to start trouble. I just want people to know that I really did try my best,\" she said. \"But I can't be a part of something that doesn't respect the employees. Calling people minions is not respectful. I don't want people to think I quit. It is a moral thing for me.\"\n\"I think the people who voted for me have the right to know why I made that decision,\" she said.\nThe Board of Education's statement on the resignation thanks DiGiacomo for her time on the board.\nIn it, Board President Richard Barton stated, \"On behalf of the Caroline County Board of Education, we thank Mrs. DiGiacomo for the time she spent on the board and appreciate her service to the staff and students of Caroline County Public Schools.\"\nThe board also said, \"regarding the vacancy this resignation creates, the board will discuss options as they pertain to Maryland law with the board attorney at their next meeting.\"\nThe next meeting is on April 2 at 6 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wright was described as an excellent, talented and helpful teacher by her students.\nThe evening was filled with excitement as members of the education community dressed up, ate a decadent dinner and were recognized for their work throughout the year.\nPlenty of tears were shed as finalists for the Teacher of the Year and First-Class Teacher of the Year Awards were honored with acknowledgements from their students, mentors and former teachers that had inspired them.\nGavin Parker, principal of Choptank Elementary School, said he enjoyed the time he got to spend at the event.\n\"It's nice to recognize all the hard work that happens in the buildings,\" Parker said. \"We go through a lot.

    "content": "WKHS celebrates 50 years of student public radio\n\n March 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LISA J. GOTTO Special to the Kent County News | Section: News \n \n 1312\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WORTON — It's just a normal early morning at 90.5 WKHS when we arrive to the radio station at Kent County High School. As the school's first of four instructional periods commences, so does the first student disc jockey take her place at the microphone in the facility's live on-air studio.Over the next few hours, she'll not only intro and recap songs from an extensive, vetted playlist, but she'll talk to the station's loyal listeners about what's going on at school, in the county and the greater world. The delivery is smooth and polished, and left to the reliability of just one's own ears, you'd never know that this DJ isn't even 18 years old yet.\nToday, senior Emma Morris is joined by senior Averie Hitzges, and the subject of conversation for a bit is a reminder that it is the last day of the station's spring fundraising drive. As is the case with any enterprise of this nature, donations are not only welcomed, but they're vital.\nTo date, those donations have been coming in from loyal listeners and community partners for 50 years — an amazing feat, especially when you consider that the young people who are populating the air waves with their voices did not grow up listening to traditional radio at all.\nSo in a social culture where it's more likely you're going to listen to a podcast downloaded to your phone during drive-time than a local radio station, how does this eight-studio, 17,500-watt local station remain relevant and a vital part of the high school's Career and Technical Education program?\nAn essential part of that success can be attributed to the current station manager, Chris Singleton. At the helm since 2008, Singleton was quick to point out that he is just one of a long line of integral station managers WKHS has had the good fortune to work with since that first day in 1974 when they went on-air with their format of educational and public affairs-type programming, as well as a wide-ranging playlist that began mid-morning on the March 28.\nAppropriately enough, that first tune played was Elton John's signature hit, \"Rocket Man,\" relayed Singleton, who obviously understands the importance of a mission and knowing when it's time to come back down to Earth.\nWith every school year, he said, he does contend with a student body that might not understand the connection and importance of continuing the legacy of the radio station at the school.\n\"It's like having a kid attend culinary school, when they've never even tasted food,\" he analogized.\nObviously, his plan for getting kids invested is working, as when the bell rings the senior DJs are replaced with equally fresh-faced junior class DJs — and the next portion of the school-day broadcast continues.\nSenior Lizzy Watkins, 18, is just one of the students who became invested in the program for the 2023-2024 school year. She was at the station that morning conducting a bunch of tasks; everything from providing the morning's weather forecast to working on an on-going project that flexes her creative muscles.\nWatkins aspires to a career in graphic design and gets to try her hand, and brain, at projects geared to such things as part of her role at the station.\n\"So for me, because I'm going into graphic design and marketing, being here allows me to start to feel what it is that graphic designers do when they're being handed something from a customer who asks, 'Hey, can you do this?'\"\nWatkins said the process of being able to create and talk through the collaborative process is giving her valuable real-life experience and has helped build her self-confidence.\nFor junior, Jonah Elburn, 16, it's the sense of professionalism that he feels when enters the station each day.\n\"This is something that I love more than anything. It feels, and everyone says it, not like you're in high school, but you're in a working environment,\" Elburn said. \"There's a professionalism that at least the vast majority of people that step through these doors have, the way everything has grown [here] as a business. This is not just another high school class. This is a business.\"\nSoon after, the \"business-of-broadcasting\" tour took us down a hall where the stacks of LPs and 45s used to be kept for easy access to the then two-studio station. Things have changed quite a bit since then, but not until 2018 did the station have its most comprehensive infrastructure upgrade, Singleton said.\nThe $160,000 station remodel included the addition of six new studios, including an enlarged, on-air studio, a dedicated newsroom, production studios and various equipment upgrades.\nSingleton said they were finally able to address the problem of flimsy, particle-board type walls replacing them with structures that were more acoustically sound, and they were able to incorporate an adjacent classroom into their footprint by taking down a wall. This classroom now houses the station's carefully curated collection of nostalgic radio receivers, audio consoles and other equipment from days gone by that provide a visual history of radio broadcasting.\nOn hand, and actually pitching in for every upgrade, was Singleton and another essential member of the staff, Ken Collins. Collins thoroughly enjoys his part-time role in sales and fundraising for the station, and shares many of Singleton's memories of what it took to get the station to the point where it could be celebrating its 50th year in student public radio.\nCollins' role, said Singleton, was part of a larger initiative dating back to 2013, when Kent County Schools welcomed a new administrator, Dr. Karen Couch. It was at that time, said Singleton, that he was most concerned about the future of the broadcasting program at the high school. There had already been substantial talk about whether or not the station would remain a viable part of the curriculum.\nSingleton was certainly hoping that a new administration didn't signal the demise of one of the school's oldest programs. The advent of new technologies and ways of thinking could easily have derailed the plans he already had for what was needed next to keep it going.\nFortunately, after much in-depth conversation with the superintendent, Singleton learned that he could count on her to support his efforts to keep the program going. Couch, who retires this year, would champion the program again by allowing the station to hire for the part-time fundraising position that Collins would eventually fill.\n\"This would not have happened if we didn't have superintendent-level support,\" Singleton said. \"So, we're hopeful that the incoming superintendent could be just as passionate and just as enthusiastic. I think, hopefully coming off of this 50th anniversary wave and with all the positive community dynamics, the new superintendent will pick up on that and go, 'Yeah, this is something we probably need to keep going.' And until they give me a reason not to, we'll just keep on going.\"\nThe next big thing, said Singleton, is the biggest thing of all. Literally. The station's tower, actually the oldest piece of infrastructure being erected in 1973, now needs to be replaced. This is Singleton's newest mission.\n\"I would much rather be able to replace that proactively, than the alternative of just having it come down on its own.\"\nAnd so, the station's story is still being written and the program continues to inspire the students who reach out to embrace it.\n\"For whom we are and what we have, I am pretty happy for where we are,\" said Singleton.\nAn official station birthday celebration will be held on Saturday, May 4, from 1 to 5 p.m. at Red Acres Farm in Worton. The event called Tune Fest will feature live music from five area bands: Sombarkin', Justin Singleton, Phillip Dutton & the Alligators, The Good Stuff and The Blake Thompson Band. Festival goers also will enjoy a menu of offerings from local food trucks and connecting with many of the station's staff members, past and present. Tickets are $25 per person.

    "content": "Students embrace history once again in regional competition\n\n March 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ERIC SYLVIA Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 578\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS — Nearly 200 local middle and high school students participated in the annual regional history day event held once again at Chesapeake College.Organized by Queen Anne's County Public Schools teacher Thomas Hayman, the March 23 event welcomed 30 area teachers and a troupe of volunteers who hosted six schools. Schools participating in this year's event represented Caroline, Cecil, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties. This year's theme was Turning Points in History.\nProjects entered this year covered a wide range of topics, as students used a lot of creativity to make their cases.\nTopics covered included pop-culture history, topics related to women's rights and the Great Depression, as well as improvement in technology and even the advent of fast-food and its impact on history.\nThe students work hard to get to this level of the competition by first competing at the local level within their home school. The next step is this regional event, with the winners invited to participate in the Maryland statewide competition.\nAt each level, judges provide feedback the students can use to improve their project for the next competition.\nHayman says the event started as an after-school program he became involved in when he first began his teaching career. As the number of students grew, and the national event began to take shape, local programs also grew.\nEastern Shore counties previously had individual county-level events, but they decided to form a coalition in 2017 in order to be more competitive at the state level.\nThe plan worked — Hayman reports in the five years the Upper Shore Regional event has been held, two area students have gone on to compete in the national event.\nThe regional event sends the top two from each category, from each county to the state event. The state only sends the top two in each category to the national event.\nThe event is offered in conjunction with National History Day and Maryland Humanities, and it is intended to help foster a love of history in the students who participate. Students submit projects in five categories: Paper (Individual), Website, Performance, Documentary and Exhibit.\nThey can submit content as either individuals or in groups of up to five students. There are now three divisions — a youth division for students in the fifth grade, the Junior Division for students of grades six to eight and the Senior Division for students grades nine to 12.\nThe regional event is funded by Maryland Humanities, which is also responsible for hosting the state event. Hayman said Chesapeake College also played a vital role, donating the space for the exhibits, presentations and performances free of charge — a location providing a more central location than previous venues. Food trucks rounded out the day's festivities for the students.\nThese students make a choice to put in extra hours to work on their projects outside of their normal school work, Hayman said. Many of the students who participate, come back multiple years to compete, each year improving their research and presentation skills. The amount of effort and dedication these projects require rivals similar science contests.\nWhile not all participants went home with an award, the judges handed out over 50 awards to the students, including: Sports History Award, Heritage Award, Natural History Award, Military History Award, Contemporary World History Award, African American History Award, Colonial History Award, Equality in History Award, Medical History Award, and the Chesapeake Bay/Maritime Award. First, second and third place finishes as well as Best in Region awards were also given in each category. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In education, tier one instruction is instruction given to the entire classroom.\n\"Right now we see the deficit across the district as it relates to tier one instruction,\" Thompson said. \"And this is the way that we think we're going to improve our tier one instruction, by providing professional development to our leadership.\"\nThompson said the district has to put its money where its mouth is.\n\"We're trying to shift our mindset to put instruction first,\" he said. \"And we believe that this is the way to do it: By training our staff and training our leadership to be instructional leaders.\"\nThompson said Creative Leadership Solutions will cater their services to what the district needs.\nAt a Cambridge City Council meeting later that day, Thompson gave a presentation to the council on the overall picture of the school system where he talked about the need for improving tier one instruction. He spoke about the importance of having a school calendar that allows the district to provide time for professional development.\n\"We can't expect teachers to be good at their craft if we're not continuously training them to be better at their craft,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jamie Raskin's planned lecture on democracy Thursday at the University of Maryland instead turned into a lively discussion on the Israel-Hamas conflict.Raskin was invited to give the Irving and Renee Milchberg Endowed Lecture and his intended subject was \"Democracy, Autocracy and the Threat to Reason in the 21st Century.\"\n\"Progress in history requires not just reasoning, which is certainly necessary, but it's not sufficient, because it also requires the addition of the pro-social emotions, as the psychologists call it, of solidarity, empathy, love and the political virtues of justice and equality and freedom,\" Raskin said at the start of his speech.\nHis remarks were interrupted just a few minutes later by pro-Palestinian protesters shouting that Raskin is was \"complicit in genocide.\" In response, Raskin said that he wished the protesters had engaged in a conversation with him, rather than \"heckling.\"\nRaskin emphasized that he has taken a strong position on returning the hostages held by Hamas, has advocated a military ceasefire, and has championed a two-state solution. As he attempted to continue his lecture, protesters continued interrupting and shouting. Various protesters questioned Raskin's actions since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\"We need a new peace movement too, if you are the representatives of it,\" Raskin said. \"Because you're not engaging in real dialogue with people and you're not convincing anybody.\"\nProtesters supporting Israel and those backing Palestine from both sides continued heckling and arguing with each other, making it impossible for Raskin to continue. He then abandoned the speech and said he was open to taking questions from the audience, leading to more discourse among protesters.\n\"It's very tough to solve problems in the Middle East here at the University of Maryland in the physics department,\" Raskin said.\nDarryll Pines, the president of the university, later stepped in and terminated the lecture early.\n\"He came here to speak about where our democracy is going in our country,\" Pines told Capital News Service. \"What you saw play out actually was democracy and free speech and academic freedom. From our perspective as a university, there are the difficult conversations that we should be having.\"\nPines added that he wished, however, that the protesters had been more civil. He also praised Raskin's patience and empathy when responding to the protesters' comments and questions.\n\"I wanted to make a plea for constitutional patriotism in defense of democracy and freedom around the world,\" Raskin told CNS about his original speech. \"Their sentiments were perfectly consistent with a lot of what I had to say.\"\n\"I'm not really opposed to heckling,\" the congressman added. \"But it seems like heckling today is all about drowning out the speaker, and that's totally antithetical to the spirit of free expression.\"\nHoward Milchberg, University of Maryland professor of physics and electrical and computer engineering, along with his wife Rena Milchberg and their three children, started the lecture in 2019. It celebrates the memory of Howard Milchberg's late parents, who survived the Holocaust.\n\"It didn't go as planned, but it maybe turned out better than normal,\" Howard Milchberg told CNS. \"It was an actual exercise of democracy rather than a story about democracy.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Rice III as its new executive director.With a deep background in outdoor education, event management, and strategic planning, Rice brings a wealth of experience and a passion for environmental education to his new role.\nRice has been an integral part of the Echo Hill Outdoor School team since 2014, serving in various capacities, including interim executive director, assistant director, senior naturalist and USCG captain.\nDuring his tenure at Echo Hill, Rice has demonstrated exceptional leadership skills in overseeing day-to-day operations, employee relations and program expansion, the outdoor school said in a press release. He has also been instrumental in building new avenues of fundraising to support the school's mission.\n\"I am honored and excited to take on the role of executive director at Echo Hill Outdoor School,\" said Rice. \"The School's program is proven — it's been around for 50 years. Statistically, for a nonprofit, that's an incredible feat. We have returning schools come year after year. But there is a lot of room to grow and reach further. I have big shoes to fill and I'm ready for the challenge.\"\nRice's dedication to outdoor education extends beyond his work at Echo Hill Outdoor School. He has previously served as associate director at Echo Hill Camp, where he played a key role in strategic planning, staff management and safety oversight.\nPrior to joining Echo Hill Camp, Rice held positions at New York Road Runners and Tough Mudder, where he gained valuable experience in event management and logistics.\nRice will serve as only the second executive director in the Echo Hill's history. Since Echo Hill Outdoor School's establishment in 1972, Rice's father, Peter Rice Jr., has led the institution until his recent retirement.\nWith a passionate board and a team of dedicated and talented staff, he developed its groundbreaking, back-to-basics environmental curriculum through educational programs that celebrated the transformative joy of nature. Under the older Rice's 51-year span of leadership, Echo Hill grew into a year-round organization, adding full time staff and educators and embarking on major capital improvements like dorms, adventure courses and a fleet of traditional Chesapeake workboats to provide on-the-water experiences.\nThe older Rice's visionary leadership in outdoor education has provided countless students with transformative outdoor experiences, instilling a lifelong love for the natural world. His commitment to education, coupled with his innovative approach, established Echo Hill Outdoor School as a cornerstone of environmental education in the region.\nThe younger Rice continues this legacy with a steadfast commitment to the School's mission — and a core belief that fun, hands-on experiences in the Chesapeake's outdoors have the power to inspire and uplift children.\n\"We are thrilled to have Petey Rice as our new Executive Director,\" said Robert Creamer, president of the Board of Directors at Echo Hill Outdoor School. \"He was selected unanimously by our search committee after a very extensive review process that drew 15 well-qualified applicants. Petey's extensive supervisory experience, his fresh ideas, his approach to fundraising, and his commitment to our mission were what we were looking for. As an executive board, we had to find the leader of Echo Hill Outdoor School for the next 50 years—someone who could guide the organization through changes in education and schooling, and who could help create a culture for our staff where people feel appreciated and love to work. All of these factors made him the ideal candidate to lead our organization into the future.\"\nAs executive director, Rice will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of Echo Hill Outdoor School's operations, including staff administration, program design, fundraising and community outreach. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Though the state of Maryland wasn't on the path of totality, the moon blocked out nearly 90 percent of the sun at about 3:20 p.m. Monday over the Country School.\nTeachers prepared for the eclipse by teaching students about eclipse viewing safety and the science behind an eclipse.\nA solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, thereby obscuring the view of the sun from a small part of Earth, totally or partially.\nJean Waller Brune, acting head of school at The Country School, said preparing for the solar eclipse was wonderful.\n\"It's amazing to be here and help our students understand what a solar eclipse is and how to look at it safely,\" Brune said. \"They've all been little scientists out here, and to do it together in community as a school is just a thrill.\"\nIn science classrooms, students labeled on worksheets the eclipse process while watching a NASA live stream of the celestial event.\nAs the eclipse neared, students sat outside eagerly watching the sun through their brightly decorated eclipse masks made from colored paper plates and certified eclipse glasses.\nWhen the eclipse finally reached a moment of near totality, teachers and students alike watched in excitement as the sky darkened and the moon slowly covered the sun.\nAnn Hansen, pre-k teacher's assistant, said it meant a lot to her to share this moment with her students.\n\"They will hopefully remember this for a long time,\" Hansen said. \"It makes me so happy that we can do something like this at our school.

He said he sees his students and coworkers as his family.\n\"I told my whole table, I said, 'I live down here. I don't have family down here. I don't have any children. And my students are my family, and my coworkers and my friends are my family,'\" he said.\nHillyard has taught at EHS since 2010.

EHS School Manager Toni Hall said Steele works \"extremely hard\" to provide support to students in math through translating, tutoring and making sure students understand the concepts. Hall said one of the greatest challenges English as a second language teachers face is having new students enter the program throughout the year.\n\"Ms. Steele is invaluable in helping these students prepare to move into algebra, a critical step in their educational journey,\" Hall said. \"She always greets new students with a smile, making them feel welcome and comfortable, and helping them learn an unfamiliar concept.\"\nRegina Coleman, school security officer at Easton Middle School, and Chanae Neal, an instructional assistant for special education at Easton Elementary School, were also finalists for the Support Staff of the Year title.\nLutisia Blessing, A pre-K teacher at White Marsh Elementary School, and Marissa Carter, a third grade math teacher at St. Michaels Elementary School, were the finalists for the Teacher of the Year title.\nHillyard congratulated his fellow finalists in his speech.\n\"I emailed them last weekend. I said, 'I wish there could be three teachers of the year instead of one,'\" he said. \"It's such an honor to stand in the middle of two other amazing educators, and I'm so glad I work with you.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chesapeake College shapes Eastern Shore's future\n\n April 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CLIFFORD P. COPPERSMITH | Section: Columns \n \n 750\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The new Chesapeake College brand, launched this academic year, highlights our role in preparing our students for \"what's next.\" Our students choose their own goals — whether that is transfer to a bachelor's degree program or entry into a career — but our job is to help them acquire the relevant skills, knowledge and experiences to be successful.This role is at the heart of what our faculty, staff, and administrators do each day. We love to see our students succeed and move on to what's next in their lives. These individual successes echo throughout our community on the Eastern Shore, bolstering a vibrant economic cycle that benefits everyone in our service area.\nOur efforts yield tangible results in our community. When we empower individuals with the skills they need to succeed, we are not only transforming lives but also strengthening our local economy. A skilled workforce attracts businesses, drives innovation, and fosters economic growth. Chesapeake College is proud to be a catalyst for positive change in our community, creating pathways to prosperity for all.\nOur collaborative endeavors with partners in K-12 education, four-year institutions, local businesses, and economic leaders are crucial. This year we hosted nearly 150 of these partners at our Program Advisory Committee mixer — our largest to date. Together, we create curricula that resonate with real-world demands, ensuring both our credit and noncredit programs offer engaging and pertinent learning experiences. This collaboration is vital as we align our educational offerings with the needs of the workforce and the expectations of our community.\nThe influence of Chesapeake College graduates is unmistakable across various sectors. Once again, our nursing program boasted a 100% pass rate on the National Council of Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses. As a result of partnership with our public schools, local educators are taking classes to become certified teachers, and others are earning a childcare development associate certificate, helping to fill critical gaps for early childhood education. From health care to education, construction trades to computer science, our alumni are integral to the local workforce.\nWe recognize that not every great career requires the traditional college path. Careers in the skilled trades can be lucrative and rewarding for students, developing a broad variety of talents as well as skills in problem-solving, customer service, and communication.\nThis year, responding to the needs of local employers, Chesapeake expanded our trades offerings and launched a new advanced manufacturing program. We now have students learning the latest skills with hands-on experience using 3D printers, CNC machines, and robotics, preparing them for the high-tech jobs of tomorrow. Additionally, we continue to expand existing offerings in construction, HVAC, welding and marine services.\nOur enrollment is up 9.5% this year, continuing the growth we celebrated last year. This increase is a testament to the relevance and appeal of our programs — as well as to the impact of Maryland Blueprint for Education legislation, which expands opportunities for dual enrolled high school students. It prompts us to consider sustainable strategies for addressing the accompanying challenges, including funding and tuition adjustments, to ensure that our growth remains inclusive.\nWe continue doing our work as effectively and efficiently as possible, stewarding the critical resources provided by our state, our five support counties, and our students. As we all know, resources are tight and the state of Maryland faces challenges in funding higher education. We appreciate the support we receive from all of our funding authorities and will continue to be responsible stewards as we make every effort to serve our students and our regional community to the best of our ability.\nAs we look to the future, it's essential to recognize the challenges ahead. Access to education remains a pressing issue, with many individuals facing barriers such as financial constraints, lack of transportation, or childcare responsibilities. Addressing these challenges requires a collective effort from policymakers, community leaders, and educational institutions like Chesapeake College. We must work together to ensure that everyone has equal access to the opportunities afforded by education.\nAt Chesapeake College, we are dedicated to fostering the skills that will drive the future, preparing our students to face tomorrow's challenges with confidence and competence. Together, we are setting the stage for a thriving, prosperous future on the Eastern Shore.\nAs we continue to cultivate optimism through our actions and initiatives, I invite you to share in the vision of a promising future here at Chesapeake College — a treasure of the Eastern Shore, steadfast in its mission to empower individuals and enrich our community.\nClifford P. Coppersmith is the president of Chesapeake College. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Beyond Words brings creative and innovative opportunities to the Shore\n\n April 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TAMARA FORTE Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 887\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE — As a special education teacher and a parent to a dyslexic child, Lindsey Parte has lived through the struggles and tears of traditional education and understands firsthand the challenges that affect all types of learners.Parte has focused her 18-year teaching career on teaching struggling learners how to read. Working with students in kindergarten through high school, she is a structured literacy dyslexia specialist and certified in Orton Gillingham. Parte's mission is to increase educational resources for not only her local community — the children of the Eastern Shore — but for all children no matter where they live.\nThis is where Beyond Words Tutoring was born.\nBeyond Words Tutoring is a new educational business, located at The Edge Area on 325 Log Canoe Circle in Stevensville. It offers four innovative services: a hybrid homeschooling program, virtual dyslexia tutoring, academic summer camps, and non-attorney special education advocate services.\nThis licensed, part-time hybrid homeschooling program is creative and flexible and welcomes students ages 6 to 11.\nParte explains the program \"supports families who want to homeschool, but cannot commit to it full-time. It's the opportunity to do school and life with other families. To teach them in creative and innovative ways. It's child-led learning.\"\nThe program is three days a week Monday, Tuesday and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and will operate from Sept. 9 to May 15, 2025. The program allows for longer holiday breaks and does not follow the typical school calendar. Currently, there are 11 available spots with a small \"class\" size to allow for small group 1:1 attention.\nBeyond Words Hybrid Homeschooling Program is a microschool that is open to all learners, not just dyslexic learners. This educational alternative aims at reducing student wait time, enriching past a set of grade-level expectations, going beyond a fixed curriculum and meeting the individual's needs.\nA microschool is a non-traditional educational setting where students are learning side-by-side with learners of various ages and abilities. Think of it like a one room schoolhouse, Parte explains.\nMicroschools have become increasingly popular as families are desiring more personalized and engaging learning for their children. The students enrolled at Beyond Words Hybrid Homeschool Program are considered homeschooled students which allows parents to have more involvement in their child's education. This also means that parents are the ones responsible to meet the compulsory attendance laws under COMAR.\nThe focus of the homeschool group is math and reading. Parte said a lot of families who want to homeschool do not want to focus on being the only one teaching their child to read. She said, \"for many reasons families do not want to focus on teaching reading. It may not be in their wheelhouse, or they don't feel comfortable. So, for me to take (the reading and math) off (the parents') plate\" helps in many ways.\nBesides math and reading, the hybrid homeschool program also includes: nature, STEAM/Science Maker Space activities, arts and crafts, and kindness activities. Since the classroom location backs right up to Terrapin Nature Park, weekly activities may include nature sketching, hiking, going on adventures, forest bathing (meditative walks), community service projects and compassion circles.\nParte said she is \"huge into the mental health aspect and teaching the kids self-regulation and growth mindset.\" And stresses that she \"is building a community where the kids feel safe and comfortable. It's building a family. It is teaching them to be okay with who they are and teaching them to look out for each other and others in our community.\"\nIn order to gain a hybrid homeschooling program spot for the 2024-25 school year, there is a screening process to ensure it is a good fit for the family and the teacher. There is a curiosity form online for those interested.\nVirtual dyslexia tutoring is another offered resource. Currently these tutoring sessions utilize Orton Gillingham, are one-on-on and are individualized. Ages 6 through high school are welcome. Parte is currently tutoring middle school students as far as California, as there is a need for her specialized training everywhere.\nTutoring openings occur later at night, 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. as needed. For the 2024-25 school year, there will be nine openings for the virtual tutoring spots.\nAnother resource at Beyond Words is the academic summer camp, which prevents summer slide, or educational regression, over the summer in an atmosphere that also encourages meeting like-minded friends.\nCamp activities include math, reading, writing, STEM and more. Last year, Parte said she drove her son, Lincoln, three hours to be a part of a similar dyslexic school camp. After driving that far, Parte is excited to bring this resource closer to all those on the Eastern Shore. The camp runs from July 29 to Aug. 16 from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.\nStudents can participate in one or more of the three-week camp programs.\nThe last available service at Beyond Words Tutoring is non-attorney special education advocate services. These consulting and advocacy services empower parents to be effective advocates for their children in the Individualized Education Program process. This includes understanding the IEP documents as well as ensuring all your child's academic and behavior needs and goals are met.\nCurrently, Beyond Words Tutoring is still looking for donations of comfortable seating (like bean bags and foam seats), rugs, tables, chairs, art and crafts supplies, paper, markers, old legos, building blocks and other school supplies.\nFor more information visit www.beyondwordstutoring.com or email lindseyparte@beyondwordstutoring.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

William Smallwood being a slave owner.\nJack Tuttle, a content specialist for the school system, elaborated on Smallwood's history from his findings in the Maryland state archives.\nSmallwood was born in 1732 and grew up in Charles County, and his family had already been wealthy plantation owners before his birth, Tuttle's presentation said.\nIn 1761, Smallwood became a Charles County delegate to the assembly and served in the seat for 11 years prior to the Revolutionary War.\nHe joined Charles County's committee of correspondence in 1774, which was a political organization against the British that was dedicated to spreading information, Tuttle's presentation said.\nIn 1776, Smallwood joined the Revolutionary War effort as a colonel, then eventually brigadier general of the First Maryland Regiment. He was promoted to major general based on campaigns throughout the East Coast.\nBy 1790, Smallwood owned 4,350 acres in Charles County and had 56 enslaved people working on his plantation. He served as Maryland's governor from 1785 to 1788 before he died in 1792, Tuttle said.\nCharles public school system will survey the community to garner perspective from students, staff, families, the Smallwood school feeder community, elected officials and advocacy groups on changing the school's name, Superintendent Maria Navarro said.\nNavarro proposed that all outreach would take place throughout May and early June and the results of the survey would be presented at a June board of education meeting.\nThe cost of changing the school's name could span anywhere from $64,500 to $124,500, with most of the variance coming from the type of sign the school chooses, according to Tuttle and Navarro's presentation. A traditional sign would cost about $10,000, while an LED digital sign would cost upward of $70,000.\nOther potential costs include $35,000 for exterior school lettering, $3,000 for school graphic window film, $10,000 for school plaques, $1,000 for school banners and $5,500 for athletic uniforms.\nNavarro reminded board members of Board Policy 7230, which states that a vote to rename the school cannot be held until at least three intervening school board meetings after notification to the school's community. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Battle lines being drawn for tax fights in 2025\n\n April 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 790\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier this month I joined countless Marylanders in filing my federal and state income tax returns.As I did so, the timeless observations of Benjamin Franklin came to mind: \"In this world nothing is certain except death and taxes.\"\nAfter the Maryland General Assembly adjourned, I suggest Ben was only partly right.\nI suggest that in Maryland, almost certain are new state taxes, state tax increases, new state fees and state fee increases. The only uncertainties about them are when and how much.\nBefore the 2024 Maryland General Assembly adjourned for the year, this matter was discussed at length but never fully settled. Some relatively modest tax and fee increases were approved, but none as large as or as far reaching as expected.\nNone will be approved throughout the balance of this year. The earliest formal discussions on any tax increases can happen is after the General Assembly reconvenes in January 2025.\nBattle lines are already being drawn.\nProponents and opponents of tax increases are busy organizing and promoting their positions. Not surprisingly, there are stark and irreconcilable differences between them.\nThe Maryland Public Policy Institute recently released a statement headlined \"Tax increases Are Never Inevitable.\"\nThe statement includes the following messages: \"Maryland's political leaders would have us believe the state is in a fiscal mess through no fault of their own and that the only solution is massive tax hikes that they've put on hold — for now. This narrative, however, both misrepresents the problem and ignores a real and preferable solution. When pressed, responsible lawmakers admit that the primary cause of the budget chaos at both state and county levels is the Blueprint for Maryland's Future (a.k.a. Kirwan) education plan. The Spending Affordability Committee projected that budget shortfalls will increase substantially over the next five years \"due to the need for general funds to support costs related to the Blueprint.\"\nThe recommended treatments are to \"minimize the enactment of new mandates,\" increase \"efficiency,\" and \"consider revenue options.\" Sadly, legislators seem focused only on that last tactic — i.e., tax hikes. But the Blueprint is not Holy Writ etched in stone. And tax hikes on hard-working Marylanders are not inevitable. Instead of pretending to have no way out, lawmakers could choose to alter the Blueprint's mandates or eliminate it altogether.\"\nSupporters of Kirwan especially the Democratic super majorities in the General Assembly and the state teachers' union have a much different view.\nThey support increasing state revenues to a level to ensure Kirwan is fully implemented as it was written when the current version was approved by the General Assembly.\nThey believe they have public support for that. They may be right.\nA recent article in the Baltimore Sun had the following headline: \"Majority of Statewide Voters Support Blueprint for Maryland's Future.\"\nThe article included the following.\n\"An overwhelming majority of Marylanders support the state's ambitious Blueprint for Maryland's Future education plan, according to a new poll done for The Baltimore Sun, the University of Baltimore and FOX45. Nearly three quarters of the 1,300 likely general election voters polled across Maryland said they supported the Blueprint. When the poll asked about potential changes to the plan to lessen its financial pressures on local [education] budgets, 55% said they supported making some reduction, such as cutting all-day prekindergarten programs (24%), or teacher pay raises (11%). However, 29% said they would not cut anything.'\"\nThe professional pollster who conducted the survey opined the results indicate \"profound, widespread\" support among voters for the landmark education plan, tempered by \"a willingness to set adjustments.\nHe further observed, \"It's very hard to argue against public education. The intent [of the Blueprint] tracks with the priorities of Maryland voters.\"\nI suggest the results of this survey, like the results of all surveys, only reflect public sentiment at a point in time. How durable those poll results has yet to be seen.\nThe pollster did acknowledge one huge unresolved issue that cannot be ignored going forward.\nHe said, \"Local school boards will have to balance how to fund their school districts with meeting their Blueprint financial burden, which could force [school board] members to cut local initiatives. Will it force school boards to cut other things? That's where the electoral equation changes.\"\nThat is a key observation that leads to more certainty on discussions and debates on taxes and fees in Maryland.\nBetween now and January 2025, supporters and opponents of Kirwan will be aggressively engaged in efforts to inform, galvanize and mobilize voters to support their respective positions ranging from maintaining Kirwan as presently written, adopting modifications to Kirwan and the necessity for and scope of revenue sources needed to fully fund implantation of whatever the final form Kirwan turns out to be.\nDepending on the outcomes, those efforts may continue well beyond next year.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chesapeake Multicultural after-school program lets students learn through taste\n\n April 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 541\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On Thursday evening, over a dozen fourth and fifth graders walked through Bonheur Ice Cream and Pie in downtown Easton and learned from local chefs of the profession of devoting themselves to sweets.These students are part of the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center After-school Program, a program designed to enrich Hispanic elementary school students of Talbot County.\nDuring the program, students focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics; reading skills; and food supplement nutrition education to ensure they are educated and well prepared for lessons inside and outside of the classroom.\nEstela-Vianney Ramirez, assistant director of the after-school program, said she has been working with the program for over a decade, and it is a beautiful experience to help expand the world for these students.\n\"It's very rewarding to teach the class,\" Ramirez said. \"Those memories really stick in their, the students', minds and enable them to actually give out to the community, too, because some of our volunteers in our after-school program were our students who went through the program 10 years ago.\"\nRamirez notes that she sees her former students working in offices and throughout the Eastern Shore, and she is happy to be a part of their development.\nDuring the tour of Bonheur, Chef Tyler Heim brought the students to the kitchen and explained the process of making ice cream and the work that goes into every pint. One by one, students were moved throughout the kitchen and shown the behind-the-scenes of sweet treats and rich desserts.\nJulia Foxwell, director of community engagement for Bluepoint Hospitality, said it was a delight for the chefs to share their passion for sweets with the students.\n\"We have been working with the Chesapeake Multicultural Center for some time on how best to support their initiatives while also providing enriching experiences to their students,\" Foxwell said. \"Bringing the girls and boys in to learn kitchen basics — from prep to final product — exposes them to new concepts, flavors and perhaps a future passion of their own. Chefs (Harley) Peet and Heim loved hosting the kids in the kitchen and even got a few ideas for new flavors.\"\nVictoria Gomez Lozano, Hispanic outreach coordinator for Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said this program is important in reaching out to community members who may not know about the center's services.\n\"We started this program to give the underserved children of this community the opportunity to have extracurricular activities and to be exposed to a lot of things that they may not have the opportunity to,\" Gomez Lozano said. \"It's also a good way to contact their parents and the families in the community as well so they can open up to us and so we can give them our services.\"\nAt the end of the tour, every student was given a scoop of ice cream and a choice of toppings to create their own flavor.\nEach student enjoyed the ice cream while laughing with friends.\nStudent Yerelin Fuentes said she has been in the after-school program for a few years now and loves the chance to learn new things and spend time with her friends outside of class. But what she loves most, she said, is the ability to learn to be a good person.\n\"They show us how to be a hero,\" Fuentes said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Job opportunities, money available for graduates\n\n April 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPHEN RIDEOUT | Section: Columns \n \n 533\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n These past few weeks have brought me information that I want to share with you about what the Maryland government has available for job possibilities for your graduating high school senior or one who graduated within the past few years and scholarship opportunities for your child, grandchild or possibly even you who are in mid-life or mid-career and are thinking about making a change.I will first take up possible job opportunities for a child or grandchild. This is for someone who is not thinking about college right now or has not gone out looking for a job or has but has no immediate prospects.\nMaryland has created the Department of Service and Civic Innovation that can be found at dsci.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx. If you are a business or nonprofit organization or run a local government, you can sign up to be a host site for graduating seniors or former high school graduates where they can work for a year with the state paying a minimum salary of $15 an hour and health insurance being provided along with $6,000 being set aside for higher education.\nIf you are a young person with no or unsure plans on what you are going to do after graduation or have graduated and do not have a job, you can sign up and find a position where you might be able to work. Work sites have to sign up by May 1 for this group of young people to work and youth have until later in May to sign up. It is a great opportunity for the community, businesses and nonprofits to help our youth build their abilities to work, be mentored and meet other young people from all over the state.\nThis year there were no youth from Dorchester County that applied for a job through this program.\nWith regard to scholarships, earlier this week I learned at a community meeting held by Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) about the Commission on Higher Education. Derrick Colley came and spoke about all of the money that is available through the state for higher education for youth, adults, people who work for the state or local governments and others. The link to that website is mhec.maryland.gov/about/pages/contactus.aspx. I also learned that all of our state delegates and senators have money available themselves for financial aid to students, and they can seek that help by contacting the legislators' offices to learn more.\nThe most interesting and unfortunate thing that I learned about these resources is that every year there is money left over and not used because not enough people seek the assistance.\nI also learned from the conversation among those attending Sample-Hughes' meeting that many of our youth are not motivated to fill out the online application forms and that the way many who attended had to do it was to sit their young family member in front of the computer and help them through the process.\nIf you are reading this and want to help yourself or a family member, go to both websites first and learn more about them and then find that person who needs a job or a scholarship and sit down with them and help them get started.\nStephen Rideout is mayor of Cambridge. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Candidates compete for 3 open Dorchester Board of Education seats\n\n April 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 3224\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Dorchester County Board of Education has three position on the ballot this year for Districts 1, 3 and 5. There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 1 and 5 will appear on the ballot of May 14's primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election. The District 3 candidates will not be on the ballot until November, since only two candidates are registered.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the eight candidates competing for the seats to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity and length. Extended versions of these Q&As are available at stardem.com.\nMIKE HARTFORDMike Hartford is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nFirst-hand knowledge from a parent standpoint on current issues. Outside perspective, from not only a parental standpoint, but from a business standpoint. As a small business owner I feel I have the tools necessary to communicate issues effectively and provide reasonable solutions when problems do arise.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nWe need to focus more on our local needs and suggestions, rather than what the state suggests. Our county is run by the students and the parents. The current board needs to be aware of that. It is about the kids, always.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nMaryland's Blueprint itself is a great concept. We need to adapt to these guidelines and utilize the tools and knowledge we have of our local community to expand the idea further. For Instance, teacher incentives, pay raises and teacher appreciation should be at the forefront of our focus. These are the people who guide the students in the right direction. We need to attract the best talent so we can provide the children the best education they can get. Our country's future depends on it.\nCHRISTINE LAMONICAChristine LaMonica is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a prospective member of the Board of Education, I bring a commitment to fostering positive change and ensuring that every student receives the best possible education in a safe environment.\nI bring a true passion for advocacy for our students, families, and educators to ensure that their voices are heard, and their needs are met within our educational system. This will include advocating for resources for all schools regardless of their socioeconomic status or location, as I believe in the power of inclusive education that celebrates diversity and promotes a sense of belonging for every student.\nAs a board member I would promote transparency and collaboration in decision making. I am looking forward to visiting the schools and listening to the needs of each district, I believe that is paramount in understanding the culture of our schools. I recognize that to make progress, the Board functions best when the members work together towards common goals with open communication and respect.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward? How do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nI am going to combine this question along with the question regarding the Blueprint. Overall, the board and district should work together towards the common goal of student safety, success in learning, and wellness for all students first and foremost, the Blueprint hopefully being a roadmap to help us meet certain objectives.\nAs a candidate and community member I see the Blueprint as a \"challenge,\" and one that has the potential to bring good to our schools, albeit nothing is perfect or easy. As a candidate I think the county and the board are addressing the issues of funding and staffing regarding the requirements of the Blueprint and the future of our education system the best they can right now with the resources available to them. The county and the board are going to have to be creative and resilient with the challenges ahead. We aren't alone or singled out in Dorchester County. Larger counties are facing challenges also. They may have more resources to pull from, but larger populations to serve. We all have our specific barriers to overcome. We see this not only in the education system, but in many public service arenas.\nLUCAS THORPELucas Thorpe is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a candidate for the Board of Education, I bring a unique blend of experience, passion, and dedication to student success. Having previously served as a student member on the board, I understand the inner workings of the education system and the challenges that students face firsthand. This experience has equipped me with valuable insights into the needs and aspirations of our student population.\nIn addition to my board experience, my current work in the nonprofit sector serving Dorchester County Public Schools students has further deepened my understanding of the issues affecting our educational system. Through my role, I have developed innovative programs and initiatives aimed at supporting student growth and achievement.\nI am committed to fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and excellence within the board. My goal is to ensure that every decision made reflects a student-first mindset and contributes to the overall improvement of our educational system.\nFurthermore, I am dedicated to promoting innovation and equity in education. I will work tirelessly to advocate for resources and programs that empower all students to reach their full potential, regardless of their background or circumstances.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe goals that the board and district need to be working toward are multifaceted and require a comprehensive approach to address the challenges facing Dorchester County Public Schools. First and foremost, we need to prioritize improving academic outcomes and student achievement. Currently, DCPS is ranked 23 out of 24 systems in the state of Maryland, which is unacceptable. We must work tirelessly to elevate our educational standards and ensure that every student receives a high-quality education that prepares them for success.\nTo achieve this goal, we need to focus on several key areas:\nLeadership and support.Parent and community involvement.Addressing chronic absenteeism.Discipline and behavioral remediation.College and career readiness.\nThe board and district need to prioritize academic excellence, foster parent and community involvement, address chronic absenteeism and discipline issues, and promote college and career readiness.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nAs a law passed in the Maryland State Legislature, my stance on the Blueprint is clear: I fully support its objectives and initiatives.\nNow, the conversation shifts to how our school system will implement and stay on track with what is outlined in the Blueprint.\nOne key aspect of the Blueprint that I strongly endorse is Pillar 2, which focuses on high quality and diverse teachers and leaders. This pillar mandates that local school systems implement new teacher ladders, including a minimum teacher salary of $60,000 by fiscal year 2026. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of partnering with Historically Black Colleges and Universities to increase and support the pipeline of diverse teachers and leaders. Increasing teacher pay is essential for Dorchester to remain competitive and attract top talent to our schools.\nHowever, it's important to note that while I fully support the Blueprint, it is not currently fully funded by the State of Maryland. Despite a budget surplus in fiscal year 2023, the state is projected to face a structural budget deficit of $761 million by fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2024, DCPS received $58,118,000 in direct state funding and $24,006,038 in funding from the county. Historically, our county commissioners have funded education locally at around 0.0-1.0% above the Maintenance of Effort, whereas neighboring Wicomico County funds at roughly 5.0-10.0% above the MOE. As leaders in the school system and the county council, it's imperative that we collaborate to find ways to fully fund initiatives and programming efforts locally.\nSUSAN MORGANSusan Morgan is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Morgan is the current Board of Education vice president.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nRaise the academic performance of all students in every school, with a particular focus on reading and math.Make kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.Reduce chronic absenteeism.Implement an effective alternative education program to address disruptive behavior at every level.Refuse to accept violent behavior by imposing serious and predictable consequences on such behavior.Increase fiscal responsibility and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe Board of Education is directing DCPS to implement the Blueprint requirements within the required timelines. However, sufficient funding to meet these mandated requirements is not being provided by the State of Maryland. Lack of adequate funding will require hard, but informed choices over the next several years. Unless increased funding is provided or implementation deadlines are modified, it may impossible to meet Blueprint requirements going forward.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have worked constructively with all individuals and groups who have the success of our students as their goal. For example, Mike Diaz (2023-24 Board President, 2022-23 Vice President) and I (2022-23 President, 2023-24 Vice President) have markedly different political views, but we have worked extremely well together to generate the constructive change needed for our children to succeed. Actions of the Board under our leadership over the past two years have resulted in the following accomplishments:\nStudent Achievement: The Board is now monitoring student achievement using structured reports prepared by the DCPS Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessments. As a result, we now have reliable data demonstrating that our students' test scores are improving somewhat is some areas.Kindergarten Readiness: Importantly, 42.4% of students enrolled in pre-kindergarten programs demonstrate readiness for kindergarten. Overall Kindergarten readiness has improved with 39% of students demonstrating readiness in Fall of SY2023-2024 (versus 32% in SY2022-2023 and 29% in SY2021-2022).Programs to Address Disruptive Behavior: This year, the Board has finally implemented a structured alternative education program that includes both academic and social/emotional components (with both an on-campus and an off-campus high school program) that is showing measurable results. Functional Family Therapy delivered in the student's home is an important component of this program. A request for proposals to develop and implement similar on-campus programs at the elementary and middle school levels has been posted.Increased Fiscal Responsibility and Accountability: Over the past two years, the Board President and Vice President have initiated increased scrutiny of budget development and detailed justifications of spending requests. The Board now requires that concrete performance and outcome measures be specified for funded programs and for contracts with external organizations. In preparation for SY 2024-25, we are going back to the basics with our budget. Every dollar is being scrutinized, including costs of maintenance, function, administration and teachers. Costs have often been carried over from year-to-year without evaluation.School Safety: School safety has been improved demonstrably. We have supplied all of our secondary schools with weapons detection systems and installed fences around many of our schools. In addition, the board now refuses to accept violent behavior and is willing to impose serious and predictable consequences for violent behavior.Website Redesign: Comments from users indicated that the previous DCPS website failed to provide important information, was difficult to navigate, and lacked effective mechanisms for getting information out to the community. The Board directed DCPS to develop a new website that would incorporate an integrated communication system to address these deficiencies. After much discussion and review, the new website and communication system were installed and became operational this year.Increased Communication with the County Council:The board president and vice president have met regularly with the president and vice president of the County Council to foster an understanding of DCPS needs and programs and to address wider areas of concern, such as juvenile justice challenges.\nMIKE DIAZMike Diaz is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Diaz is the current Board of Education president.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe board (5 elected individuals), are intensely focused on the areas described above. The Board members working with the superintendent are highly focused on retention and accountability within the system. As with any large company, or in our case school district, change doesn't occur over night and neither do results. I feel we are moving rapidly in the right direction.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nOur job as the duly elected members to the school district is to govern the district and work with the superintendent. He manages the district and, specifically, the Blueprint requirements. The county government provides us the Maintenance of Effort funding to which we and the superintendent account for in the budget. This funding accounts for roughly 20% of the DCPS budget.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI was elected in 2020 and, shortly after taking office, the pandemic occurred, slowing everything down. That being said, I ran on safety and security and accountability as my main focus. Since then we added a layered security apparatus that involves weapon detection systems, security camera upgrades, security vestibules, etc. We had the superintendent hire a director of security and an assistant superintendent to focus on safety and accountability directly in the schools.\nAlternative Education at the secondary level was something I wanted to ensure was available to the district when these students displayed undesirable behaviors and were, in most cases, sent home or suspended long term. Although DCPS by law still has to provide them educational services, many students never completed those tasks and were in the community being unaccountable. Making the investment in alternative education now ensures that there is a program in place in each high school for students that are experiencing difficulty in their normal setting.\nStudents that are placed on long term suspension are asked to participate in the off-campus alternative education program in Woolford and are there for an average of 44 days. This is in collaboration with the student and the parents. Many of the students are also given the opportunity to participate in the Functional Family Therapy program that is also offered as an intensive in-home wrap-around service.\nI can't think of a better example of the term \"equity\" than this. Providing structural, long-term, evidenced-based services to our most at risk populations.\nThis Board also approved a three year agreement with the educators, increasing their compensation to meet the Blueprint standards.\nThe overall goal is to provide the community the best education possible. DCPS is currently 23 out of 24 in Maryland, something the acting superintendent reminds us of frequently. We didn't get here overnight. I feel more confident that we are charging ahead with the mentality of accountability at all levels. This approach will shape the management and leadership culture in the district and will have a direct effect in the learning process.\nBRANDY DAWSON CUMBERLANDBrandy Dawson Cumberland is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nA fresh perspective as a parent and invested community member, without a private agenda. I have studied and implemented quality initiative projects throughout my doctoral studies. I am serious about safe, evidence-based and data-driven solutions while remembering the uniqueness and diversity of our large school district. Additionally, as a mental health professional, I aim to serve our community, and the future of our community is our children.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nGoals must prioritize safety, transparency, learning, retaining quality educators and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nWhile the Blueprint has been passed at the state level, several districts are in a similar situation to Dorchester. We must continue working with local and state legislators to advocate for resource allocation to allow for implementation.\nCHRIS WEEDLETONChris Wheedleton is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. He is currently serving as District 5 board member.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe board and district leadership established and aligned on a strategic plan last year that lays out clear goals for improvement and growth. Those goals were translated into scorecards and metrics in every area of the strategic plan including academic success, school/family/community partnerships, school safety & climate, high quality workforce and operational efficiency. We have shifted the monthly board meetings to put student outcomes and deliverables in each area at the forefront of what we focus on and post the outcomes on the DCPS website after every meeting to ensure transparency and clarity for all community stakeholders. Continuous improvement in every one of those areas is what the district needs to and is working towards. Check out the plan at: https://www.dcps.k12.md.us/o/dcps/page/parents\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nIn an honest and open way. That includes how we are working to understand and stay compliant with the guidelines that have been and continue to be laid out from the state, which we are currently doing through our Blueprint coordinator, Dr. Boyd. It also includes sharing with all stakeholders what is working and not working for our District and community. There are multiple elements of Blueprint that need to be refined in order for it to help support the unique needs of Dorchester County. The board and superintendent continue to share those with state and local officials so that they understand, from the educator's perspective, what the implementation looks like on the ground. Working together to understand and try to improve what is needed for our county is important. There are positive aspects that have brought resources in the area of workforce development and career planning for students, as well as areas like early childhood that have yet to be structured in ways that work in Dorchester County.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have enjoyed the work of the board and appreciate the feedback I have received that community members have seen my approach as organized and thoughtful to the questions and work that comes before the Board for consideration and action. I am proud to have added value in helping to develop and steer the publicly available Data Dashboard and the process behind it, clearer connections to the business community, and a reinstated CASE Agricultural program at DCTC to ensure that exposure to pathways to success in agriculture remain a viable part of the educational experience for students in our community. One clear goal ahead is the critical work of finding the best next leader of DCPS as part of the superintendent search process that we are currently going through, and I am honored to be helping to lead that process. I would be proud to represent the area of Dorchester County in District 5 that raised me.

    "content": "A rough road: Students see bad choice consequences in mock crash\n\n April 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARTY MADDEN mmadden@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 579\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A statewide initiative to curb road fatalities continues to send a sobering message to Maryland's newest drivers.What began nationwide decades ago as a lesson in the dangers of blending alcohol with driving now includes in its scenario the sad consequences of not wearing seatbelts or allowing diversions such as cellphones and conversations to take a driver's attention away from the road.\nPublic high schools in Calvert County have annually been the venue for mock crashes. This year three of the high schools participated in crash scenarios with the aid and supervision of emergency responders and police.\nLast week's mock crash at Northern High began with the pretend scenario of a 17-year-old male, hosting a party at his home, hearing the sound of a two-vehicle crash down the fog-shrouded road leading from the house.\n\"I know them, they were just at my house,\" he tells 911.\nAccording to the scenario a female driving a truck is ejected and is soon pronounced dead at the scene.\nA smaller vehicle involved in the crash was operated by a young male who only suffers bruises but is later deemed impaired by alcohol and marijuana. A front seat passenger was not wearing a seatbelt and crews must extricate her from the vehicle. A rear seat passenger is assessed as unhurt but traumatized.\n\"Driving is a responsibility,\" Christy Nizer, Maryland's motor vehicle administrator, told the large group of Northern High students gathered around a back parking lot at the Owings school. \"You need to give your full attention to driving.\"\nNizer warned students that Maryland roads aren't getting any safer with all the distractions adding to the mix of things that can go wrong while traveling.\n\"We lost 600 people in motor vehicle crashes,\" Nizer said of Maryland's 2023 death toll. The number represents a 6% increase from the 2022 total.\nMany high school juniors are starting the transition from holding a learner's permit to being licensed to drive in Maryland.\nNizer and two other speakers — Christy Bliss, director of training for the Chesapeake Region Safety Council, and Calvert County Sheriff Ricky Cox (R) — acknowledged during remarks prior to the mock crash that many celebrations, including proms, graduations and parties will be taking place.\n\"You are the one behind the wheel,\" Bliss said, adding that she wanted students to think about, \"what it means to be distracted.

    "content": "Two face off for District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education position\n\n May 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 2177\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Dorchester County Board of Education has three position on the ballot this year for Districts 1, 3 and 5. There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 3 will not appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The two candidates for the seat will appear on the ballot for the November general election.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the candidates competing for the District 3 seat to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity.\nCHRISTINE LAMONICA\nChristine LaMonica is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhy are you running?\nAs a parent and a dedicated member of public safety in Dorchester County, I am motivated to address safety concerns in our schools as well advocate for all students to have access to a quality education. As a community we continue to face evolving challenges, these challenges look different in each district. I am prepared to serve our community's public schools and assist in ensuring that the school districts are responsive to these challenges and receptive to the values and priorities of its community members.\nIn addition, as a prospective board member, it is my desire for our children and educators to be set up for success. I plan to use my commitment to public service and my personal and professional experiences to assist with solutions, ideas, and decisions. I firmly believe it is time for Dorchester County Public Schools to start rising to the top and to exceed expectations.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a prospective member of the Board of Education, I bring a commitment to fostering positive change and ensuring that every student receives the best possible education in a safe environment.\nI bring a true passion for advocacy for our students, families, and educators to ensure that their voices are heard, and their needs are met within our educational system. This will include advocating for resources for all schools regardless of their socioeconomic status or location, as I believe in the power of inclusive education that celebrates diversity and promotes a sense of belonging for every student.\nAs a board member I would promote transparency and collaboration in decision making. I am looking forward to visiting the schools and listening to the needs of each district, I believe that is paramount in understanding the culture of our schools. I recognize that to make progress, the Board functions best when the members work together towards common goals with open communication and respect.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nWe have many important issues, all requiring attention. However, as a parent with children in the school system, and as a public safety professional in Dorchester County, I personally believe we need to start our new school year off creating a safer school environment for everyone. Safe schools foster successful learning. This goes beyond more school resource officers and weapon detection systems. This includes addressing the root cause of violence and insecurity in our community by advocating for safe schools with a holistic approach that addresses social, emotional and environmental factors that impact our students.\nThis issue as well as many others require commitment, collaboration (one of my favorite words) and action to ensure our schools are nurturing and safe environments where our students can thrive for success. We can achieve this with more wraparound services and consistency in planning and implementing.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward? How do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nI am going to combine this question along with the question regarding the Blueprint. Overall, the board and district should work together towards the common goal of student safety, success in learning, and wellness for all students first and foremost, the Blueprint hopefully being a roadmap to help us meet certain objectives.\nAs a candidate and community member I see the Blueprint as a \"challenge,\" and one that has the potential to bring good to our schools, albeit nothing is perfect or easy. As a candidate I think the county and the board are addressing the issues of funding and staffing regarding the requirements of the Blueprint and the future of our education system the best they can right now with the resources available to them. The county and the board are going to have to be creative and resilient with the challenges ahead. We aren't alone or singled out in Dorchester County. Larger counties are facing challenges also. They may have more resources to pull from, but larger populations to serve. We all have our specific barriers to overcome. We see this not only in the education system, but in many public service arenas.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nThese numbers tell me that we have work to do. We need those numbers to rise, not only because they are statistics to boast about, but because we want our young students to do well so they can be successful learners. Our educators and support staff that I personally have worked alongside are giving what they can and then some. There is no simple solution, however this is where I think the Blueprint has some promise to help us navigate through some of these difficulties. It just has pieces and parts that are difficult for Dorchester County to achieve for many reasons.\nThe district has its work cut out for it, and so does the board. But as a community, we also have work to do. It takes a village. We need to come together with transparency and a willingness to listen without any personal agendas. As a candidate, I am ready to work with other board members, community leaders and stakeholders to move us forward.\nSUSAN MORGAN\nSusan Morgan is running for the District 3 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Morgan is the current Board of Education vice president.\nWhy are you running?\nDriving change has not been easy. More work is needed to bring about the changes that our children need and deserve. DCPS still faces tremendous challenges.\nDCPS students score next-to-last in the State on every academic measure.\nIncoming students lack social, emotional and academic readiness.\nChronic absenteeism remains a significant impediment to achievement.\nDisruptive behavior too often impedes learning and threatens student and teacher safety.\nBudget reductions will require hard, but informed choices over the next several years.\nWithout a strong, improved school system, our community will never attract the young families and businesses that are that are critical to future success.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nMy top priority going forward is to raise the academic performance of all students in every school, with a particular focus on reading and math. The Board is now monitoring student achievement using structured reports prepared by the DCPS Director of Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessments. As a result, we now have reliable data demonstrating that our students' test scores are improving somewhat is some areas. However, unacceptably large percentages of our students in every grade score below grade level in reading and math. Chronic absenteeism remains a significant impediment to achievement. More effective interventions are needed that dedicate time EVERY DAY to reading and math.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nRaise the academic performance of all students in every school, with a particular focus on reading and math.\nMake kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.\nReduce chronic absenteeism.\nImplement an effective alternative education program to address disruptive behavior at every level.\nRefuse to accept violent behavior by imposing serious and predictable consequences on such behavior.\nIncrease fiscal responsibility and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe Board of Education is directing DCPS to implement the Blueprint requirements within the required timelines. However, sufficient funding to meet these mandated requirements is not being provided by the State of Maryland. Lack of adequate funding will require hard, but informed choices over the next several years. Unless increased funding is provided or implementation deadlines are modified, it may impossible to meet Blueprint requirements going forward.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nImportantly, 42.4% of students enrolled in pre-kindergarten programs demonstrate readiness for kindergarten. Overall Kindergarten readiness has improved with 39% of students demonstrating readiness in Fall of SY2023-2024 (versus 32% in SY2022-2023 and 29% in SY2021-2022) We need to make kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have worked constructively with all individuals and groups who have the success of our students as their goal. For example, Mike Diaz (2023-24 Board President, 2022-23 Vice President) and I (2022-23 President, 2023-24 Vice President) have markedly different political views, but we have worked extremely well together to generate the constructive change needed for our children to succeed. Actions of the Board under our leadership over the past two years have resulted in the following accomplishments:\nStudent Achievement.Progress – The Board is now monitoring student achievement using structured reports prepared by the DCPS Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessments. As a result, we now have reliable data demonstrating that our students' test scores are improving somewhat is some areas.Priority – Unacceptably large percentages of our students in every grade score below grade level in reading and math. Chronic absenteeism remains a significant impediment to achievement. More effective interventions are needed.Kindergarten Readiness.Progress – Importantly, 42.4% of students enrolled in pre-kindergarten programs demonstrate readiness for kindergarten. Overall Kindergarten readiness has improved with 39% of students demonstrating readiness in Fall of SY2023-2024 (versus 32% in SY2022-2023 and 29% in SY2021-2022).Priority – We need to make kindergarten readiness programs available for all students.Programs to Address Disruptive Behavior.Progress – This year, the Board has finally implemented a structured alternative education program that includes both academic and social/emotional components (with both an on-campus and an off-campus high school program) that is showing measurable results. Functional Family Therapy delivered in the student's home is an important component of this program. A request for proposals to develop and implement similar on-campus programs at the elementary and middle school levels has been posted.Priority – Implementation of these intervention programs is critical to ensuring students' academic progress and behavioral control. These programs must be flexible enough to address individual student needs, and must be based on a written Functional Behavioral Assessment, supported by a concrete, individualized Behavioral Intervention Plan.Increased Fiscal Responsibility and Accountability.Progress – Over the past two years, the Board President and Vice President have initiated increased scrutiny of budget development and detailed justifications of spending requests. The Board now requires that concrete performance and outcome measures be specified for funded programs and for contracts with external organizations. In preparation for SY 2024-25, we are going back to the basics with our budget. Every dollar is being scrutinized, including costs of maintenance, function, administration and teachers. Costs have often been carried over from year-to-year without evaluation.Priority – The practice of continuing programs without evaluation must stop, and programs that cannot demonstrate effectiveness must be eliminated in favor of programs that can. Budget reductions will require hard, but informed choices going forward.School Safety.Progress – School safety has been improved demonstrably. We have supplied all of our secondary schools with weapons detection systems and installed fences around many of our schools. In addition, the board now refuses to accept violent behavior and is willing to impose serious and predictable consequences for violent behavior.Priority – Violent students may be offered appropriate voluntary educational programs outside DCPS, but violence can not be accepted on any DCPS campus. Consequences for violent behavior must continue to be clear and consistently enforced.Website Redesign.Progress – Comments from users indicated that the previous DCPS website failed to provide important information, was difficult to navigate, and lacked effective mechanisms for getting information out to the community. The Board directed DCPS to develop a new website that would incorporate an integrated communication system to address these deficiencies. After much discussion and review, the new website and communication system were installed and became operational this year.Priority – The website must be maintained and updated in a timely and user-friendly manner.Increased Communication with the County Council.Progress – The board president and vice president have met regularly with the president and vice president of the County Council to foster an understanding of DCPS needs and programs and to address wider areas of concern, such as juvenile justice challenges.Priority – Increased communication with the County Council must be maintained and strengthened. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Three candidates compete for District 5 Dorchester Board of Education seat\n\n May 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Dorchester County Board of Education has three position on the ballot this year for Districts 1, 3 and 5. There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 5 will appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election in November.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the candidates competing for the District 5 seat to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity.\nCHRIS WEEDLETON\nChris Wheedleton is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. He is currently serving as District 5 board member.\nWhy are you running?\nI was honored to be appointed last year by the County Council to represent District 5, based on the experiences and skills that I have built working in education and workforce development innovations across the country over the last several decades. I have enjoyed the process of collaborating with the board and community stakeholders to align our resources and find solutions to improve opportunities and outcomes for our students, educators and schools. I feel like I have added value and see the opportunity to help make further improvements. I would like to continue that work for a full term.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThere are many needs and challenges that we face as a community and school district. Among the most important issues currently is the need to have a clear sense for where we are and where we need to go as a school system, and a consistent culture across the system and in each school for accountability and working together to find the best solutions. The current process for finding the best next leader for DCPS is an important part of that, and the board is starting with direct engagement with the community to get the voice of all stakeholders as part of this process. I believe that having a culture that brings all resources that we have as a collective community to help create the best conditions for our students to find success, is among the most important issues we face right now and into the future.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe board and district leadership established and aligned on a strategic plan last year that lays out clear goals for improvement and growth. Those goals were translated into scorecards and metrics in every area of the strategic plan including academic success, school/family/community partnerships, school safety & climate, high quality workforce and operational efficiency. We have shifted the monthly board meetings to put student outcomes and deliverables in each area at the forefront of what we focus on and post the outcomes on the DCPS website after every meeting to ensure transparency and clarity for all community stakeholders. Continuous improvement in every one of those areas is what the district needs to and is working towards. Check out the plan at: https://www.dcps.k12.md.us/o/dcps/page/parents\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nIn an honest and open way. That includes how we are working to understand and stay compliant with the guidelines that have been and continue to be laid out from the state, which we are currently doing through our Blueprint coordinator, Dr. Boyd. It also includes sharing with all stakeholders what is working and not working for our District and community. There are multiple elements of Blueprint that need to be refined in order for it to help support the unique needs of Dorchester County. The board and superintendent continue to share those with state and local officials so that they understand, from the educator's perspective, what the implementation looks like on the ground. Working together to understand and try to improve what is needed for our county is important. There are positive aspects that have brought resources in the area of workforce development and career planning for students, as well as areas like early childhood that have yet to be structured in ways that work in Dorchester County.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nThere are so many positive improvements happening across our community, and the collective impact of community partners is starting show real results, in concert with the leadership of DCPS. It is no accident that the timing of these improvements comes in the second year of a 10 year comprehensive plan as part of the Campaign for Grade-Level Reading that was started in Dorchester County by a wide range of community partners. This has included nonprofits, business partners and action agencies including Moving Dorchester Forward, the Health Department, the Chamber of Commerce, the library system, the YMCA, Boys & Girls Clubs and United Way. Much of this was started through the leadership of the John & Janice Wyatt Foundation. DCPS is a key leader in this effort through the Early Childhood Advisory Council. The more that we can bring EVERYONE together in this collective effort, the more we will see continued progress. Learn more at: https://www.dorchestercglr.com/\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI have enjoyed the work of the board and appreciate the feedback I have received that community members have seen my approach as organized and thoughtful to the questions and work that comes before the Board for consideration and action. I am proud to have added value in helping to develop and steer the publicly available Data Dashboard and the process behind it, clearer connections to the business community, and a reinstated CASE Agricultural program at DCTC to ensure that exposure to pathways to success in agriculture remain a viable part of the educational experience for students in our community. One clear goal ahead is the critical work of finding the best next leader of DCPS as part of the superintendent search process that we are currently going through, and I am honored to be helping to lead that process. I would be proud to represent the area of Dorchester County in District 5 that raised me. I welcome anyone who wants to learn more to check out my website at: https://skillsgap.org/welcome\nMIKE HARTFORD\nMike Hartford is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhy are you running?\nMy main focus is keeping our current schools in place. The last few years have been challenging for the current students, board and parents. We need to be sure parents have a true say in what is happening and a place to have their questions answered. I'm running to bring transparency to the current issues at hand and to keep the parents well informed in not only our district, but our county. Its time the younger generation stands up and starts making the changes they wish to see.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nFirst-hand knowledge from a parent standpoint on current issues. Outside perspective, from not only a parental standpoint, but from a business standpoint. As a small business owner I feel I have the tools necessary to communicate issues effectively and provide reasonable solutions when problems do arise.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe infrastructure of certain schools. We need to explore all options that work for the parents, not just the budget. We have schools that have been standing in low-lying areas creating common problems that if fixed, could potentially save the small communities around them. These communities make our county great, if we remove the school(s), we not only face logistical nightmares for parents, grandparents and siblings. We need reasonable solutions that the parents of the students who attend the schools can come to an agreement on.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nWe need to focus more on our local needs and suggestions, rather than what the state suggests. Our county is run by the students and the parents. The current board needs to be aware of that. It is about the kids, always.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nMaryland's Blueprint itself is a great concept. We need to adapt to these guidelines and utilize the tools and knowledge we have of our local community to expand the idea further. For Instance, teacher incentives, pay raises and teacher appreciation should be at the forefront of our focus. These are the people who guide the students in the right direction. We need to attract the best talent so we can provide the children the best education they can get. Our country's future depends on it.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nWhile trending in the right direction, we need to keep the momentum. Providing parents of toddlers and childcare workers educational supplies and online classes to further their skills could potentially be beneficial. The parents/daycare providers could use these supplies/skills to ensure our young children are mentally, physically and emotionally ready for their big transition. The current pk-3 option we are bringing into the 2024-2025 school year is a great idea, but at what expense?\nJEROME HARRIS\nJerome Harris is running for the District 5 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.

Truly it takes a village. I want to be able to recognize the people in the village that helped us do the jobs that we can do. We can't do it alone, isolated, as a school district,\" said TCSP Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi during her opeing remarks. \"We are super excited to shine a light on those community partners that helped us. Each school selects one community partner that has helped them throughout the year. As I like to say it is a handshake, not a handout.\"\nThe TCPS dance program performed by Beyond the Steps stole the show and got big applause for their energetic performance to Pharrell Williams' \"Happy.\" Afterwards, awards were presented to community partners.\nEach school in the district chose one partner to uplift.\nTalbot County Public School District chose the Talbot County Public Library to honor.\n\"We selected them because we always come up with ideas and the people from the library are like sure we will do it. Like for example popsicles in the park. Anything we want to do, they are like, 'Call us and we will help out,'\" Pepukayi said.\nShe also made sure to \"Give a super shout out to the Talbot County Education Foundation. They are the group that supports our teachers in the classroom when they have ideas. They help fund those innovative ideas and projects that teachers want to do.\"\nDr. Lisa Devaric, principal of Easton Elementary School, said, \"We are recognizing Rack Room Shoes. They have a program where people buy shoes and a percentage goes into a shoe fund for our school. We are at about 78% free and reduced meals. So close to eight out of ten of our students are living at or below the line of poverty line.\"\nShe said that community school program manager Katie Fox knows what style, color and size the students need and uses the funds to buy shoes for them.\n\"We want to provide more than academics. We want to improve the quality of life for our students looking at mental health, access to nutritional foods, wraparound care,\" Devaric said.\nDebbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools, introduced the schools and their partners one by one.\nFirst was Kari Clow, principal of Chapel District Elementary School, who chose Second Chance Thrift Shop. Easton Middle School chose Foundation of Hope. Easton High School chose Harbor Freight Tools. St. Michaels Middle High School chose Donnie and Shelley Gowe. St. Michaels Elementary chose the St. Michaels Fire Department.\nTilghman Elementary chose Tilghman Methodist Church. White Marsh Elementary chose Mamma Maria's and the Coffee Trappe. TCPS Internship Program chose iFrog Marketing Solutions. The Early Learning Department and the Judy Center chose Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers.\nThe closing remarks were made by Emily Jackson, president of the Talbot County Board of Education.\n\"I am so blown away by what I have seen today. Our community is truly amazing. Thank you all for everything you do every day. Your unwavering support is the backbone of our schools, and you empower us to create meaningful experiences for our students,\" Jackson said.\nShe thanked the culinary arts students, Linda Brown and Joseph Candel for making breakfast. She also thanked the TCPS Education Foundation for sponsoring the whole event.\n\"It is about recognizing the spirit of collaboration and the unity that defines us as a community. Whether it is volunteering your time, providing resources or lending your expertise each of you and your contributions makes a real difference in the lives of our students,\" Jackson said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Three vie for District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat\n\n May 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 3676\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Dorchester County Board of Education has three position on the ballot this year for Districts 1, 3 and 5. There are currently eight candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Dorchester County Public Schools.Candidates in Districts 1 will appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election in November.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the candidates competing for the District 1 seat to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity.\nBRANDY DAWSON CUMBERLAND\nBrandy Dawson Cumberland is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhy are you running?\nI was approached about becoming a candidate after the community became concerned about the lack of transparency when several schools were proposed to be shut down. As a life-long resident of my district, and with four children of my own, I was passionate about saving our schools, especially our rural schools.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nA fresh perspective as a parent and invested community member, without a private agenda. I have studied and implemented quality initiative projects throughout my doctoral studies. I am serious about safe, evidence-based and data-driven solutions while remembering the uniqueness and diversity of our large school district. Additionally, as a mental health professional, I aim to serve our community, and the future of our community is our children.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nProviding the fundamentals essential for students is the most important issue in DCPS. Teachers and students need safe classrooms. We must engage those surrounding our students, in the family and community, and address local and state policies to prioritize each individual's safety in a DCPS building and bus.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nGoals must prioritize safety, transparency, learning, retaining quality educators and accountability.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nWhile the Blueprint has been passed at the state level, several districts are in a similar situation to Dorchester. We must continue working with local and state legislators to advocate for resource allocation to allow for implementation.\nAccording to DCPS data, Kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nImprovement in kindergarten readiness is positive for Dorchester County and is approaching the Maryland average. Going forward the district must continue to utilize evidence-based practice within the curriculum with allotment for additional resources as needed.\nMIKE DIAZ\nMike Diaz is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat. Diaz is the current Board of Education president.\nWhy are you running?\nI'm running for re-election to continue the work that I started in my first term, which will be outlined in the following responses.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nIn my opinion, the most important issues facing DCPS are as follows and not in order of importance: safety and security, retention and recruitment of highly qualified teachers, alternative education and an intensive reading program at the elementary level.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nThe board (5 elected individuals), are intensely focused on the areas described above. The Board members working with the superintendent are highly focused on retention and accountability within the system. As with any large company, or in our case school district, change doesn't occur over night and neither do results. I feel we are moving rapidly in the right direction.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nOur job as the duly elected members to the school district is to govern the district and work with the superintendent. He manages the district and, specifically, the Blueprint requirements. The county government provides us the Maintenance of Effort funding to which we and the superintendent account for in the budget. This funding accounts for roughly 20% of the DCPS budget.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nThe district has been intensely focused on primary education. Although there are promising gains in this area, we have a long way to go. There are many reasons for the primary education gap. Many children, especially in our Title I schools, show up already far behind the standard and become frustrated in the classroom. Many times this results in emotional outbursts which requires them to be removed from that setting or sent home. This is a failing strategy and only widens the learning gap. As we already have alternative education for special education students and high school students, we asked the district to submit RFP's for elementary education. These programs will keep children in school learning and, over time, produce structural change.\nAs a board member, what has been your biggest accomplishment OR what has been the board's biggest accomplishment since you've been on it? What is one goal still ahead?\nI was elected in 2020 and, shortly after taking office, the pandemic occurred, slowing everything down. That being said, I ran on safety and security and accountability as my main focus. Since then we added a layered security apparatus that involves weapon detection systems, security camera upgrades, security vestibules, etc. We had the superintendent hire a director of security and an assistant superintendent to focus on safety and accountability directly in the schools.\nAlternative Education at the secondary level was something I wanted to ensure was available to the district when these students displayed undesirable behaviors and were, in most cases, sent home or suspended long term. Although DCPS by law still has to provide them educational services, many students never completed those tasks and were in the community being unaccountable. Making the investment in alternative education now ensures that there is a program in place in each high school for students that are experiencing difficulty in their normal setting.\nStudents that are placed on long term suspension are asked to participate in the off-campus alternative education program in Woolford and are there for an average of 44 days. This is in collaboration with the student and the parents. Many of the students are also given the opportunity to participate in the Functional Family Therapy program that is also offered as an intensive in-home wrap-around service.\nI can't think of a better example of the term \"equity\" than this. Providing structural, long-term, evidenced-based services to our most at risk populations.\nThis Board also approved a three year agreement with the educators, increasing their compensation to meet the Blueprint standards.\nThe overall goal is to provide the community the best education possible. DCPS is currently 23 out of 24 in Maryland, something the acting superintendent reminds us of frequently. We didn't get here overnight. I feel more confident that we are charging ahead with the mentality of accountability at all levels. This approach will shape the management and leadership culture in the district and will have a direct effect in the learning process.\nLastly, it's been a difficult year for this board, losing two of it's members in less than a year. I would like to take the opportunity to remember the late Board President Mrs. Laura Layton and Board member Dr. Theresa Stafford. Both of these women were invaluable assets to the district and the communities they served. We will miss them.\nLUCAS THORPE\nLucas Thorpe is running for the District 1 Dorchester County Board of Education seat.\nWhy are you running?\nIn response to a recent inquiry about my motivation for running, I delved into the decisions made by the current Board of Education. My concern stems from a belief that, at times, our representatives may not prioritize the best interests of students. To illustrate this, I scrutinized recent board decisions, and one instance that stood out was the vote on the Mid Shore Community Mediation Center contract on Sept. 21, 2023, resulting in a narrow 3-2 defeat.\nThe focal point of this concern lies in the decision-making process surrounding the Mid Shore Community Mediation Center contract, an annual renewal that faced a tight vote on Sept. 21, 2023, resulting in a narrow 3-2 defeat. The contract, valued at $56,000, is contingent upon Title IV grant funding. This funding source underscores the significance of the contract, as its forfeiture could potentially impact the availability of funds allocated for critical student-oriented initiatives. However, the dynamics of the decision-making process raised eyebrows, particularly due to a remark made by the now current Board President during deliberations, to quote, \"Mr. Diaz doesn't understand why Mid Shore Community Mediation Center goes to SDS when they do not have any conflict issues\".\nThe comment, expressing a lack of understanding about why Mid Shore Community Mediation Center engages with schools that purportedly do not have conflict issues, is not merely a casual observation. At its core, it reveals a potential blind spot in comprehending the nuanced dynamics of student and school interactions. Schools, despite appearing conflict-free on the surface, often grapple with intricate challenges that may not be immediately apparent.\nMid Shore Community Mediation Center or MSCMC, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, operates with the mission of \"building stronger, safer communities through education and collaborative processes that prevent and respond to conflict and increase access to justice.\" The organization initiated a pilot program at Maces Lane Middle School in 2011 and expanded to include Cambridge-South Dorchester High School, North Dorchester Middle School, and North Dorchester High School in 2013. MSCMC offers a range of mediation services, including staff/staff, staff/student, student/student, attendance mediation, community conferencing, conflict management workshops, restorative practices, and more.\nSince piloting at MLMS in 2011, MSCMC has received over 3,200 requests for service, conducted 1,300+ mediation sessions, and maintained an overall average agreement rate of 90%. Data from a school-based mediation evaluation survey conducted by MSCMC revealed that 89% of students believed mediation could have prevented their conflict from resulting in a fight. Additionally, 100% of adults agreed that mediation was a positive way to address concerns they had about a student.\nMid Shore Mediation's proposal for third-party intervention is not without merit. The organization has the potential to offer valuable assistance in various situations without compromising student success. This is a sentiment echoed by numerous school principals who emphasize the crucial role of Mid Shore Mediation's support. It's crucial to recognize that the contracted $56,000 is derived from Title IV grant funds specifically earmarked for this purpose. Therefore, if not utilized, these funds would be forfeited. This underscores the importance of a nuanced understanding of the funding structure and the potential impact on student-oriented initiatives.\nThis case exemplifies a concerning trend where the Board may inadvertently operate under personal agendas, or a presumption of superior knowledge compared to the seasoned leadership within our schools. These leaders are entrusted with the crucial task of operations and management, navigating the day-to-day challenges that shape the educational experience for our students.\nAs we reflect on decisions like these, it's essential to foster an environment where the expertise and insights of educators, administrators, and school leaders are considered integral to the decision-making process. The goal is to ensure that each choice aligns with the overarching mission of fostering an environment conducive to student success and well-being. In scrutinizing such decisions, we pave the way for a more inclusive and collaborative approach that genuinely prioritizes the best interests of our students and our community.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a candidate for the Board of Education, I bring a unique blend of experience, passion, and dedication to student success. Having previously served as a student member on the board, I understand the inner workings of the education system and the challenges that students face firsthand. This experience has equipped me with valuable insights into the needs and aspirations of our student population.\nIn addition to my board experience, my current work in the nonprofit sector serving Dorchester County Public Schools students has further deepened my understanding of the issues affecting our educational system. Through my role, I have developed innovative programs and initiatives aimed at supporting student growth and achievement.\nI am committed to fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and excellence within the board. My goal is to ensure that every decision made reflects a student-first mindset and contributes to the overall improvement of our educational system.\nFurthermore, I am dedicated to promoting innovation and equity in education. I will work tirelessly to advocate for resources and programs that empower all students to reach their full potential, regardless of their background or circumstances.\nOverall, I bring a wealth of experience, a steadfast dedication to student success and a strong commitment to collaborative leadership to the Board of Education.\nWhat is the most important issue that Dorchester County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most pressing issue facing Dorchester County Public Schools right now is the need for transparent leadership and enhanced engagement and collaboration within the community. Transparent leadership is essential to building trust and accountability within the school system. It involves open communication, honesty and a willingness to involve stakeholders in the decision making process. Without transparency, there is a risk of misinformation, confusion and a lack of confidence in the board's actions. Furthermore, engagement and collaboration are crucial for fostering a sense of community ownership and collective responsibility for student success. This includes actively seeking input from parents, students, teachers, and community members, and incorporating their feedback into decision-making processes.\nTo address this issue, the board needs to prioritize transparent leadership and engagement by:\nEstablishing clear channels of communication: The board should ensure that information regarding policies, decisions, and initiatives is readily accessible to all stakeholders through multiple communication channels, including online platforms, community meetings and newsletters.Soliciting feedback: The board should actively seek input from stakeholders on important issues facing the school system. This can be done through surveys, town hall meetings and advisory committees to ensure that diverse perspectives are considered in decision making.Collaborating with community partners: The board should foster partnerships with local organizations, businesses and community leaders to leverage resources and expertise in addressing challenges facing DCPS. By working together, we can develop innovative solutions and support initiatives that benefit all students.Prioritizing school safety: Ensuring the safety and well-being of students and staff is paramount. The board should implement evidence-based safety measures, such as mental health support services, crisis intervention training and threat assessment protocols, to create a secure learning environment for all.\nIn summary, transparent leadership and engagement are fundamental to addressing the most important issues facing DCPS. By prioritizing these principles and working collaboratively with stakeholders, the board can build trust, foster a sense of community ownership, and ultimately, improve outcomes for all students.\nWhat goals do the board And district need to be working toward?\nThe goals that the board and district need to be working toward are multifaceted and require a comprehensive approach to address the challenges facing Dorchester County Public Schools. First and foremost, we need to prioritize improving academic outcomes and student achievement. Currently, DCPS is ranked 23 out of 24 systems in the state of Maryland, which is unacceptable. We must work tirelessly to elevate our educational standards and ensure that every student receives a high-quality education that prepares them for success.\nTo achieve this goal, we need to focus on several key areas:\nLeadership and support: It's imperative that we put strong leaders in leadership positions within the district and empower them to lead effectively. This means providing them with the resources, training and support they need to succeed without micromanaging them. By fostering a culture of trust and collaboration, we can create an environment where innovation and excellence thrive.Parent and community involvement: We must actively engage parents and community leaders in the educational process by enlisting them to fill vital roles within the school system, including educational support personnel, mentors and volunteers. By forging strong partnerships with families and community stakeholders, we can create a supportive network that enhances student learning and success.Addressing chronic absenteeism: Chronic absenteeism is a significant issue in our county and requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders to combat. We need to mobilize parents, community leaders and school staff to ensure that every child attends school regularly and on time. This may involve implementing targeted interventions, providing support services to at-risk students and raising awareness about the importance of attendance.Discipline and behavioral remediation: Discipline issues are pervasive in our district, and we must take proactive steps to address them. This includes supporting our teachers and administrators in maintaining a safe and orderly learning environment, enforcing consistent disciplinary practices and providing access to behavioral remediation resources and supports. Additionally, we should explore partnerships with community organizations and law enforcement to enhance school safety and support positive behavior.College and career readiness: While graduation rates in our county hover around 80%, we need to shift our focus beyond simply graduating students and ensure that they are adequately prepared for college and careers. This requires continued investment in after school programming, career and technology education and additional supports to encourage student success beyond high school. By equipping students with the skills, knowledge and opportunities they need to thrive, we can set them on a path toward lifelong success.\nThe board and district need to prioritize academic excellence, foster parent and community involvement, address chronic absenteeism and discipline issues, and promote college and career readiness. By working collaboratively toward these goals, we can create a school system that provides every student with the tools and opportunities they need to achieve their full potential.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nTo effectively address this question, it's crucial to first understand the Kirwan Commission, also known as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. As a law passed in the Maryland State Legislature, my stance on the Blueprint is clear: I fully support its objectives and initiatives.\nNow, the conversation shifts to how our school system will implement and stay on track with what is outlined in the Blueprint.\nOne key aspect of the Blueprint that I strongly endorse is Pillar 2, which focuses on high quality and diverse teachers and leaders. This pillar mandates that local school systems implement new teacher ladders, including a minimum teacher salary of $60,000 by fiscal year 2026. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of partnering with Historically Black Colleges and Universities to increase and support the pipeline of diverse teachers and leaders. Increasing teacher pay is essential for Dorchester to remain competitive and attract top talent to our schools.\nHowever, it's important to note that while I fully support the Blueprint, it is not currently fully funded by the State of Maryland. Despite a budget surplus in fiscal year 2023, the state is projected to face a structural budget deficit of $761 million by fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2024, DCPS received $58,118,000 in direct state funding and $24,006,038 in funding from the county. Historically, our county commissioners have funded education locally at around 0.0-1.0% above the Maintenance of Effort, whereas neighboring Wicomico County funds at roughly 5.0-10.0% above the MOE. As leaders in the school system and the county council, it's imperative that we collaborate to find ways to fully fund initiatives and programming efforts locally.\nOne positive outcome of the Blueprint that has already manifested is the addition of positions like career coaches, who now cover all of our secondary schools. These positions play a vital role in supporting students' college and career readiness.\nMoving forward, we should advocate for better understanding of the Blueprint and seek additional supports for rural communities like Dorchester. By working together and prioritizing education funding, we can ensure that every student in our county receives the high-quality education they deserve.\nAccording to DCPS data, kindergarten readiness among Dorchester County kindergarteners is at 39% this school year compared to 32% the year before. What does this tell you about what the district is doing now and what it still needs to do?\nThe increase in kindergarten readiness from 32% to 39% is certainly a positive development, indicating that some measures implemented by the district are yielding results. However, it also highlights areas where further improvement is necessary.\nFirstly, the uptick in kindergarten readiness suggests that the district may be implementing effective early childhood education initiatives or interventions targeted at improving school readiness among young learners. These could include programs focused on pre-literacy skills, numeracy, social-emotional development and overall school readiness.\nHowever, the fact that kindergarten readiness remains below 50% indicates that there is still significant room for improvement. This underscores the need for continued investment in early childhood education programs and resources, as well as a comprehensive approach to addressing the factors that may contribute to lower readiness rates.\nTo build on this progress and further increase kindergarten readiness, the district may need to consider several strategies. This includes expanding access to high-quality pre-K, Judy Center and pre-k 3 programs, increasing parent and community engagement in early childhood education, providing professional development opportunities for early childhood educators and implementing evidence-based practices proven to enhance school readiness. Additionally, it's essential for the district to closely monitor and assess the effectiveness of its initiatives through data-driven decision making. By identifying areas of strength and areas for improvement, the district can refine its approaches and allocate resources more effectively to support the success of all students, starting from their earliest years of schooling.\nThis upward trend in kindergarten readiness is a testament to the dedicated efforts of our early childhood department within the central office. Their visionary leadership has charted a new course for the direction of early childhood education in Dorchester County, and I commend their commitment to ensuring that every child enters kindergarten ready to learn. With continued investment and support from the Board of Education, I am confident that our KRA data will continue to show significant improvements, setting our students on a path to long-term success. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We needed a new road to bring a loop around before we could start on the construction,\" Evans said. \"We would like to thank Stacey Seward and Dan Fox, who is not here, from Caroline County to help us get a community development block grant that helped us build this road. Justin Fair was the project manager at the state and Cindy Stone. And then Robyne Chaconas, who is the deputy director the Community Development Administration.\"\nThe excited crowd clapped.\n\"When we talk about this master plan, it didn't only take a village in the beginning to develop the plan. It is going to take a village to bring it to fruition. We are starting to see that by this first step,\" Evans said.\nThen on this windy cloudless day, 10 people joined Evans as he snipped the royal blue ribbon signifying the opening of the road around campus.\nGoing 100 feet and down a hill were five golden shovels by a patch of dirt. In the background was a backhoe and the space where residences will be built.\nBenedictine got $1.8 million in congressional directed funding to support these new spaces for residents who have developmental and intellectual disabilities and autism.\n\"Benedictine is launching its 'Transforming Lives' campaign to address the needs of its student demographic that has significantly changed since the existing residential spaces were built,\" a press release from Benedictine said. \"Over 80% of the student population that Benedictine now supports is living with more complicated forms of autism. The new residential wings will include suites equipped with multiple recreational and sensory areas, along with an updated dining area and state-of-the-art infirmary.\"\nEvans spoke while those assembled grabbed golden shovels.\n\"Where we stand now and what is behind me is the old convent for the sisters. As you know, our campus operates 24/7, 365. When we started this, one of the biggest obstacles was how are we going to update our facilities and not hamper what we do on a daily basis serving the students,\" Evans said.\n\"We could refine and develop a space that really does meet the needs of the student profile that we serve today. That is what is most important. The next is how do we pay for it?\"\nFunding for the school comes primarily from the state, Evans said.\n\"A lot of people stepped up beginning with Gov. Hogan's office and then Gov. Moore's office giving us capital. And then our entire congressional delegation, including Sens. Van Hollen and Cardin, Rep. Andy Harris,\" he said.\nThere was even more local delegation support that included state legislators — Sen. Stephen Hershey and Sen. Johnny Mautz, Del. Jeff Ghrist, Del. Chris Adams, Del. Steven Arentz and Del. Jay Jacobs, Evans said.\n\"They really went to bat for us with bond bill money and capital monies at the state. Because of our advocates in Annapolis, we were able to get $1.25 million in capital, which is huge,\" he said.\nBenedictine will start building the new facility in a few weeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There are currently six candidates running with a variety of experience and goals for Talbot Public Schools.Candidates in District 2 will appear on the ballot for the May 14 primary election. The top two vote-getters will move on to the general election. The Districts 5 and 6 candidates will not be on the ballot until November, since no more than two candidates are registered in those races.\nEach position will serve a four-year term beginning in Dec. 1, 2024, and ending in Dec.1, 2028.\nThe Star Democrat reached out to the eight candidates competing for the seats to ask questions about their campaigns.\nThe candidates' answers below have been edited for clarity and length. Extended versions of the candidates' Q&As can be found at stardem.com.\nCANDACE HENRY\nCandace Henry is running for the District 2 Board of Education seat. She is currently on the Board of Education.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nSeveral very important issues face Talbot County Public Schools. One key issue is the recruitment and retention of diverse teachers and administrators.\nAs a board, we should continue and enhance our efforts to create a welcoming and supportive work environment, offer competitive compensation, increase opportunities for high-quality professional development, prioritize work-life balance, and recognize the value of all educators.\nAnother important issue is the opportunity gap. To address the opportunity gap, it is important to continue our multi-faceted approach to advancing equity throughout TCPS. Examples include resource allocation, targeted support for underserved communities, access to challenging courses for all students, data-informed decision-making, community engagement, and recruiting diverse educators.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe implementation of the Blueprint involves careful planning, collaboration with stakeholders, and a focus on equity. Additionally, TCPS leadership should continue efforts to regularly communicate with our local community and stakeholders on the progress and updates related to implementation planning.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nEach year, the board and district meet to identify and align our goals with the district's strategic planning initiatives. The board and district should continue to work toward several overarching goals to effectively improve educational experiences and outcomes for all students.\nWe should continue to ensure that all students have equitable access to high-quality education, regardless of their background, socioeconomic status, race, or ability. This includes addressing disparities in resources, opportunities, and outcomes among student populations.\nThe board and district should continue to set ambitious goals that focus on improving student achievement, closing achievement gaps, increasing proficiency levels in core subjects, and preparing students for post-secondary education and/or career success.\nWhy are you running?\nI currently serve on the TCPS School Board, a position I've been proud to hold for the last 4 years. I am inspired by my personal experiences as a student in Talbot County Public Schools and am a proud alumna of Easton High School.\nI am also a mother of two TCPS students. My grandmother's legacy as a TCPS educator has instilled in me a profound passion for education, which has fueled my dedication to serving on the Board of Education.\nI witnessed my grandmother go above and beyond for her students and work tirelessly in our community to help others. Her work inspired and shaped the mother, advocate, wife, community leader, and professional that I am today.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nI bring over 20 years of advocacy experience and a deep commitment to public education to the Board of Education.\nRegarding my professional background, I am currently the director of the Disability Resource Center at Salisbury University, where I am responsible for the oversight and coordination of all operational, administrative, budgetary, personnel, outreach, and assessment activities for students with disabilities.\nAdditionally, I am an adjunct professor in the College of Health and Human Services, where I co-developed and teach in the university's first disability studies minor.\nData is showing a lack of kindergarten preparedness since the pandemic. What do you feel needs to be done to help young students catch up to pre-pandemic numbers?\nTCPS's commitment to engaging families as partners in their children's education has been critical to the goal of improving kindergarten preparedness. I am in support of expanding access to high-quality early childhood education programs, including pre-kindergarten and Head Start programs, especially for children from historically-excluded backgrounds.\nThese programs can provide a strong foundation for academic and social-emotional development before kindergarten. Additionally, extended learning opportunities, such as summer and afterschool programs, can also provide complimentary academic support and enrichment experiences for young students.\nWe should also continue to establish systems for ongoing data monitoring and assessment to track students' progress in kindergarten preparedness and adjust strategies as needed. Using data to identify areas of improvement and allocate resources strategically to support student success.\nOver the past decade, Talbot County elementary schools have seen a rise in Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language. What would you suggest or hope to do to better accommodate these students?\nI support TCPS's continued efforts to increase and strengthen support for our Hispanic and ELL students.\nTo better accommodate Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language in Talbot County elementary schools, it's essential to implement strategies that foster a supportive and inclusive learning environment while addressing student needs.\nSuch strategies include establishing strong partnerships with Hispanic families and community organizations, increasing outreach initiatives, incorporating culturally responsive teaching practices, and expanding support services to include topics related to academic support, cultural integration, and navigating the school system.\nCYNTHIA JURRIUS\nCynthia Jurrius is running for the District 6 Board of Education seat.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most significant issues facing Talbot County Public Schools are interrelated:\nStudent mastery of essential knowledge and skills.Retention, recruitment, and support of excellent teachers.Positive, safe, effective, inclusive school climate for all learners.Family and student engagement.\nAlthough test scores are not always indicative of a student's mastery of the subject matter, statewide and local assessments indicate that many of our TCPS students are not yet achieving grade level standards in essential subjects.\nOne of the most significant indicators for student success is an effective teacher, and, like the rest of the nation, Talbot faces significant teacher shortages.\nA positive, safe, effective, and inclusive school climate is fundamental for student success, as well as teacher retention. Finding innovative ways to engage families, including non English speakers, and students will support all aspects of student success.\nThe current board and superintendent are making progress toward addressing these issues despite many challenges, such as the learning gap caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through additional instructional support, expanding use of innovative community partnerships, strategic use of technology, targeted allocation of resources, and engaging all sectors of our community, I believe that working together we can accelerate progress in these areas.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling the Blueprint?\nThe board, Superintendent (Sharon) Pepukayi and team have a detailed plan for managing the Blueprint. I commend the transparency with which they are approaching this massive undertaking, providing regular reports on Blueprint progress for public review.\nThere are areas of the Blueprint that Talbot was already doing well and new areas that are now required to be addressed. There are many aspects of the Blueprint that are positive. However, the most challenging aspects of the Blueprint in Talbot are state mandates without sufficient funding.\nI would support continued efforts to address the state funding formula as it has been applied to Talbot County.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nAs stated in the TCPS FY 23 Annual Report, the board and superintendent have identified the following goals:\n\"Academic Equity and Achievement; increasing student mastery of grade level/course mathematics standards as measured by local assessments and MCAP measures.\nFostering an Engaging Environment; create and maintain a supportive environment that engages all students and staff.\nHiring and Retaining Highly Qualified and Diverse Staff. Recruit, hire, retain, and promote highly qualified and diverse staff.\"\nI support these goals — innovative, collaborative solutions are needed to accomplish the goals.\nWhy are you running?\nOur public schools play a pivotal role in shaping our community's future, and we need community members on our board who can help move Talbot County Public Schools forward to excellence.\nI serve to make a difference, I care about kids, and I have skills and experience to contribute. I would listen to all perspectives and value the richness in diversity of opinion.\nI am a natural collaborator, skilled at helping people work together to find solutions to challenging community problems. I am also willing to speak up and ask tough questions when necessary.\nI want to ensure that our Talbot Board of Education continues to function effectively and that the polarization that has infected many school districts stays out of our community. We have many strengths on which to build, and together we can solve any challenge.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nAs a seasoned community leader and mediator, I am committed to fostering an inclusive environment where all perspectives are heard, valued, and considered.\nThrough my community involvement; career as an attorney, community mediator, former director of a local nonprofit; and in my current role, I have honed the skills necessary to navigate complex community challenges.\nAs director of youth and family services for Mid Shore Community Mediation, and later as executive director, I launched the implementation of school-based programs focused on conflict resolution, leveraging limited resources for successful outcomes for students.\nI thrive on the challenge of collaborating with diverse stakeholders to uncover innovative solutions that benefit all parties involved. As the parent of three TCPS graduates, I understand the importance of advocating for policies and initiatives that prioritize the well-being and academic success of every student.\nAs a family member of educators and school administrators, I bring a multifaceted understanding of the educational landscape. We have many good things to celebrate in the Talbot County Public Schools — a great foundation of caring and skilled teachers, experienced administrators, an effective Board, and fantastic kids.\nI am dedicated to listening, collaborating, and working hard to ensure that our schools continue to evolve and thrive for the benefit of our entire community.\nData is showing a lack of kindergarten preparedness since the pandemic. What do you feel needs to be done to help young students catch up to pre-pandemic numbers?\nTCPS is currently implementing aspects of the Blueprint that provide for expanded pre-K, to support improved kindergarten readiness in the future.\nAdditionally, these students are now moving through the elementary grades, and students at other grade levels also have a pandemic learning gap. The existence of the gap needs to be recognized and addressed at all grade levels.\nAt the elementary, middle school, and high school levels, additional math coaches, use of differentiated self-paced technology, and additional instructional aides could be beneficial, including bi-lingual math and language coaches.\nIt is essential to meet students where they are, so that students who need support are not left behind, and those who are ready to excel have that opportunity.\nOver the past decade, Talbot County elementary schools have seen a rise in Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language. What would you suggest or hope to do to better accommodate these students?\nProviding an inclusive environment that supports all learners is important at all grade levels, and students who are not yet proficient in English come into TCPS at all grade levels.\nIt is essential for students at all grade levels to receive support to achieve English language proficiency, as well as support in other subject areas. The types of support for young learners, who are emerging readers, may differ from those for older students.\nThere is considerable research available about working with emerging language learners at all grade levels, and as a Board member, I would look for the best evidenced-based approaches.\nIn addition to providing additional bi-lingual instructional aides in classrooms, math and language coaching, and other direct supports for ESOL students, working with community organizations and community partners to engage these students and their families could be beneficial.\nANNA HOWIE\nAnna Howie is running for the District 5 Board of Education seat. She currently serves on the Talbot County Board of Education.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now is providing exceptional education opportunities for all students while being fiscally responsible.\nCurrently, the curriculum coordinating committee has brought high quality resources to the board for approval in the areas of reading and mathematics. These resources are paid for through educational grants.\nUtilizing grants is a responsible way of ensuring that we are providing our students with high quality instructional materials while being fiscally responsible.\nHow do you feel the county should be handling Blueprint?\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future is designed to improve the quality of education for all children in Maryland and is law. We must ensure that our plan is attainable to meet the goals of the five pillars.\nTalbot County Public Schools and the Board of Education worked in collaboration to create three goals to serve as the priorities for this school year.\nThe goals include ensuring that we recruit and retain a high quality and diverse staff, increase and improve our mathematics Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program (MCAP) scores, and ensure that our schools are safe. These goals directly align with the pillars of the Blueprint.\nWhat goals do the board and district need to be working toward?\nTalbot County Public Schools and the Board have been working toward three goals which are recruiting and retaining a high quality and diverse staff, increasing and improving our mathematics MCAP scores, and ensuring that our schools are safe.\nTCPS and the Board of Education are on target with the three identified goals that we are working towards that align with the needs of the school system, as identified through stakeholder surveys, as well as the Blueprint. TCPS will continue to work collaboratively with stakeholders to continuously improve and meet the needs of our community.\nWhy are you running?\nI am running for a position on the Talbot County Board of Education because not only am I a product of public-school education, I come from a long line of educators and education is my passion.\nMy grandfather was the industrial arts teacher at Moton High School and Easton High School. My mother was a teacher at Easton Middle School, as well as an elementary school teacher in Michigan and Florida.\nMy husband has worked as a special education teacher, assistant principal, principal (Easton High School), and now currently services as the director of student services in Dorchester County. My daughter is a fifth-grade elementary school teacher.\nEducation is extremely important to me and my family, and we have made it our mission to ensure that all students receive a high-quality education.\nStudents deserve to learn in a safe and nurturing environment that allows them to discover their strengths and develop skills that will ensure that they grow to be lifelong learners and productive citizens.\nAs a board member, I want to ensure that our students are safe, healthy and successful. Teachers should be compensated at a wage that respects their professional position and levels of education.\nCommunity stakeholders should be reassured that the students from our school system are provided with the best education and are college and career ready when they graduate from high school. As a member of the board, I will make it my job to do what is necessary for all of our students to succeed.\nWhat will you bring to the board?\nI bring to the Talbot County board more than 20 years of public-school experience.\nMy career in education has progressed from being a teacher to an instructional mathematics coach, human resource administrator, local accountability coordinator, curriculum supervisor for mathematics and career and technical education, and a principal.\nI have learned so much from the various roles that I have had the privilege of working in over the years. I work collaboratively with my colleagues, and the Board of Education is a team that works collaboratively to ensure that we achieve our educational goals.\nI bring respect, leadership and the ability to listen which are all essential to ensuring that our collaboration is productive for our students' success.\nData is showing a lack of kindergarten preparedness since the pandemic. What do you feel needs to be done to help young students catch up to pre pandemic numbers?\nKindergarten preparedness is important, and by providing pre-K to our students, Talbot County Public Schools is taking the initiative to ensure that our students are ready for kindergarten. I will make sure that we are working to start our students on the right path to academic achievement.\nOver the past decade, Talbot County elementary schools have seen a rise in Hispanic students and students for whom English is a second language. What would you suggest or hope to do to better accommodate these students?\nTalbot County Public Schools welcomes all students and now that we are seeing a rise in our Hispanic student population, we are ensuring that we have the appropriate staffing to accommodate our students.\nThis includes making sure that we have the appropriate number of English language teachers and instructional assistants in our schools.\nThe funding formula that has been the guiding principle in our budget mandates that resources are aligned to each school's need.\nThis includes ensuring that funding is available for all students identified within specific student populations. I will work to ensure that all students receive the education and accommodations that they need to succeed.\nOTHER CANDIDATES\nKerry Gunshenan, District 6, is also running for a position on the Board of Education.

    "date": "2024-05-05",
    "author": "JIM JOHNSON",
    "content": "Moms For Liberty fields candidates in elections\n\n May 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM JOHNSON | Section: Columns \n \n 1066\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Voters need to know that three candidates for the Talbot County Board of Education are backed by Moms For Liberty, a group that has raised questions across the country and stirred controversy with its views.I don't think it was a coincidence that none of the three candidates — Ann C. O'Connor in District 2, Karla Wieland-Cherry in District 5 and Kerry Gunshenan in District 6 — submitted a questionnaire the Star Democrat sent to candidates seeking their opinions on why they are running for the Board of Education and their stances on various issues.\nOther candidates in the race submitted the questionnaires and their answers were published in the newspaper this week. This is a common practice in elections to give voters insight into how to cast their ballot.\nThe Associated Press, in a July 2023 story, described Moms For Liberty as a \"parental rights\" group that has sought to take over school boards in multiple states.\nThe group has been accused of harassing community members, advancing anti-LGBTQ+ misinformation and fighting to scrub diverse and inclusive material from lesson plans, according to the AP story.\nMoms for Liberty advocates for various conservative causes in education, such as opposing critical race theory and advocating for school choice. They often mobilize parents to attend school board meetings, petition policymakers, and advocate for changes in curriculum and policies.\nWhether Moms for Liberty poses a threat is a matter of perspective.\nSupporters argue that they are exercising their democratic rights to advocate for their beliefs and values, particularly in education, where they feel their voices have been marginalized.\nCritics raise concerns about the group's impact on public education, the potential for polarization within communities, and whether their advocacy could lead to the undermining of public institutions and democratic processes.\n\"'Parental rights' is an appealing term, but voters have caught on to the reality that it is fueling book bans, anti-LGBT efforts, pressure on teachers not to discuss race and gender, whitewashing history, and so on,\" said political analyst Larry Sabato, a politics professor at the University of Virginia and founder and director of the Center for Politics, who was quoted in a November Washington Post article. \"Parents may want more input in the schools, but as a group they certainly aren't as extreme as many in the Moms for Liberty.\"\nHere in Talbot County, I wish the local candidates had taken the time to write about their stances on issues. There is no doubt that there will be voters in Talbot County who agree with them. In some districts, that may be a majority. Yet few people know what these candidates stand for.\nThe fortunate thing: Due to only two candidates running in each district, all of these candidates will be on the ballot again in November. Only District 2 will be on the May 14 primary ballot. In that district, three candidates will be listed, but Connie Loveland said that she has withdrawn from the race, albeit too late to have her name removed from the ballot.\nThe November election will give these candidates another opportunity to tell voters what they stand for. I hope they take it. Before voters cast their ballots, they deserve to know where candidates stand.\nTalbot County this week celebrated the businesses that keep our region's economy thriving. It was an inspirational event.\n\"Our goal is to connect the business community with resources that will help them succeed and grow, and to tell the stories of business leaders who are doing extraordinary things,\" said Cassandra Vanhooser, director of Talbot County's Department of Economic Development and Tourism.\nBefore the awards, Chris Pilkerton, former acting administrator and general legal counsel for the U.S. Small Business Administration, talked about the value of small businesses in the county. He should know. His wife, Amanda Cook, owns the Tilghman Island Baking Company in Tilghman where the couple live.\n\"Talbot County's small business community actively seeks out ways to work together to support each other and their businesses,\" Pilkerton said. \"That type of environment creates real opportunities for new and existing companies.\"\nHe praised the county's economic development efforts.\n\"I have had the opportunity to travel through many states and counties throughout the country and meet directly with local economic development officials,\" he said. \"In my experience, the team within Talbot County is uniquely supportive of their small businesses and is accessible to help with so many topics as they come up.\"\nPilkerton is right. The team led by Cassandra Vanhooser continues to provide much needed support for businesses both small and large in Talbot County. We are lucky to have such talent here.\nA Washington Post story this week showed alarming data for the Eastern Shore, sea levels are rising quickly along the Gulf coast and Atlantic seaboard. The story documented the change in coastal sea levels between 2010 and 2023, in some cases more than 8 inches in the past 14 years.\n\"Since 2010, it's very abnormal and unprecedented,\" said Jianjun Yin, a climate scientist at the University of Arizona who has studied the changes. While it is possible the swift rate of sea level rise could eventually taper, the higher water that has already arrived in recent years is here to stay.\n\"It's irreversible,\" he said in the story.\nThe study included Cambridge, which has seen a 2.8-inch sea level rise since 2010. That was the only Eastern Shore community listed in the story.\nThis increase should not be a surprise to people in the area. A friend with a home on the Choptank River in Cambridge has pumped out his basement multiple times this year, not due to heavy rains but because of high tides.\nJust over a week ago, Oxford announced a pair of federal grants to address the rising sea levels. One grant of $2.6 million is to raise 14 Oxford homes. Residents in those homes agreed to covering 10% of the cost for their home to be elevated. The other 90% of the cost will be paid by the federal government. Lewis said one of those 14 homes is currently being elevated.\nCommission President Tom Costigan turned to the residents in the room, \"I hope you all appreciate just how gigantic this is.\"\nMany towns on the Eastern Shore are taking steps to deal with this problem. As shown by the sea level increases reported in this week's Washington Post story, there is no time to waste.\nJim Johnson is the Star Democrat executive editor.

    "content": "Elkton teacher has green thumb for growing students' knowledge\n\n May 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 1138\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ELKTON — Most people make the same wrong assumption about Brittany Rigdon.\"No, I did not grow up on a farm,\" Rigdon said with a chuckle, before noting, \"But a lot of people think that I did.\"\nThe mistake is understandable, though, given that Rigdon has been a high school agriculture/horticulture teacher for the past 16 years — the last seven of which in the Cecil County Public Schools system — and that her classroom is a greenhouse.\nBut the reason for the common misconception goes well beyond the basic fact that Rigdon teaches horticulture at the Cecil County School of Technology. For anyone who has interacted with her, the confusion has a lot to do with Rigdon's vast knowledge of horticulture and all subjects related to it.\nPerhaps the biggest reason people mistakenly believe that she has worked on a family farm since childhood, however, is this: Ridgon exudes a green-thumb passion for horticulture and for effectively teaching the subject to her students.\nAnd those are some of the reasons why Rigdon is the 2024 Cecil County Teacher of the Year, a distinction that CCPS officials announced last month during a gala at The Wellwood restaurant in Charlestown.\n'ON OUR LEVEL'\"She does way more than just being a teacher,\" said 18-year-old Colin Schmoker, a Rising Sun High School senior who is one of Ridgon's 18 students in the two-year horticulture program. \"Because of our plant sales, the goals that she sets for herself and for us helps us, as individuals, set our own goals for school, for work and for life in general.\"\nSchmoker was referring to how Rigdon uses a practical-application approach inside her main classroom — a 90'-by-30' greenhouse where, under her guidance, students grow 1,200 poinsettias during the fall semester and then thousands of colorful flowers during the spring semester.\nWith all of the proceeds redirected into the school's horticulture program, Ridgon and her students sell the poinsettias at Christmastime and then, during this time of the year, they sell spring flowers, including ones that have been arranged into prom corsages.\nRigdon's students will be selling class-grown flowers to the public between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Saturday (May 4) during the annual Cecil County School of Technology Spring Showcase on the CCST campus at 912 Appleton Rd., northeast of Elkton.\nDuring the process of preparing for the sales of poinsettias and spring flowers, Ridgon teaches her students about the business side, including pricing to turn a profit.\nRigdon provides her students with much more than backyard-garden skills and techniques for growing plants because this is, after all, a high school horticultural science class taught by a woman who presumably grew up on a farm.\nHer students know how to take soil and texture samples, with the knowledge of which readings are desirable and undesirable and — just as importantly — why. They know how to operate tractors and other landscaping machines.\nRigdon's students also know which pesticides to use, when to use them and how to apply them. Along those lines, all of the seniors in Rigdon's class recently passed a Maryland Department of Agriculture pesticide application class and, as a result, they are legally permitted to spray higher-dose pesticides that are unavailable to the general public. The pesticide-applications certification enables her students to earn a higher wage on landscaping jobs than the pay for uncertified employees.\nIn addition, her students know how to identify scores of plants. One of her students recently passed an academically rigorous exam given by the Maryland Nursery Landscape Greenhouse Association (MNLGA) in which, as part of it, test takers must identify 240 types of plants.\nThree of her students fell short by a half point and will retake the exam next week. The MNLGA test has a 33 percent pass rate and, for those who do make the grade, they are certified professional horticulturalists, which can lead to good-paying jobs and also waivers from certain college classes. Under the MNLGA umbrella are numerous prestiges gardens in the area, including Longwood Gardens.\nThere is much to learn in the CCST horticulture program and, according to her students, Rigdon is quite natural at imparting her wealth of knowledge to them.\n\"She likes to get on our level. She has a way of making us understand,\" said Belle Granger, 17, a Rising Sun High School senior.\nJoel George, an 18-year-old North East High School senior, echoed Belle.\n\"She has a great knowledge about her subject and makes it understandable for every student,\" George said, adding that Rigdon is known to work right alongside her students. \"She doesn't just show up. She helps us.\"\nIt's noteworthy that Schmoker complimented Rigdon's character, too, as did other students. \"She is a kind person,\" Schmoker said. \"She is very well-respected and she treats everyone with respect.\"\n'KIDS LIKE MYSELF'A Wilmington, Del. native who grew up in a suburban neighborhood, Rigdon took classes in the agriculture program at Thomas McKean High School in Hockessin, Del. because she considered pursuing a career as a veterinarian.\nWhile serving as a student aide for her agriculture teacher during her senior year, however, Ridgon made a realization that put her own a different career path.\n\"A lightbulb turned on. I decided that I wanted to teach kids — like myself — that you don't have to grow up on a farm to have a career in agriculture,\" Rigdon said.\nSo, after graduating from Thomas McKean High School in 2004, Rigdon selected her courses accordingly while attending Delaware Valley University in Doylestown, Pa. And in 2008, she graduated from that college with a B.S. Degree in secondary education and agriculture.\nAfter her college graduation and before starting her teaching career, Rigdon served a summer internship at Winerthur Museum, Garden and Library in Delaware. \"I lived on the property and I learned to love plants,\" Rigdon remarked.\nStudents in Rigdon's two-year horticulture program gain the knowledge and experience to work in landscaping, at greenhouses, in florists shops and on farms. Related jobs also can be found in the government sector. In addition, they can go to college and pursue advanced degrees in horticulture.\nIn her Teacher of the Year essay, Rigdon cited a famous quote and then put her own spin on it, taking the liberty to creatively express her belief that each student needs the attention and care of a teacher to flourish.\n\"I wrote, 'To plant a seed is to believe in the future',\" Rigdon said. \"Then I wrote that you have to have more than a belief system to grow a garden. You have to tend to the crops — and every student has his or her own needs.\"\nAlthough she didn't grow up on one, it's noteworthy that Ridgon now lives on a 20-acre farm in Conowingo with her husband, George Rigdon, and that she tends to flower beds there and other chores that come with the bucolic territory.\n\"I married a farm guy,\" Rigdon laughed. \"We have tractors, chickens, hay, pumpkins, raspberries . . .\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Will plan for better pay ease teacher shortage?\n\n May 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AIDAN HUGHES and DARANEE BALACHANDAR Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 911\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fifth-grade teacher Melissa Carpenter works a 10-hour day on average during the week, and her job sometimes requires her to put in hours on weekends, too.\"I feel like teaching is one of those jobs where we go to work to do more work — to do work after work,\" said Carpenter, who teaches at William B. Wade Elementary School in Waldorf in Charles County.\nCarpenter's long hours are far from unique among Maryland's educators, as the state and nation grapple with a teacher shortage.\nThe U.S. Department of Education keeps a Teacher Shortage Areas database — and it found that for the current school year, Maryland was short of teachers in 28 subjects, which the state defines as \"areas of certification.\" That's up from 17 five years earlier. Some teacher certification areas — such as English as a second language, health science and special education — are short on teachers from pre-K through the 12th grade.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future – a landmark state law reforming public education — aims to fix that problem by \"elevating the stature of the teaching profession\" through higher pay, better training and stronger recruitment efforts.\nHowever, experts and educators have mixed views about whether that will successfully address the root causes of the shortage.\n\"Money is a huge help, but it's not everything,\" said Simon Birenbaum, director of grading, assessment and scheduling at Baltimore City Public Schools. \"Human capital is the biggest issue, and money can help with that problem, but recruiting, training and retaining high-quality teachers and staff has to be the primary focus. No amount of money can compensate for a lack of highly-skilled educators.\"\nDOCUMENTING THE SHORTAGE\nMaryland's teacher woes follow national trends. The National Center for Education Statistics reported 86% of U.S. K-12 public schools faced challenges in hiring teachers for the current school year.\nAmid the shortage, the Blueprint calls for hiring an unspecified number of additional teachers to ease the workload of classroom veterans.\n\"You hear a lot about the teacher shortage — and how are we going to implement all these Blueprint programs, which require additional staffing, when we have a teacher shortage?\" asked Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\nShortages stem, in part, from the fact that teachers are leaving the profession. In Prince George's County, 1,126 teachers resigned between July 2022 and July 2023 — up from 989 the previous year, The Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, 625 resigned in Montgomery County Public Schools, up from 576 a year earlier.\nDorchester County experienced the highest attrition rate in Maryland during the 2021-22 school year at 18%, according to a Department of Education report.\n\"I used to never have people just quit in the middle of the year,\" said Dorchester County Superintendent Dave Bromwell, who recently retired. \"The pandemic told some people, you know what? If you're not happy, move on.\"\nAll those factors end up impacting teachers like Carpenter. She said her grade level saw an influx of students, with around 30 students in her own fifth grade class this year.\n\"Our class sizes are growing, and we don't have the support in place to help some of our struggling learners,\" she said.\nBLUEPRINT PAY BUMP\nIn order to address the teacher shortage, the Blueprint provides a number of measures that lawmakers hope will encourage people to become teachers and ensure that existing ones don't leave for more lucrative out-of-state positions – or exit the profession altogether.\nA key Blueprint initiative increases teacher pay to a minimum of $60,000 by 2026. In some counties, that means a nearly $15,000 pay bump for new teachers.\nDavid Larner, chief human resource and professional development officer at the Howard County Public School System, said the pay raise will attract teachers from other states and build up Maryland's teacher workforce.\n\"If our salaries are higher than salaries in surrounding states … then candidates are more likely to come,\" Larner said.\nHowever, Hansen, of the Brookings Institution, expressed skepticism about the likely impact of the measure on the state's teacher shortage.\nHansen argued that rather than a universal rise in minimum salary levels, money should be targeted where it's needed the most – attracting teacher talent in high-need schools and specialized fields like STEM subjects and special education. He also highlighted research that suggests salary is just one of many factors that can lead to teacher attrition.\n\"I think we need to be paying teachers more – I don't think paying a $60,000 minimum wage is the way to do it,\" he said.\nWORK IN PROGRESS\nBeyond the Blueprint, the General Assembly last year passed the Maryland Educator Shortage Reduction Act, which requires the state to set recruitment goals for teacher education programs, creates an alternative teacher prep program for early childhood educators and establishes a $20,000 yearly stipend for eligible student teachers.\nGov. Wes Moore, who proposed the legislation, said upon signing it that it is intended to place \"world-class teachers in every classroom.\"\nCarpenter, the Charles County teacher, said future changes may be necessary, too.\n\"We will have new students next year, and they will [have] different needs. So we need to make sure that we are constantly evolving,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Sparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George's County, stressed that reinforcing the teacher workforce is key to the Blueprint's overall success.\n\"It lands in the hands of our educators, and if we don't have educators who are highly qualified or able to do the work, then the Blueprint work would never get accomplished,\" she said.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "School officials: Blueprint money is not enough\n\n May 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: OLIVIA BORGULA and OLIVIA YASHAROFF Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1614\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n You might think spending $16.6 billion more in state funds from 2024 through 2029 — and billions more after that — would be enough to give Maryland a world-class education system. But that's not what many people at the state's local school districts think.For proof, look at what local district leaders said in March when they updated state officials on efforts to implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's landmark effort to rebuild its public schools.\n\"The funding provided under the Blueprint is not sufficient to meet all of the requirements,\" officials in the Baltimore City Public School System wrote.\n\"Blueprint funding tied to specific programs for expansion requires the elimination of other programs and supports,\" the St. Mary's County Public School System's report said.\nMeanwhile, in Kent County, school officials bemoaned that the district will see increased costs related to staffing, data systems, student support and transportation.\n\"KCPS has found that many of the requirements of the Blueprint come without subsequent funding sources to sufficiently cover full implementation,\" district officials wrote.\nCreated by legislation passed by the General Assembly in 2021, the Blueprint is built on five pillars: expanding pre-K to all 4-year-olds and low-income 3-year-olds, improving the teacher workforce, changing curriculums statewide to prepare students for college and careers, expanding funding and setting up a state agency to oversee it all.\nBut in those March updates, 15 of the state's 24 school districts listed funding or resource allocations among the three central challenges they face under the Blueprint.\nMeanwhile, some county officials — such as Harford County Executive Bob Cassilly — say the Blueprint is unaffordable.\n\"Unrealistic state spending mandates for the Blueprint for Education are straining local budgets statewide and should be paused and revisited,\" Cassilly said as he unveiled the county's latest budget April 15.\nNEW MANDATESWhile dramatically boosting state funding for public education over a decade, the Blueprint asks local school districts — and taxpayers — to do their part. And that is causing some concern among the state's school principals, said Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\n\"In education, one thing that sometimes happens is we get unfunded mandates, and unfunded mandates are very challenging,\" Kaufman said at a principals conference late last year.\nCounty leaders find the mandates challenging, too. In a letter to Gov. Wes Moore — a Democrat and strong supporter of the Blueprint — the Maryland Association of Counties last November listed a litany of concerns. They said the Blueprint's cost estimates don't take into account the bottom-line local impact of several major spending items, including:\nConstruction costs for additional classrooms needed under the plan's expansion of pre-K.Classroom modifications to accommodate instructional changes called for under the Blueprint plan to expand career and technical education.Additional staffing for special education students and English language learners.The new minimum $60,000 teacher salary starting in 2026 and other efforts to construct a \"career ladder\" for Maryland teachers.\nNoting that local education funding has already reached all-time highs, the Maryland Association of Counties said: \"This record county funding, combined with greater funding requirements mandated by the law, will limit counties' ability to fund competing governmental needs at basic operational levels.\"\nThe Blueprint's burden on local school districts is only beginning to be felt. By 2034, local school districts will be expected to pay $700 million more annually than they would if the Blueprint hadn't been adopted, a 2022 state report projected.\n\"As the Blueprint ramps up and the formulas increase, more and more counties will have to put more funds in because the local share will increase,\" said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board, the statewide agency created to oversee the Blueprint. \"We're just in the early first couple of years of Blueprint implementation. So it's only four or five counties that are required to put in more than they have been. But over time, it will be more than half of them.\"\nTROUBLE IN COUNTIESTo hear county officials tell it, though, the Blueprint's mandates are already leaving them in a pinch.\nWhen the Blueprint began its rollout, Dorchester County saw a $3 million jump in local funding contributions, according to County Council President Lenny Pfeffer.\n\"That $3 million jump was devastating to us,\" Pfeffer said. \"We had to pull from every resource and cut some programs that we wanted to do as far as highway maintenance, bridge maintenance and other things like that.\"\nMeanwhile in Cecil County, a school funding battle tied in part to the Blueprint led to the creation of a Facebook group — Fund CCPS — with 6,700 members.\nCecil County Executive Danielle Hornberger, a Republican, has refused to meet the school district's funding request. And last month, Hornberger filed an ethics complaint against Cecil County Schools Superintendent Jeffrey Lawson, accusing him of using public property and funds for political purposes in the budget battle.\n\"CCPS families deserve better,\" Hornberger said.\nThat prompted an angry response from Allison Stoudt, the Rising Sun High School senior who founded the Fund CCPS Facebook group. Noting that the county has funded local schools \"at the legal minimum\" for three years running and that its current budget proposal falls $13 million short of the $17 million in additional local aid the district is seeking, Stoudt called Hornberger's accusation against Lawson \"shameful.\"\nIn Worcester County, the county government has similarly refused to increase school funding above the state requirement minimums, leading to a $9 million cash shortfall that could force the district to trim between 90 and 100 staff positions.\n\"It is WCPS' belief that drastically cutting instructional staff runs contrary to the spirit of the Blueprint's goals of continual improvement and transformation in education,\" district officials said in their March Blueprint update.\nSHIFTING RESOURCESThe Blueprint calls for shifting resources within school districts at the expense of other schools.\nCarroll County Public Schools Superintendent Cynthia McCabe explained the potential ramifications of that change at a public meeting in Sykesville last year.\n\"What I don't want to be is a fearmonger, but I also don't want to get to September of 2024 and have parents calling me saying, 'Why are the class sizes so much bigger in my child's school this year?'\" McCabe said during the presentation.\nThe Blueprint shifts funding to higher-need schools in several ways.\nThe education reform plan provides \"concentration of poverty\" grants to some schools to bolster support for academics, extracurriculars, and mental and physical health. Grants are given to schools based on the number of students receiving free and reduced-price meals. In this fiscal year, 454 schools in Maryland received concentration of poverty grants, with just over one- fourth given to schools in Baltimore City.\n\"Especially the community where I serve within my district, they've benefited greatly from having concentrations of poverty funding,\" said Ashley Moore, principal at the Empowerment Academy, a charter school in Baltimore City.\nIn addition, a new requirement under the Blueprint requires students who qualify for Medicaid to automatically be enrolled in free and reduced-price school meals.\n\"This is an improvement from the standpoint of feeding kids,\" said Christopher Meyer, a research analyst at the Maryland Center on Economic Policy.\nBut shifting resources to the schools that need them leads to ramifications elsewhere.\nIn Baltimore County, for example, average class sizes will go from 25 to 24 in grades 1-3 starting in the fall, but middle school class sizes will grow from 20 to 22 while high school class sizes will increase from 21 to 23.\nAt a February media briefing, Baltimore County Schools Superintendent Myriam Rogers said elementary school class sizes have been reduced under the Blueprint because making sure students can read by third grade \"has been proven time and time again to be an indicator of success.\" In addition, she noted that fifth-graders must pass state tests on reading and math.\nAsked if the larger class sizes in other grades could negatively impact students, Rogers replied: \"No,\" saying district officials were being careful in how they were planning to adjust class sizes.\nBut McCabe, the Carroll County superintendent, reiterated her concern about class-size adjustments called for under the Blueprint.\n\"We are concerned that very large class sizes will be detrimental to student learning,\" McCabe said in an email. \"As we are seeing increased mental health concerns in our student population. It is essential that teachers have a manageable class size in order to meet the varied needs of students.\"\nTHE FUTUREThe Blueprint's long rollout period — along with the nation's post-pandemic bout with inflation — could pose other financial concerns to local school districts.\nMapping out the potential district-level impact of the Blueprint in 2022, the Maryland State Department of Legislative Services projected that 15 of the state's 24 school districts would have to increase local funding levels at some point before the Blueprint rollout is complete in 2034.\n\"The impacts are not uniform … leading several counties to need to make significant increases in their local appropriation to the boards of education in the early years, later years, or both,\" the state report said. \"Other county governments are forecast to spend about the same or slightly more than they would have otherwise.\"\nOf course, inflation could impact those projections. Meyer, the research analyst with the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, noted the Blueprint's cost projections were made before prices skyrocketed at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Actual costs in the economy have gone way up, but the funding amounts that are required under state law haven't,\" Meyer said.\nThat being the case, it's possible that some of the funding requirements in the Blueprint may be changed at some point, either by the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board or the General Assembly.\n\"No law is ever perfect,\" Maryland Education Coalition co-chair Rick Tyler Jr. said. \"We're still early in the process of what is intended to be a 10-year process.\"\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Even if the answer is no, Dr. Toughlove is sure you will enjoy the book \"Aaron Slater, Illustrator\", written by Andrea Beaty and Illustrated by David Roberts. Beaty and Roberts have produced a string of New York Times best-selling books including \"Iggy Peck, Architect\", \"Rosie Revere, Engineer\", \"Ada Twist, Scientist\", and \"Sofia Valdez, Future Prez.\"\nThis enchanting, rhyming tale is about a boy named Aaron who loves to listen to stories and dreams of writing a story someday. But when he goes to school, he struggles to learn to write. \"But the words are just squiggles, and try though he might, even with help Aaron can't get it right. Why can't I do it? Why is it so hard? He goes back to drawing on slate in his yard.\" (p. 8-9).\nAaron's self-confidence is shaken by his inability to excel at reading and writing, and his effervescent personality is transformed into a quiet, inconspicuous young boy. But in grade two, something magical happens. Aaron realizes that although writing and reading aloud is a challenge, his superpower is his ability to capture his thoughts with pictures. \"His art makes the difference. His art leads the way and helps him discover what he wants to say.\" (p. 32).\nSpeaking of pictures, the illustrations in \"Aaron Slater, Illustrator\" emanate joy and beauty and just jump off the page. Dr. Toughlove loves colorful illustrations, and this book does not disappoint. It is no wonder that David Roberts illustrations have received so much acclaim.\nIf children wish to explore art further, \"Aaron Slater's Big Project Book for Astonishing Artists\" provides additional information about how art influences our world and includes follow-up art projects as well. If you go to Andrea Beaty's website (andreabeaty.com) there are downloadable coloring sheets and other goodies available.\nThe rhyming verses in this book are also ideal for emergent readers who are working on learning how to sound out words, which is one of the cornerstones of mastering reading. \"Aaron Slater, Illustrator\" is appropriate for children aged 4-7 and is available at your county library.\nCarol Franks-Randall has a doctorate in education and is a retired educator and children's book author. She lives in Centreville and each month writes children's book reviews as Dr. Toughlove, one of the protagonists in her first book, \"Jamal and Me.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maple Elementary School celebrates Teacher Appreciation Week\n\n May 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 495\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — During Teacher Appreciation Week at Maple Elementary School, administrators planned various activities and events to boost staff morale and show the appreciation that administrators and students have for their teachers.Myesha Ford, principal at Maple Elementary, said the goal was to find activities that would get teachers working together and complementing each other, as well as spreading kindness and joy throughout the building.\n\"I feel like if our teachers are happy, and they can come to work and just kind of be able to love what they do, that kind of transfers over to the students,\" Ford said. \"So we see when our teachers are happy, our students are happy.\"\nFord said they set up games for the week with the reality show \"Survivor\" as the theme. Teachers would spin a wheel, and the number that they get would correlate to a challenge. The challenges included writing a paragraph of praise to a fellow teacher and sending it to the principal to give the message anonymously.\nHaley Wright, a teacher at Maple Elementary, said she had a lot of fun this week. She enjoyed the appreciation she received from staff and the chance to connect with other teachers at the school.\n\"It allows teachers who may not always see each other or maybe they're able to establish new friendships among their staff members. The kids really get into it,\" Wright said. \"On their morning announcements, students asked staff to ask us, 'Did we spin the wheel?' 'What challenge are we going to work on today?' So I think it also allows for the students to get excited about it, too.\"\nNatalie Drake, teacher at Maple Elementary, said she enjoyed the work that the administration put into this week, especially while making it a team activity. Drake described how teachers and support staff were split into teams to earn points to be the winning team at the end of the week.\nBy far, Drake's favorite part was feeling seen by other teachers and staff at the school.\n\"I did receive one of those anonymous emails today, and that really just put a smile on my face,\" Drake said. \"Other people here at school recognize the hard work that we all put in. They're very appreciative of all that we do here. So not just our administration appreciates us, but also our colleagues are appreciative of us.\"\nFor Ford, teachers work hard all year, and with standardized testing, it is easy for everyone to feel a bit burned out this time of the year. These events are meant to refresh everyone and provide a positive outlet for energy for teachers, staff and students.\n\"Teaching is hard. But it's fun, and it's rewarding,\" Ford said. \"I enjoy seeing my teachers in action, their passion, and you can truly tell that they care about all of their students, and it just makes me feel good. It makes me proud to be the principal here and just proud to be able to work with such amazing educators.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I have purposely waited to announce my candidacy because I was curious what type of hate I was going to start to encounter.Well ... the Star Democrat has wasted no time with starting to blatantly attack my character because Moms for Liberty is endorsing me. Jim Johnson (editor) wrote an article (May 5) stating that he \"wished the local candidates had taken the time to write about stances on issues.\" Well, Mr. Johnson, if you remember the phone call I made to you the other day (Wednesday), you would be amiss to remember that I stated that I was still seeking to learn input from parents around the area on their concerns with schools and education, that I was finishing four college courses related to my jobs in nursing and real estate, was focusing on getting my volunteer work aligned and preparing for surgery so I could start campaigning in June. I also told you I had emailed the writer and told her I would be happy to meet with face to face to discuss her questions.\nSo don't start questioning my character, ideologies, or stance on anything just because I didn't feel I was prepared to answer your questions at the time and a group you claim to \"pose a threat\" is giving me support. Maybe you pose a threat more with your own biased hatred and to know you haven't even met me yet.\nSince I posted this on Facebook first, I haven't been let down with the haters. Wow.

    "content": "Quality child care is a collective responsibility\n\n May 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREW MOSS | Section: Columns \n \n 439\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n To their credit, many Republican leaders, particularly at the state level, recognize the magnitude of the child care crisis and have been working to address it through various funding fixes (such as grants, tax credits) in their respective states. But the reality is that, at the national level, their party remains the principal roadblock to any meaningful, long-term solutions.To understand all this, it's necessary to consider the broad contours of the crisis. During and following the pandemic, many child care centers closed, and many areas of the country, known as \"child care deserts,\" today have critical shortages of licensed slots for children.\nMeanwhile, thousands of centers remain under-enrolled because operators can't afford to pay early childhood educators competitive wages. At an average hourly rate of $13.71 in 2022, early childhood educators are among the lowest paid workers in the country.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, child care should constitute no more than 7% of a family's income, but costs for a family with two children in care can range anywhere from 10% to 33% of a family's budget, exceeding rental and mortgage costs in many states.\nJust last month, Congress passed, and the president signed, a $1.2 trillion funding bill that included almost $9 billion for child care and $12 billion for Headstart, the early childhood program for low-income families. But even those funds will serve a relatively small fraction of eligible families, and the state-level fixes, helpful as they are, will only go so far.\nRepublicans have resisted more substantive solutions to the child care crisis out of a familiar opposition to many, if not most, forms of social spending — sometimes labeling them \"socialist,\" other times describing child care itself as disruptive to traditional family roles, that is a mother at home. The net result places the burden of care on individuals and individual families, a proposition that works only for the most affluent.\nThe alternative is to recognize — as many European countries do — that high quality care, whether for small children or for the elderly, is a collective responsibility. This idea is the essence of what many call a \"caring society,\" a society that enshrines care as a human right and that values the well-being of all individuals, all families, no matter what their socio-economic status may be.\nBut for millions, the child care crisis remains a troubling problem that won't solve itself. Alternatives beckon; other possibilities for a caring society beckon. Will these inspire action?\nAndrew Moss, syndicated by PeaceVoice, writes on labor, nonviolence, and culture from Los Angeles.

I do not speak for the group in any capacity, only as a member who shares their concerns.\nThe group was formed as a local group during the COVID-19 response, called the Family Advocacy Alliance ... citizens concerned about the nationwide push for masking of our children and the school closure mandates. Later the teaching of critical race theory and gender fluidity became a major concern. The group only later joined the M4L organization.\nMany parents are dismayed that kids are being taught they are either \"oppressors\" or \"oppressed\" depending on their race. They are being told such things as \"boys can have babies\" and that people can actually change their gender ... in school. Trans boys were allowed to compete against girls in sports and use female bathrooms.\nThey are finding books in their children's elementary school libraries with sexually explicit photos of every imaginable sex act. If we want books removed, it is this kind of book to which we are objecting. (Banning books like Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, I find objectionable.)\nSince the school \"report cards\" came out and showed dismal proficiency scores in math and English for all grade levels in Talbot County, a major concern of the group.\nThe Maryland Board of Education Blueprint for the Future (with its mandates regarding some of these issues that are tied to school funding) is another major concern.\nMoms for Liberty of Talbot would like to support Talbot school board candidates who have these issues front and center. People who can think out of the box and find solutions that have been elusive when following the national and state agendas. We want a school board that will demand proficiency at all grade levels.\nI am not aware of any candidates that have been endorsed by Moms for Liberty to date.\nAbove and beyond all else Moms for Liberty stresses parents' rights to have a major voice in their children's education and the major say in their social and sexual upbringing. M4L members believe that schools are there to teach our kids how to think critically, not what to think.\nI suggest that you and your staff do some basic research before printing.\nKENT ROBERTSON\nRoyal Oak \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This trust is founded in my own experiences. Kindly leave our children alone, Moms for Liberty.\nMoms for Liberty is an extremist organization grounded in advocacy for issues that are irrelevant and misplaced in Talbot County. Moms for Liberty advocates against rights for all, complicating issues around equality, ethnicity, advocating for book bans in school, and opposing common sense, scientifically grounded health care policies in schools.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that tracks extremism, has designated them an extremist group. Moms for Liberty is jamming the zone with rhetoric and conspiracy, purposefully misguiding those who listen and downplaying the everyday achievements made by our school system including the successes of our staff and students. They are a growing organization with chapters across the country. Talbot County's chapter chooses to be affiliated with this organization and proudly trumpets that affiliation.\nIt's important to understand the candidates that Moms for Liberty is endorsing in Talbot County, as these candidates will become a mouthpiece of the organization, and continue to propagate anti-education, anti-diversity rhetoric.\nAs the Star Democratic reminded us, candidates recruited and endorsed by Moms for Liberty in Talbot County include:\nAnne O'Conner.Kerry Gunshenan.Karla Wieland Cherry.\nAt best, these candidates are accepting an endorsement from this divisive, extremist organization that has no place in our county, without understanding what that endorsement means. At worst, these candidates subscribe to this unhinged web of lies and will play an active role in their conspiracies.\nEither way, I do not support these candidates, nor should you.\nTOTCH HARTGE\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In absolute terms, St. Mary's charges lower tuition than it did in the 2013-2014 academic year — a difference magnified significantly by inflation over that period of more than 30%, according to a release from the college.\nThe board-approved increase of 3.9% for room and board reflects the increased costs of goods and services as well as an increase in the Maryland minimum wage.\nThe meeting was led for the final time by outgoing Chair Susan L. Dyer, who completed the maximum three-year term. A commercial real estate developer and managing partner in a restaurant in Leonardtown, Dyer has more than 30 years of experience as a recognized leader and expert in information technology strategy, design, development and delivery of large-scale business and scientific systems.\n\"It has been my absolute pleasure to serve as chair of this outstanding board of trustees and our equally amazing faculty and exceptional staff,\" Dyer said. \"Under the tremendous vision and leadership of President Jordan, we have consistently focused on determining the best outcomes for our students, which truly reflects the heart of this institution.\"\nUnder Dyer's leadership, the trustees oversaw significant positive changes, including maintaining the aforementioned tuition freeze and long-range tuition strategy, the approval of new academic majors, the approval of the three-year Rising Tide strategic plan and an upgrade of the college's credit rating, according to the release.\nDyer will be replaced as chair by John Bell, a 1995 graduate of St. Mary's College who is the managing director of Wells Fargo Corporate & Investment Bank. Bell is the first alumnus to chair the board of trustees.\nThe board was informed by Jordan of her decision to retire in June 2025, and of the transition of the college's Taking the LEAD fundraising campaign to a How High Can We Fly phase for its final year after eclipsing its initial goal of $20 million a year ahead of schedule.\n\"Ten years ago, I said 'now is the time'—the time to become a model of what higher education can achieve, the time for us — the invisible — to become visible,\" Jordan, who as appointed president of the college in 2014, said. \"I am immensely proud of our shared accomplishments including the increasing diversity of our student body, steady enrollment growth, curricular and co-curricular innovations, the focus on an expanding campus culture where everyone can thrive, and deeper partnerships with the broader community.\"\nThe board also approved the 2024-2025 meeting calendar, the awarding of degrees to the Class of 2024, a new attendance policy, diversity report, state capital budget proposal and its authority and responsibility matrix. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Will Maryland’s Blueprint for education work?\n\n May 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LIZZY ALSPACH and APURVA MAHAJAN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1394\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland plans to spend $16.6 billion through 2029, along with billions more after that, to improve its public schools.But will it work?\nState legislators created a seven-member oversight board to ensure it would.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a transformative education law passed in 2021, aims to boost student performance and education quality throughout Maryland schools. It outlines these goals in five pillars: the expansion of prekindergarten, the hiring and retention of high-quality and diverse teachers and leaders, college and career readiness, additional resources, and accountability and governance.\nLawmakers established the Blueprint's Accountability and Implementation Board to monitor the Blueprint's progress. The board oversees funding and initiative implementation while providing guidance to school districts, all with the intention of improving academic performance in Maryland.\n\"I think part of it is just understanding that we can do better, we need to do better and we're going to do better,\" said Rachel Hise, executive director of the accountability board. \"That's the promise of the Blueprint.\"\nSchool leaders across the state tend to agree — but they said the Blueprint comes with complications that go beyond the financial challenges it poses to the state and its 24 public school districts. Educators said they're concerned about the Blueprint's deadlines, a lack of detailed procedural information and the plan's overall place in the educational system.\n\"Implementing a law as comprehensive as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future is going to be a herculean effort under the best of circumstances,\" Baltimore City Public Schools officials wrote in their May 1 report to the accountability board. \"But combined with the added complexities of pandemic recovery, delays that resulted in extremely limited pre-implementation planning time for districts, and the slow pace of regulations and guidance pertaining to the Blueprint, the challenges are amplified.\"\nAssessing the BlueprintThe Accountability and Implementation Board will oversee the progress of each public school system in implementing Blueprint initiatives.\nThe board is by law required to:\nDevelop a plan to fully implement the Blueprint in public school systems, complete with timelines and deadlines.Monitor the progress school districts and the state are making regarding the Blueprint by reporting annually on 92 data measures, which collect information on student performance, teacher preparation and outcomes backed by Blueprint funding.Determine if changes need to be made to the plan to achieve the plan's original goals.Ensure \"Expert Review Teams\" of teachers, faculty and staff observe schools and understand how to make recommendations about changing how the plan is implemented.Release about a quarter of Blueprint funds each year to school systems that are implementing initiatives properly.Hire an independent contractor to evaluate the Blueprint's success.Ensure school systems demonstrate at least 75% of funding received per student follows the students to their school.\nUnder the law, the accountability board can withhold funding from school systems that fail to implement Blueprint initiatives or show significant student progress.\nThe board holds routine meetings to hear from Marylanders. It also has a series of advisory groups to gather feedback from teachers, parents, students and other stakeholders, according to Laura Stapleton, a board member and chair of the University of Maryland's Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methodology.\n\"There's so many moving parts,\" Stapleton said. \"Many different stakeholders are needed to implement all the various parts of the Blueprint.\"\nStretching deadlinesEvery Maryland public school district is responsible for rolling out Blueprint initiatives and collecting each of the 92 different data measures for the Accountability and Implementation Board to evaluate, Stapleton said.\nBut school district officials said none of that is easy.\n\"With educational reform of this scale, it is difficult to keep up with the constant changes, timelines and work of each pillar,\" Carroll County school district leaders said in their May 1 submission to the accountability board.\nJanine Bacquie, Montgomery County Public Schools' Blueprint implementation coordinator, said her district is straining to properly gather data and implement Blueprint initiatives within allocated deadlines.\n\"We're struggling to get the guidance that we need to do the work that we need to do with a short timeline,\" Bacquie said. \"If we had another year or two, it'd certainly take some of the pressure off.\"\nAll 24 school districts were originally required to submit their final Blueprint implementation plans by March 2024.\nBut because the state provided necessary materials — such as report templates and expectations — to districts only two months before the March deadline, the submission schedule was revised.\nThe March deadline was changed so it only had to be a 10-page preliminary report, according to Bacquie. The final report deadline was then pushed back to May 1.\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board is facing a tough deadline, too. According to Stapleton, an independent contractor is set to perform an evaluation of the Blueprint by October.\nBut Stapleton said she hopes the deadline for the evaluation can be pushed back a few years to give the Blueprint's many initiatives more time to lead to change.\nA slow flow of informationMeanwhile, Blueprint information seems to move slowly to and through the state's school districts.\n\"Because the implementation of Blueprint is massive and encompasses the entire district, one of the biggest challenges is communicating with employees the ways in which their work already aligns with the Blueprint,\" Prince George's County school officials said in their March 2024 submission to the accountability board.\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board holds regular meetings on Zoom for anyone to attend. All meetings are held online and published in an online archive for anyone to view.\nBut Javier Valera, a math content specialist at a public middle school in Montgomery County, said he and other teachers have no clue about the depth of information in the Blueprint.\nHe said the state should work harder to keep teachers informed.\nChanges are coming next year, \"and we don't even know anything about it,\" Valera said. \"It is concerning, because we are going to be the ones implementing the plan. … There should be more transparency and they need to talk with us and let us know what is this about.\"\nSparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George's County, echoed Valera's sentiments about a need for more details about the Blueprint.\n\"There's a lot of information that definitely needs to be clarified,\" Jefferson said. \"I think it needs to be disseminated in a clear, concise manner where of course our principals are able to understand — and understand the impact that it has for each school.\"\nMembers of the accountability board encourage community members to provide feedback. Principals, parents and teachers are urged to reach out about the Blueprint, Rachel Amstutz, the accountability board's policy director, said at a principals conference late last year.\n\"We need to hear from the local level what's happening and what you need,\" Amstutz said. \"We need to hear from our parents what's working for their kids and what isn't.\"\nLingering concernsImplementing the Blueprint hasn't gone exactly as planned so far. Deadlines for criteria and implementation plans have been extended at least three times. And in district-level Blueprint plans submitted this spring, school officials across the state expressed a variety of concerns.\n\"From funding uncertainties to staffing shortages and delays in receiving critical guidance, the district must navigate various obstacles to ensure the successful execution of Blueprint initiatives,\" Caroline County school officials said in their March submission to the accountability board.\nMeanwhile, school officials in Allegany County said workforce issues make implementing the Blueprint a challenge. \"Sustaining district-level initiatives across all schools is difficult because of staff retirements and turnover rates,\" officials wrote in their May 1 report.\nIn their Blueprint update, St. Mary's County school officials said they are concerned about all the elements of public education the Blueprint ignores. Other crucial parts of the learning experience could see funding cuts as the district strives to meet the Blueprint's mandates, they said.\n\"The ubiquitous challenge inherent in meeting Blueprint goals is in the fact that the Blueprint is silent on supporting all else, i.e., the arts, athletics, enrichment and after-school programming, transportation, facilities, health care, etc.,\" St. Mary's County school officials wrote. \"These elements of school are necessary and imperative in supporting the whole child.\"\nAmid all the concerns, Bacquie, Montgomery County's Blueprint coordinator, said further delays may be necessary. The rush to complete various measures in the Blueprint could render the plan to reinvent Maryland's public schools less effective than it could otherwise be, she said.\n\"It's not something where you just come in and say something's going to change overnight,\" Bacquie said. \"You're changing hearts, thoughts, minds, strategies.\"\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was in her second year of teaching.\n\"Her loss leaves a big hole in the heart of Sandy Hill Elementary School,\" the letter says.\nCockey — who also coached the school's cheer team — was high-energy, friendly and lively, Gibson writes in the letter.\n\"Even if you're child was not a student of Miss Cockey, they will probably know her as she was very engaged with the life of the school,\" Gibbson said.\nBefore coming to Sandy Hill to teach, Cockey interned at Vienna Elementary School during the 2021 to 2022 school year, Dorchester County Public Schools communications and community outreach specialist Valerie Goff said.\nAccording to an email from Maryland State Police, a preliminary investigation found that Cockey — who was traveling westbound on U.S. Route 50 near Maryland Route 347 in Hebron — drifted left for unknown reasons and partially entered a left turn lane, striking the rear of a box truck. MSP said Cockey continued to travel through the center median, going west across the eastbound Route 50 lanes and sideswiping a Mazda CX-4 before coming to a stop in a field.\nCockey was pronounced dead on the scene. No other deaths or injuries were reported in the ongoing investigation.\nGoff said that along with notifying the school community of Cockey's death via a letter, Gibson called and spoke with each of the families of Cockey's students.\nOn Thursday morning, students and staff began the day in small classroom circle discussions to share their feelings and offer support.\nGoff said education psychologists, social workers and counselors from other schools were brought to the school, as well as external partners like Mid Shore Mediation, Life's Energy Wellness Center and Mobile Crisis.\nGoff said these extra supports would be available to students and staff on Friday, and from there, the school would \"play it by ear.\"\n\"People are on call, so they'll be coming in on an as-needed basis,\" she said.\nIn the classroom circles, the extra counselors, social workers, psychologists and partners were great in supporting teachers, Goff said. She said some teachers were still in shock about the loss of their colleague.\n\"It was great having that extra support there at the school, both from other schools and from, as I said, our external partners,\" she said.\nTeachers were given resources about grief to use with their students.\nGoff said that students — particularly fourth and fifth graders — have started conversations about how the school community can memorialize Cockey.\n\"There are going to be plans about that,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Foremost, salary increases, with the next priority to address health insurance cost increases (approximately 8%), and an increase in utilities; adjusting for what was also an increase in FY24, and subsequently adjusted for in FY25.\n\"It was a very tight and very concerning push and shove…for coming up with the budget,\" Couch said.\nAdding to the challenge, everything is placed in designated line items now, Couch said, referring to the requirements coming from the Accountability and Implementation Board (another component of the Blueprint) that dictates how funds are allocated and prevents the transfer of funds among categories.\n\"Right now we can't see how it's going to work and its going to be very muddy and its going to be devastating I think unless something changes,\" she said, The AIB consultant is very much aware of this problem and can help us try to figure it out.\nOf the proposed budget, \"This is what I believe what we need to operate our school system,\" Couch said. \"If we don't get the money to make this budget, we will need to figure out what we can do without.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester BOE passes emergency virtual education plan with amendment\n\n May 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 647\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — A drafted prolonged state of emergency virtual education plan, now required by the state through a Maryland Senate bill, brought discussion among the Dorchester County Board of Education at a board meeting Thursday.Dorchester County Public Schools' Jodi Colman, the director of curriculum, instruction and assessment, said the drafted plan includes information about staffing, personnel, student instruction and assessment and learning supports in the event of an emergency that is longer than 14 consecutive days. The plan can be amended as needed when entering into a state of emergency, she said.\n\"The purpose of this is in case something like COVID happened,\" she said about the plan.\nColman said the district needs to submit its plan to the Maryland State Department of Education by June 1.\nAfter Colman talked about why the plan is needed, board member Talibah Chikwendu asked why the draft plan requires that content supervisors are invited into Schoology classrooms, a school management system that connects students and teachers online.\nChikwendu said as a teacher, she puts multiple plans in different places and adjusts those plans based on what she's seeing in the classroom and how students are doing. She said she doesn't like the idea of someone else being able to go into the Schoology classroom and possibly move around or delete things.\n\"Especially if I'm going to be held accountable or made responsible for what is in there,\" she said.\nBoard member Sheri Hubbard asked if this is something content supervisors have access to now. Chikwendu said that they did not currently have that access and that it needs to be given upon request.\n\"Which certainly they could request and certainly a teacher should do,\" Chikwendu said. \"But they don't automatically have it. This plan says that they automatically have to do this, and I don't like that.\"\nColman said her intention for including that line in the plan was to be a support for teachers and not so that supervisors could go into Schoology and make changes.\n\"As you're wearing your teacher hat, if you're not seeing that as a support, that's not what I was going for,\" Colman said to Chikwendu.\nChikwendu said she agreed with offering it as a support but did not like the idea of making it mandatory. The board voted to approve the prolonged emergency virtual education plan on the condition that the content supervisor line is amended to be offered as support rather than mandatory.\nBefore the board passed the plan, the subject of camera usage in virtual classrooms was also brought up. In the plan, it says that cameras need to be turned on in the event that classes become virtual.\nChikwendu said she understood why having cameras on is important, but brought up concerns with bandwidth.\n\"When you have a classroom of even 15 students and all of their cameras are on and your camera is on, the bandwidth is horrible,\" she said, later adding, \"I get why we need to turn them on, I'm just wondering how we manage the bandwidth issues that come with keeping a whole class together for the period of time the Google Meet is on if we have all those kids' cameras on at the same time.\"\nColman said she went back and forth on this aspect of the plan. She said the district learned with the COVID-19 pandemic that not requiring cameras to be on creates a lack of accountability. She said a sentence could be added to the plan to explain that cameras can be turned off in the event of wifi or bandwidth issues.\nChikwendu said she just wanted to make sure everyone was aware of the issue.\nThe board also talked about students not feeling comfortable with classmates and teachers seeing their homes in the background in virtual classroom settings. Hubbard suggested using a standard background for all students on camera so that students' homes aren't in view. Colman said this was something the district could do. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "BOE approves Sysco food services\n\n May 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 683\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — Retaining food service employees is on the menu as the Queen Anne's County Public Schools Board of Education approved Sysco Eastern Maryland, LLC for food delivery services during its workshop meeting May 15.Facing a turbulent budget cycle the school board approved shifting its food service program to join a partnership with Maryland's Shore Educational Food Service Consortium contract with Sysco for the delivery of food and related products.\n\"There is no intention to cut any hourly staff, the number of people that are in the kitchens right now are needed to run those kitchens,\" Julie Hickey, coordinator of food services said.\nWith a variety of reasons the district made the food service decision, cost was one of them. The Sodexo contract was set to expire on June 30 and QACPS is now joining 22 other school systems that run in-house food-service programs in their districts.\nAs of July 2024, QACPS food services will be self-operational and no longer operated by Sodexo as a food service management company. In order to be self operational, a vendor contract is needed to provide the necessary food and items which is currently being procured through the district's food service management company, according to Hickey.\nThe district looks to save money in aspects such as management, by going self operational, she said, and will be joining forces with MSEC to join in a contract with Sysco.\nCaroline County put forth a bid for food and food related items and Sysco was the only bid received, Hickey said.\nThe MSEC contract contains a clause for Queen Anne's to partner and utilize the services. The contract was recently renewed for the third year to begin July 2024 with two more years of renewal options, she said.\nThe total estimated cost for FY25 is $800,000 and will utilize the food service balance account, according to Hickey.\nFood service department staff have been notified of the district's conversion to self-operational and have been given the opportunity to ask questions.\n\"No hourly positions are being cut and they are all encouraged to reapply when the positions become available, \" Hickey said.\nBoard member Richard Smith noted, \"I was back in the day when we had it in-house, then we went out, now we're back in.\"\nWhile the operational budget may not look different within the first year, Hickey emphasized, \"What we're doing is keeping that money in the county, and being able to prioritize and utilize local vendors which it cannot do right now,\" she said. By October, the district hopes to have a partnership with a local vendor in time for Homegrown School Week.\nIn addition to the cost savings, Board President Helen Bennet was particularly excited about the prospect of partnering with local farms, particularly for the benefit of FFA, and looked forward to updates as it moved forward.\nThe board's approval of the contract was necessary as the district needs to begin ordering food for summer programs and the start of next school year, Hickey said.\nIt was also noted, as the district shifts away from its current food service management company Sodexo, so too does its milk distributor service contract and the BOE approved piggybacking off of the MSEC milk contract with Cloverland Dairy.\nCloverland is QACPS's current milk provider through the Sodexo, so the approval just brings a different contract, Hickey said.\nPricing on half pints of regular milk are estimated to be better with the piggybacking contract, Hickey said.\nWicomico County Public Schools put the public bid out for milk delivery and the contract contains a piggyback clause for QACPS to jump on, she said.\nThe total price is expected to be $190,000 for the Fiscal Year 2025 and funding will come from the food service funding account, according to Hickey.\nAn established milk vendor is required as part of compliance with the national school lunch and breakfast programs and federal guidelines, she said.\nThe contract is in effect until June 2026 unless terminated early by Wicomico, which is unlikely, Hickey noted, as Clover Farm is one of the only dairies in the area that has K-12 compliant milk products and has been that way for some time.\nThe board will next meet June 5. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Nearly 300 Chesapeake College students celebrate graduation\n\n May 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 691\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS — Nearly 300 Chesapeake College students were cheered by friends and family as they received their diplomas on Wednesday during the spring graduation.Clifford Coppersmith, president of Chesapeake College, congratulated the graduates for their achievements in furthering their education. Coopersmith recounted his journey as a community college graduate over 40 years ago.\nIn his speech, he referenced two themes he wanted to share with the graduates: the first acknowledges the extraordinary times they are living through, and the second theme is the hope that the graduates embody.\n\"I wish to focus on all of you, our first cohort of students graduating with degrees and certificates that were impacted the most by the immediate and following effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Coppersmith said. \"You have persevered in the most difficult times we have seen as a nation in decades, and your decision to pursue your education, to quote a colleague of mine, Dr. David Harper, is a sign of hope, in and of itself.\"\nAn array of individuals were honored, including Rob Thompson, current director of arts for Chesapeake College, who received the 2024-2026 Bounds Distinguished Teaching Chair Award.\nIn Thompson's speech, he spoke of Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for president in 1872, and her dedication to her dream for a more equal society. He described her as a pioneer for women's rights.\n\"Woodhull never asked for permission to try and change the world or to embark on any of the careers she took up,\" Thompson said. \"She felt an injustice, she found a purpose, and she took action in as many ways as she could think of. For as long as she could stand, it would all be a national figure. But as her story shows, she was just as focused on changing conditions in her home as she was on the nation.\"\nThompson described the importance of shaping homes and communities and the power that adapting after failure has on people.\n\"That's not so much persisting as it is adapting and seeking an alternative,\" Thompson said. \"Chasing dreams requires that you travel down some dark and twisting trails. But you've got to keep searching. My student's dreams and their remarkable capacity to show up with creative minds and passionate hearts have carried me through this career. I'm talking about you guys.\"\nAfter Thompson's speech, Milton Nagel, vice chair of the Chesapeake College Board of Trustees, presented the John T. Harrison Award to Zulema Delacruz Martinez. The John T. Harrison Award is given each year to a student who has demonstrated the highest academic performance, leadership and overall contributions to the college and the community.\nDelacruz Martinez was praised for her commitment to Hispanic and Latino students within the region who are interested in college but may be intimidated by the academic process. She has organized several events to welcome the students and their families to complete college applications and sign up for resource services.\nDuring her speech, Delacruz Martinez recounted her childhood growing up in a nontraditional home and witnessing the extraordinary hard work that her mother had to do to provide for her and her brother.\n\"My mother overcame so many obstacles while making so many sacrifices. It was then, at the age of 8, that I vowed to do the same. I decided I would learn from her experience of having a front-row seat to my mother's hardships as she overcame her adversities. All of those experiences have pushed me to persevere.\"\nShe recounted the resources her advisers gave her and the many people who helped guide and support her to finish. During her time at Chesapeake College, she founded the Hispanic Latino Student Union, learned to be a leader and found her home there.\nToward the end of her speech, Delacruz Martinez praised her classmates and offered words of encouragement.\n\"Take advantage of every opportunity that comes your way. Build upon meaningful relationships with those around you and keep persevering as you keep persevering. Whether that be in your future college endeavors or in your day-to-day lives,\" Delacruz Martinez said. \"I leave you with this quote: 'To make a great dream a reality. The first requirement is a great capacity to dream. The second is persistence.'\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Graduation ceremonies held for local homeschool students\n\n May 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DOUG BISHOP | Section: News \n \n 805\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Saturday afternoon, May 18, students who have been homeschooled under the umbrella of Shore Christian Fellowship, were awarded diplomas. The ceremony was held inside Shore Christian Fellowship Church in Queenstown.Homeschool commencement programs have been held at the church for more than a decade. This year's graduating class of 10 is the largest class yet. Students in the Class of 2024 are: Cody Blunt, Ashlyn Boyles, Alyssa Jastram, Kylee Koss, Makayla Larson, Mason Patterson, and Hayden Winborne.\nLora Largent, Shore Christian Fellowship's homeschool umbrella coordinator for many years, made the arrangements for commencement program. All five of Largent's own children have graduated as homeschoolers.\nLargent said, \"There were three other students who were part of this year's class, but chose not to join us for the ceremony. So, we really have 10 graduates this year.\"\nAs part of the program, all seven graduates, individually, got up to the podium to speak, if to say nothing more than thank you to their parents for dedicating themselves to helping them with their educations. Each also selected a verse from the Bible they found impressive and meaningful in their lives. Those verses were shared in a power-point presentation prior to the graduation ceremony.\nSeveral of the parents also spoke at the podium, congratulating their child, and the other graduates.\nAs for future challenges, each graduate listed what's next in their lives. Cody plans on becoming an electrician and will embark on training to become a journeyman in that profession. Ashlyn has a late June wedding planned and will be attending River Bible Institute in Tampa, this fall. She is an accomplished ice skater which she's been doing since she was three. Alyssa will be attending the University of Kentucky this fall, majoring in Equine Business and Management with a minor in Communications. She will be a member of the UK Eventing Team, and hopes to earn a spot of the USA Olympic Equestrian Team. Kylee has many interests, hoping to teach and continue her passion with competitive dancing. Makayla who has been taking classes in dual enrollment at Chesapeake College, was the founder of the college's mental health club which currently has 28 members, and will be serving as Vice President of the college's SGA next semester. She plans to eventually earn her PhD in psychology. Mason will also be attending River Bible Institute in Tampa. Hayden plans to find a career in Cyber Security.\nOf the students who were interviewed, none of them said they felt they missed out on anything by transitioning to the homeschool program. Kylee said, \"I felt homeschool provided me with more opportunities than if I had stayed in regular school classes.\" Makayla added, \"I needed a more mature setting than what I found in school when I left to do homeschooling. I was still able to have my friends and socialize with them.\"\nMost of the homeschool student graduates started in public schools, but moved to homeschooling when the pandemic started. They decided to stay with homeschooling when the pandemic ended.\nTo conclude the commencement program, Pastor Tom Chandler provided \"a challenge\" to the graduates going forward with their lives. He said, \"I'm a homeschool parent. I understand the sacrifices that are made to do a homeschool program with your child. However, the benefits outweigh the sacrifices — we call that, investments in the future. You parents are to be commended for your commitment to your children's educations.\"\nHe continued, saying \"Jesus said, 'There is no greater sacrifice one can make than to give up their life to another. We all need to remember that in our own lives. Living a life that prioritizes selfless, loving sacrifice for others rather than living for self. Ultimately, living each day to the benefit of the next generation.\"\nHomeschool programs must be supervised by local public schools to ensure that students of all ages are truly receiving an education at home. Largent said, \"We, at Shore Christian Fellowship, serve as an 'umbrella' of the homeschool program. We help make sure parents are following the homeschool program as it is designed. We meet with parents, answer any questions, explain anything they might not understand. We make sure their children meet all the requirements to help their children get their education's properly. You can do it with our help, or do it yourself by going directly to the board of educations to file the proof of learning they are doing at home. Those filings must take place at least twice a year, if you want to do it yourself, rather than ask of help from us.\"\nLargent also said, \"We have more than 100 families registered in the homeschool program at Shore Christian Fellowship who we are helping. It's the most we've ever had.\"\nThere are other families within Queen Anne's County, who report directly to Queen Anne's County Public Schools who are not part of the SCF umbrella. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It started in California and now operates in 15 states.\nSchool nurses perform an initial vision screening on students and, on average, approximately one-third are referred for an eye exam by an optometrist.\nVision to Learn comes to the school and performs eye exams in a specially outfitted van. Kids who need glasses get to pick out their frames, and the nonprofit returns to deliver the glasses about a month later.\nOver the past decade, Vision to Learn has performed 20,000 eye exams in Delaware and provided 15,000 pairs of glasses – all free of charge. The effort is funded by donations, as well as billing Medicaid.\nAt Keene, County Executive Matt Meyer presented Vision to Learn with $100,000 from the county's share of the American Rescue Plan Act, enough to provide glasses to nearly 700 more kids.\nAnn Hollister, CEO of Vision to Learn, said it never gets old seeing kids receive their glasses.\n\"It's a little aha moment. So often kids tell us they didn't know the world looked like this,\" Hollister said. \"It's a special moment when they realize, 'Oh, I can see better.'\"\nOften, she added, parents don't realize their kids are struggling with their eyesight.\n\"If a child has a tummy ache, they might go home and tell a parent. But they don't know they can't see,\" Hollister said. \"At a young age, they just think that's what the world looks like.\"\nWhile school nurses have done vision screening for years, having Vision to Learn come to the school to do eye exams and fit kids for glasses is a huge convenience for parents, Taraboletti said.\n\"It's not even just the free glasses,\" she said. \"You don't have to take off work to go to the eye doctor, you don't have to then go back and pick up the glasses. People are busy, and it just makes it so much easier.\"\nBeing able to see properly helps kids do better in school, Hollister said.\n\"Studies show that it makes a profound difference in academic outcomes,\" she said. \"It's one of the most impactful interventions you can provide a child. Everything else works better if you can see.\"\nChristina School District Superintendent Dan Shelton concurred.\n\"A lot of times when we talk about accessibility, we talk about accessibility by access to programs and access to services and access to courses,\" Shelton said. \"But none of that stuff is very helpful if you can't see it.\"\nKeene fourth-grader David Pierre has worn glasses for a few years but was happy to receive a new pair with an updated prescription.\n\"All my other ones have scratches,\" Pierre said.\nAiden Onfroy, also a fourth-grader, was happy to have a new pair of glasses.\n\"The first pair of glasses I got, I still wore them but every couple seconds, I kept on squinting,\" Onfroy said. \"I can see way better.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Led by their teacher, students strategically manage their portfolio over a 10-week period, consistently buying and selling stocks, bonds and mutual funds in effort to increase their portfolio return.\nThe winning teams achieved the highest portfolio returns among student teams in their age group.\nEaston Middle School had winning teams in both the fall and spring regional competitions and a winning team in the fall state competition.\nThe teams were led by social studies teacher Edward Keeler.\n\"Congratulations to Mr. Keeler and his stock market savvy students for winning the MD State Stock Market Games sponsored by the MD Council on Economic Education,\" EMS said in a Facebook post following the awards ceremony. \"Fun fact: Mr. Keeler has led more students to victory and has won this event more often than any teacher in the State of Maryland. We are extremely impressed and are #PantherProud of all who participated and placed.\"\nThe fall regional winning team consisted of Wilmer Rodriguez Argueta, Javir Harrington and Gibson Taylor.\nThe spring regional winning team consisted of Jordan Langrell and Cameron Rodrigue.\nThe fall state winning team consisted of Caiden Sackett, Braden Streaker and Miles Fink.\nThe Stock Market Game competition gives students real-world experience in investing, challenging them to make decisions about the direction of markets, buying or selling stocks, and completing transactions online. With real-time portfolio statement updates, teams are able to see how their team ranks compared to others, as well as the current value of their stocks.\nThe Maryland Council on Economic Education offers the Stock Market Game to students and teachers throughout Maryland each fall and spring to provide education about stock markets, the American economic system and the global economy. Participants develop skills in math, language arts, research and critical thinking.\nTo learn more about the Stock Market Game, visit www.econed.org/page-18321. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Carlson, a decorated veteran and member of the Elks, moved with quiet precision to attach the flag and hoist it. The two men worked together. This was not their first rodeo.\nFeehley takes veterans of all military branches into the schools to teach the kids a simple message — thank you for your service.\n\"I really think that from after the Korean War, even though this country was in a few conflicts, to when the Gulf War started, veterans were lost in the shuffle,\" Feehley said. \"Nobody gave them any recognition that I think a veteran deserves.\"\nHe is reminded of a famous saying: \"All gave some and some gave all.\"\n\"That all gave some is what I try to impart, which is why I started what we call a teach-in at the schools,\" Feehley said.\nAt Easton Elementary School, he teaches that veterans are all around us.\n\"The veteran is their school bus driver. A veteran may be their teacher. A veteran is their mom or dad or sister, their brother, the next-door neighbor,\" Feehley said.\nSome veterans have a different rhythm than 9 to 5 workers. When it is time to serve, they go.\n\"But that veteran also was away from their family for a long time,\" he said.\nHe and his team teach that some veterans have a tough time when they get back.\n\"That veteran sometimes didn't have the same advantages they have today. They might not be able to take a shower for more than a week. They might not have had any opportunities to watch television or to listen to the radio,\" Feehley said.\nHe teaches that the veterans' families can go through loss.\n\"The veteran's family had to do without their dad or their brother or their uncle or their cousin at the table or the family reunions,\" Feehley said.\nHe tells students not to take the liberties they have for granted.\n\"They have the choice of what TV show to watch. They have the choice of whether to pack your lunch or get it at school. To have the choice of what clothes you are wearing today. If it wasn't for a veteran, you might not have those choices,\" Feehley said.\nSo how should his students and the public engage with vets when we see them? What can be said?\n\"When you are walking through the parking lot and you see a car that has a Coast Guard sticker on the bumper and you see the driver simply say, 'Thank you,' and they will know exactly what you are talking about,\" Feehley said.\nHe says the young students are enthusiastic and engaged. He has members from each of the armed forces for each session where he acts as the moderator.\n\"I direct the question to a particular veteran. When the kids, who are in school, leave (our program) they are smiling. They can't get enough. When the assembly is over, they still want to interact with the veterans up on the stage. Fifth graders, fourth graders,\" he said.\nIt is not a recruiting effort. It is a lesson in gratitude.\nHe does what he does to remind people.\n\"Everybody who served in the armed forces gave something. Here is how we make your life a little better every day. Better than perhaps what it could have been. The kids love it. The teachers love it. The veterans hope they can come back next year,\" Feehley said.\n\"I think the best part is to try and let the kids know what a veteran is and why to say, 'Thank you.'\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Embrace uncertainty, Joe Flacco tells University of Delaware graduates\n\n May 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: Colleges \n \n 857\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As he progressed through his football career, Joe Flacco figured that by the time he reached the greatest heights of his profession, he would have finally figured out how to overcome his own self-doubt and fear of failure.But in 2013, when he \"climbed the mountain,\" as he put it, leading the Baltimore Ravens to a Super Bowl victory and being crowned the MVP, the quarterback realized he still had a lot to learn.\n\"The UD motto, 'knowledge is the light of the mind,' made a whole lot more sense,\" Flacco told University of Delaware graduates. \"For the first time, I figured out that I had been searching for the wrong thing the whole time. I had been trying to figure out how to eliminate the uncertainty, but really, I should have been trying to figure out how to embrace it.\"\nOn Saturday morning, Flacco returned to Delaware Stadium, where he set 20 school records and led the Blue Hens to an appearance in the national championship in 2007, to give the commencement address.\nKeeping with his \"Joe Cool\" reputation, Flacco gave a measured speech, showing little emotion and steering far clear of any controversy.\nHe told the newly minted graduates that during every step of his career — high school, the University of Pittsburgh, UD and the NFL — he always came in wondering if he would measure up.\nThose feelings of uncertainty piled up even more later in his career as he struggled in Baltimore and was ultimately traded to the Broncos and then the Eagles and Jets, where he saw limited playing time.\n\"Through it all, I held onto the knowledge that failure was OK as long as I learned from it and got back out there to try again and execute,\" Flacco said. \"It didn't matter if it was coming back after making a bad throw or waiting for my next chance to play. As long as I could embrace uncertainty, thus getting rid of the fear, I could find peace and set my mind to the task at hand instead of worrying about the uncertainty.\"\nLast fall, for the first time in his NFL career, Flacco found himself starting the season on his couch, wondering if any team would sign him. Finally, Cleveland came calling, and Flacco experienced a career resurgence when he led the Browns to the playoffs.\nFlacco said he appreciated the time he got to spend with family, preparing himself to make the most of any chance that he got.\n\"I had put the work in and embraced the uncertainty, and win or lose, I felt a sense of satisfaction with the whole experience,\" he said. \"I was only able to do that because of the relationships I had built and their love and commitment surrounding me, coupled with the experience and knowledge I had gained in embracing uncertainty to my advantage.\"\nFlacco told the graduates to lean on their family and friends for support, work hard to prepare for whatever challenge they face and accept that success may take a while.\n\"Failure is OK as long as you learn from it,\" he said.\nFlacco also made sure to answer what he says is the most common question he gets: What was it like to play with Ray Lewis?\n\"One of the coolest things about playing with him was getting to watch him come out of the tunnel,\" Flacco said. \"And even cooler than watching him was turning my attention to the visiting sideline and seeing all of their jaws on the turf.\"\nHe noted that he grew up idolizing players like Lewis and Ed Reed but assumed that anyone with that big of a personality and reputation for toughness on the field would be mean and unwelcoming.\n\"I couldn't have been more wrong,\" he said. \"I realized that they were not only really good football players, but they were also really good men. These guys were tough, had seen a lot and respected hard work.\"\nFlacco had quite a few fans in the crowd Saturday, including graduating seniors Jake DeMilta, Jordan Haft and Holden Morelli, who were all sitting in the front row wearing Flacco's #5 jersey instead of their graduation gowns.\n\"He's the greatest player in school history,\" DeMilta said.\nMorelli was wearing Flacco's Jets jersey instead of the more common Ravens or UD jerseys.\n\"I've got to be the only person with this in the whole country,\" he said, laughing.\nUD President Dennis Assanis told the 6,149 members of the Class of 2024 they should be proud of their hard work over the past four years.\n\"Perhaps you have not yet been named Super Bowl MVP like Joe,\" Assanis said. \"But you have all certainly accomplished so much during your time at the University of Delaware.\"\nHe told graduates that, in a time of great disruption by artificial intelligence and other technological advances, they should never underestimate the power of empathy, compassion and human understanding.\n\"The personal and unique moments that inspire, excite or motivate us, the moments that make us cry, laugh, love and care, and our shared feelings and thoughts, as members of this special campus community, truly define the human experience,\" he said. \"I hope you will always remember that human connection is precious and irreplaceable.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Shelly was part of the Terrapin Program through Maryland Environmental Service, the agency heading up the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island.\nAs part of the research program, Shelly spent her first year growing from a tiny hatchling to a young terrapin at Kent County Middle School before being release back on Poplar Island.\nFor Copeland, this was his first time raising a terrapin, an experience he described as \"amazing.\"\n\"Not only was it truly great for the students to learn more about terrapin ecology and physiology, it was also a good opportunity for students to learn about the environmental impacts we as humans impose on literally our backyard, the Chesapeake Bay,\" Copeland said.\nCawthorne said she loved every minute helping raise Shelly and was very thankful for the experience.\n\"Seeing the look of awe and excitement in the students' faces whenever Shelly made her way to my classroom was nothing short of wonderful. The students learned so much about terrapins and we were very sad to see her go,\" Cawthorne said.\nFor more than a decade, the State of Maryland has been rebuilding Poplar Island.\nIn its day, there were families that called Polar Island home. It also hosted a getaway used by the most powerful people in Washington, D.C., including U.S. presidents like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman.\nThe waters of the Chesapeake eroded Poplar Island so much so that by 2000, it was predicted the entire island would soon be washed away.\nThe Poplar Island restoration site is still under construction. While no people live on the island, many species of wildlife now call it home — or at least a stop on their migratory route.\nScientists led by biologist Willem Roosenburg at Ohio University are conducting a study of terrapins on Poplar Island. They locate nests and count and measure eggs.\n\"A lack of land predators, undisturbed sandy shorelines, and a variety of habitat types make Poplar an ideal terrapin nesting site,\" the Terrapin Program website states.\nWith around 800 diamondback terrapins — the state reptile of Maryland — hatching annually on Poplar Island, the researchers collect about 150 eggs each year and give the juveniles to schools raise.\nThis \"head start\" program aims to determine if this level of human involvement in terrapins' early stages of life gives them a better chance in the long run of surviving in the nature world, according to the Terrapin Program site.\nIt also gives students the opportunity to more personally engage with the Bay's ecosystem.\n\"Through this program, students are playing an important role in relevant, cutting-edge research focused on the conservation of the species,\" the Terrapin Program site states. \"The combination of scientific applications, hands-on involvement and the emotional attachment to the terrapins provides a unique opportunity to inspire a meaningful connection with the Chesapeake Bay.\"\nThrough releasing Shelly back into the wild, Cawthorne and Copeland both said they hope the middle school students learned that any action they take, no matter how large or small, can have a huge impact on the health of the Bay.\nThe field trip was funded in part by the Kent County Public Schools Education Foundation Fund.\nPart of Mid-Shore Community Foundation, the education foundation fund helps cover the costs of extended field trips, provides mini-grants to teachers and more.\nFor details about the Kent County Public Schools Education Foundation Fund, or to make a donation, visit www.kent.k12.md.us/Foundation.aspx. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — On Wednesday evening, the community supported 63 students from St. Michaels High School as they received their diplomas.Senior Class President Madi White welcomed the students' loved ones and congratulated the Class of 2024 for their accomplishments. In her speech, she expressed the hardships that her class had endured to get to graduation.\n\"The faces, the smiles, the tears, they all represent a journey of great memories and unforgettable hardships,\" White said. \"Four years, 1461 days and 35,064 hours … That number didn't feel real because it's hard to believe that we spent a kajillion seconds waiting for this moment ... Before we dive headfirst into our ceremony, we must acknowledge how we got here. Our support system was none other than the best.\"\nAt the end of her speech, White reminded her classmates that they are not facing the future alone but with that robust support system.\nAfter the welcome speech, graduate Will Bridges presented the mantel, a time-honored tradition at St. Michaels High School. Bridges then passed the mantle over to Lexi Rockwell, president of the junior class.\n\"It is a symbol of all the ideals and principles for which our school stands and a badge of seniority,\" Bridges said. \"Tonight, we must surrender the club to the class of 2025. We hereby give the honor, place, privilege and responsibility to live up to the lofty ideals of which the garment is a symbol. I say to you, take it, love it.\"\nNathan Henckel gave the valedictorian address. In his speech, he expressed the excitement that his class had in anticipation of this day. Henckel quoted Hannah Montana, referring to her as \"one of the most influential icons of our time.\"\n\"'Of course, I always knew this day would come; we'd be standing one by one with the future in our hands, so many dreams, so many plans,'\" Henckel said. \"Yet, despite being in this room right now, with all of our future plans set, we cannot ignore how this journey began.\"\nHe expressed the difficulties of losing a part of his education journey to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Henckel said that as he reflected on his high school years, he found that his teacher, Lauren Greer, had encouraged and uplifted him.\n\"Whether I needed to ask the question about the stem from protein synthesis, have an email proofread, or simply needed a space to vibe..., 547 was always a place for me,\" Henckel said. \"It's because of teachers like this that I feel extremely prepared for all my future endeavors.\"\nTalbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi, an alumnus of St. Michaels High School, congratulated the class. Pepukayi advised the graduates to appreciate this time in their lives and to do as their chosen class motto said: \"Just keep swimming.\"\n\"Be an example, inspire others, use your talents and gifts, bring it around, take everything in this evening,\" Pepukayi said. \"Because soon enough, you'll be back in the race ... Congratulations. Best of luck, no matter if you breaststroke, sidestroke, butterfly or doggy paddle. Just keep swimming.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The students sitting before you tonight have exemplified resilience more than any of us adults have before the age of 18. They have had musicals canceled, sports seasons cut short, dances canceled, and couldn't find sustainable employment during the pandemic. But I can tell you one thing….these kids came out on top! I don't want to focus on what they have lost tonight, but rather what they have gained.\"\nIt was noted that this class rose above COVID their freshman year, earned $14,095,882 in scholarships and completed over 37,291 service learning hours.\nTCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi came up to the lectern in a green robe.\n\"I am humbled to serve a little over 4,500 students but for this evening we are focusing on these 278 students that will soon become Easton High Warrior alumni,\" Pepukayi said. \"... Be great and make mistakes. Fail forward again and again. Dare to learn something new.\"\nValedictorian Iven Chen stood up from his chair and addressed the audience and his fellow Warriors. He remembered losing the whole first year to COVID and not even coming to campus. But the proper rhythm was restored as the four years went by.\n\"If you're like me, you'll worry about not making enough memories once you realize your time is almost over. You feel the urge to make the most of your lasts as they start piling up: your last year, your last homecoming, your last game, your last prom, all leading up to your last day,\" Chen said.\nHe hit a funny and poignant note about life's choices as they become adults.\n\"If there's one thing you should take away from this, it's that you have the ability to pursue your own path. You've done this before when navigating the maze of high school, and you can definitely do it again. Heck, if there are too many walls in your way, just be like the Kool-Aid man and bust your way through them,\" Chen said.\nThe salutatorian was Sabin Long, who said he noticed how time passing had changed him, ultimately helping him reach this moment of graduation.\n\"Wherever you all are going in the next part of your life, I hope the community there welcomes you the way the community here has welcomed me — the way you all have welcomed me,\" Long said.\nSenior Class President Colin Smith and TCPS Board Member and Senior Class Executive President Samantha Jessee also addressed the packed auditorium.\nSmith said, \"Take this opportunity to break the pattern. Run that race, take that trip, make that new friend. We only have one opportunity to live our lives. We only live once, and there are no second chances.\"\nJessee said, \"Being captain of the cheer team allowed my passion for school spirit to thrive. EHS has laid out the blueprint for our successes, making conquering and achieving our dreams more than obtainable. In the words of Elvis Presley, you've gotta follow that dream, wherever that dream may lead.\"\nThen it was time for the diplomas to be handed out. Dr. Pepukayi and Emily Jackson, president of the Talbot County Board of Education, handed out 287 diplomas.\nAfter every one was honored, they turned their tassels and threw their caps in the air. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He asked that as they follow their hearts, they remember to serve from their hearts too.\n\"I know personally that the people of North Dorchester love and care about others,\" he said. \"Fourteen years ago, my son went to the hospital in Baltimore for a bone marrow transplant. And my wife and I did not know whether or not he would survive. Spoiler alert: he did.\"\nAlbert said the NDHS staff and students carried him through this time.\n\"For that service (from the heart) is what makes people and organizations and nations great,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He talked about a student who, over the last four years, went from not attending class, to arguing with Tucker to calling Tucker the reason they come to school every day.\n\"There were a lot of times that I didn't want to get up and come to school, but I thought (about) what you told me,\" Tucker said about the student. \"And it inspired me to get here. Maybe not on time, but I got here.\"\nThe graduation ceremony brought tears and laughter on Thursday evening. Along with the speeches, the CSD chorus performed \"I Lived\" by OneRepublic, and the students, along with some staff and administration members, performed \"Don't Stop Believin'\" by Journey and \"The Time of My Life\" by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now, it's your time to shine.\"\nThis year's valedictorian is Ben Loller, who will be heading to prestigious Brown University this fall to study computer science. The salutatorian is Madison Messick; she earned a full ride to the University of Maryland, College Park.\nThose are just two of the many accomplishments Hemstetter listed.\nThere were increased numbers of students who achieved dual-completer status for finishing a Career and Technical Education pathway, of students taking Advanced Placement classes and exams, of students earning dual enrollment credits through classes at Chesapeake College and Washington College and so much more.\nLooking to their immediate future plans, 70% of the class will be attending a two- or four-year college or trade school, 26% of the class will be entering the workforce and 4% have enlisted in the military.\n\"As you venture into new territories — be it college, careers, workforce, military or other pursuits — never forget the power of your authenticity,\" Hemstetter told the class. \"It's your genuine self that will open doors, forge connections and create lasting impact.\"\nDr. Karen Couch, superintendent of Kent County Public Schools, offered her remarks in a video message. She was attending her grandson's high school graduation in Howard County.\nCouch spoke about the immense pride and enthusiasm she has for the graduating seniors, many of whom she has known since she arrived in Kent County at the start of their second-grade year.\n\"Graduates, as you stand on the threshold of new beginnings, remember the journey that brought each one of you here today,\" she said. \"With those first uncertain steps in our hallways to this moment of time, you have demonstrated resilience, passion and dedication to excellence.\"\nCouch said the class of 2024 \"embodies the best of our values: integrity, resiliency and a commitment to learning.\"\n\"You're not just graduates, you are the future, ready to make your mark on the world,\" she said. \"My heartiest of congratulations goes out to the Class of 2024. May your futures be bright, your lives full of joy and your contributions meaningful.\"\nThis year's graduation speaker was Darius Johnson, a member of the KCHS class of 2011 and now the Digital Justice Fellow at Washington College's Starr Center for the Study if the American Experience.\nHe spoke to the students about the importance of finding their own paths to success. He said that if he had followed other people's vision of success, he wouldn't be happy.\n\"In this next chapter, each of you must define what success means for you,\" he said. \"Write your plans in pencil, embrace change and walk with certainty, even if people doubt you, or if you doubt yourself. I'm here to tell you that you'll be alright.\"\nIn addition to being salutatorian, Messick has served as a student member of the Kent County Board of Education and the Citizen Advisory Committee as well as in the Maryland Student Page Program of General Assembly.\nShe spoke about how the Class of 2024 \"navigated through a whirlwind of experiences, challenges and triumphs\" and persevered in the face of hardships.\nShe said each member of the class has unique talents and urged them to use those \"to build a future that reflects the values of compassion, empathy and equality.\"\n\"May your futures be as bold and brilliant as the people I know you are today,\" Messick told her classmates. \"Together, let us continue to change the world by simply being ourselves.\"\nLoller, who among his extra-curricular activities also has served on the Citizen Advisory Committee and been a member of the KCHS Coding Team, used a metaphor about three skiers in his speech.\nHe said the first skier is focused on the trees and ice patches — the obstacles in the way to success. For the second skier, he said it is all about the path. He said the third skier failed to set the alarm and never made it to the mountain.\n\"I believe there have been times when we could all relate to him,\" Loller quipped.\nHe encouraged his classmates to be like the second skier, saying that by focusing on the path they will naturally overcome the obstacles and hardships along the way.\n\"Stay focused on your goals, stay focused on the destination, stay focused on your experiences. And keep your path forever clear,\" Loller said.\nClass of 2024 Secretary Jessica Rosanova served as the hostess of ceremonies. Jaeda Hoxter, class of 2024 vice president, introduced the platform guests. Guadalupe Duarte Arellano, Student Government Association president, gave the Senior Welcome and Ryan Myers, class of 2024 president, delivered the Message to Seniors. Class Historian Melissa Landon introduced Johnson as the guest speaker.\nCapping off the commencement ceremony, SGA Secretary Addisyn Litton led her classmates through the turning of their class rings and tassels, announcing them as graduates of KCHS.\nAs parents and family members and teachers, staff and administrators cheered, mortarboards went flying into the air and the class of 2024 showed their 24-karat shine, celebrating their graduation from Kent County High School. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County talks Blueprint with MACo\n\n June 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 776\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Maryland Association of Counties President Johnny Olszewski told the Dorchester County Council at a council meeting June 4 that Dorchester County is not alone in \"feeling the pinch\" from the Blueprint for Maryland's Future requirements.\"It's large counties too,\" said Olszewski, who is also the county executive for Baltimore County and the Democratic nominee Maryland's 2nd congressional district. \"I think we're seeing, every year, a few more jurisdictions of varying sizes as sort of hitting that point where it's like 'Oh man, how are we going to actually make this all work?'\"\nAt the June 4 meeting, which Olszewski and MACo Executive Director Michael Sanderson attended to present on the association's efforts and hear from the county, council members talked about their concerns with being able to fund Blueprint.\nBlueprint is a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state through increasing education funding by $3.8 billion over a 10 year period.\n\"I'm not against education, I'm not against teachers,\" council member Ricky Travers said. \"I want to see the kids get a great education. But is throwing money at it going to do it?\"\nTravers said that funding the Blueprint requirements is forcing the county to strip its other services.\n\"They want to buy a Lamborghini on a Toyota budget, and they want to pay for it in a really short time,\" he said.\nSanderson told the council that it's not lost on him that income taxes and property taxes are the main revenue sources for county governments. He said that because two-thirds of Marylanders are at the \"absolute cap\" on the income tax, property taxes are the only way counties are going to be able to pay for their share of the Blueprint.\n\"It's exactly the wrong way to try and fund it,\" Sanderson said. \"Even if you're a big fan of the progressive policies in the Blueprint.\"\nThose policies include expanding full-day pre-K for children in families with incomes up to 300% of the federal poverty line, increasing teacher starting salaries to $60,000 by 2026, implementing a new college and career readiness standard and increasing funding for special education and multilingual learner students.\nIn November, MACo sent a letter to Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson and Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne Jones writing that \"in many ways,\" the Blueprint is a one-size-fits-all approach to investing in education in a state with \"diverse local government capacities, processes and abilities.\"\nThe letter says that record county funding and additional mandated funding for Blueprint will make it difficult for counties to fund other things in their jurisdiction.\nIn the letter, MACo makes a variety of requests — including a more comprehensive cost analysis of the Blueprint, an increase in state aid for the renovation and construction of pre-K facilities and more time for the development of educator career ladder models — to ensure the Blueprint's success.\nAt the meeting, council member Rob Kramer pointed out that 72% of Dorchester County is considered critical area, like wetlands, and cannot be built on. He said that under the new critical areas map, that percentage will increase to 78%. With only so much space that can be built on, how much the county's property tax revenues, which pay for Blueprint requirements, can increase without raising taxes is limited.\n\"We're a small county and we basically rely on property taxes to operate,\" Kramer said. \"So that makes it tough on the ones that do own property here.\"\nCouncil member William Nichols said he refuses to raise taxes on seniors. He said their are a lot of seniors in his district, and they can't afford higher taxes.\nDuring his presentation to the council, Sanderson brought up the Cade Funding Formula for community colleges, which received a reduction from the state for fiscal year 2025, and highway user revenues, which Sanderson said could receive cuts in the future.\nOlszewski said talked about how this affects counties, especially when they have to meet Blueprint requirements.\n\"It sort of becomes, well we can't fund community colleges and roads and all the other things and meet their obligations,\" he said about the Blueprint requirements.\nSanderson said that for any county governing body that doesn't meet Blueprint requirements, its county income taxes will be sent directly to the schools, rather than to the county.\nAt the end of the conversation, Olszewski talked about the importance of facilitating these conversations between MACo and Maryland counties.\n\"They're so helpful because they us sort of inform the legwork (we're) heading into,\" he said. \"And it's already sounding like Blueprint is going to be another major issue that we are going to be taking up in the year ahead.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'He snapped': Maryland teacher sentenced to probation for assaulting doorbell pranksters\n\n June 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1555\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A Rising Sun High School teacher who has served as an educator for 30 years received a suspended six-month sentence and was placed on 15 months of supervised probation Wednesday, after pleading guilty to assaulting a 13-year-old boy after the child and a friend pranked him at his residence.The defendant, Dylan M. Aiman, 54, of Rising Sun, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault, a misdemeanor that is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. In exchange, prosecutors dismissed related charges of reckless endangerment and false imprisonment.\nCecil County District Court Administrative Judge Bonnie G. Schneider rejected a defense request to grant Aiman probation-before-judgement, commonly known as a PBJ — a verdict in which the presiding judge finds the defendant guilty and then sets aside the conviction, meaning the conviction will not appear on that person's record.\nA PBJ reportedly would have been more favorable for Aiman when the Cecil County Public Schools administration decides on his future employment.\nAssistant State's Attorney Joseph Verratti told the judge that he would not object to Aiman receiving a PBJ.\nAiman's defense lawyer, Thomas C. Morrow of Towson, told the judge that Aiman is on administrative leave, a status that school officials assigned Aiman shortly after a Rising Sun Police Department officer filed criminal charges against him in the wake of the early-May incident.\nJoseph Buckley, who is the CCPS associate superintendent for administrative services, told the Cecil Whig on Thursday, \"We are aware of the legal matter that's facing one of our employees and we're going to follow all of our human resources processes to access the situation to address the matter. We'll be working with the employee to address the matter. Other than that, at this point, we really have no further comment.\"\nBuckley noted that CCPS officials are not at liberty to release specific information concerning personnel matters.\nFrom the bench, Schneider opined Wednesday that a PBJ verdict would not be appropriate because, according to information provided by the prosecution, Aiman was convicted of failure to obey a peace order in 2012, some 12 years ago. (Aiman reportedly had been granted a PBJ in that 2012 case, which stemmed from a dispute with a neighbor, and he violated the peace order when he entered his neighbor's yard to retrieve as Nerf lawn dart that his son had shot onto that property.)\nElecting to still accept the plea deal, knowing that the judge would not grant him a PBJ, Aiman pleaded guilty to second-degree assault. Then, after Verratti read aloud the statement of facts, Schneider found Aiman guilty of that offense and imposed a suspended six-month sentence on him. (Verratti had recommended a suspended one-year sentence, one year of supervised probation, an anger management class and no contact with the victims in the proffered plea agreement.)\nIn addition, the judge ordered Aiman to serve 15 months of supervised probation. Schneider acknowledged that Aiman already had successfully completed an anger management class since the incident occurred. The judge, however, ordered Aiman to take another anger management course if his probation officer deems that it is necessary.\nThe judge also ordered Aiman to have no contact with the two victims, one of whom turned 14 about three weeks after the incident.\nMoments before sentencing, Aiman stood at the defense table, reflected on the incident and told the judge, \"I clearly way overreacted.\"\nHis words echoed ones uttered moments earlier by Morrow, who reported that Aiman has an unblemished employment record during his 30 years as an educator, the last 24 of which in Cecil County, and that he is a RSHS biology teacher, one who teaches predominantly honors classes, in addition to that subject at other levels.\nMorrow advocated for an outcome in the criminal case that might result in the \"salvaging of his (Aiman's) career.\"\nTHE INCIDENT\nAiman chased the two boys in the early evening of May 4, which was a Saturday, after they rang the doorbell at his residence in the 200 block of Turtleneck Court and ran away — a prank known as \"ding dong ditch.\"\nAfter catching the teens across the street from his home, Aiman forced them back to his front porch, where he made the boys wait for police officers to respond after calling authorities and making a harassment complaint, according to court records.\nRSPD Pfc. Cunningham and Patrolman Moore responded to the scene at 7:32 p.m., and Aiman told them that he \"gripped one up,\" referring to one of the teens. Aiman maintained that he gave chase after the second time that the ding-dong-ditch prank had been pulled at his residence that evening.\nIn the courtroom Wednesday, the prosecutor reported that Aiman grabbed one of the boys by his sweatshirt, lifted him up by the garment and kneed him in the ribs. Verratti also reported that Aiman handled the situation in \"an aggressive manner,\" which included him yelling at the boys.\nCunningham informed Aiman that \"he could not put his hands on juveniles and that it does classify as an assault,\" according to court records.\n\"(Aiman) did not seem to understand, asking what he was supposed to do — let them run away. (Aiman) continually stated that he just held the kids on his front porch until the police arrived,\" court records show.\nAiman did not know the boys, who live in his neighborhood, according to the defense.\nInvestigators filed charges of second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and false imprisonment against Aiman on May 5, a day after the incident, and served him the criminal summons on May 6, court records show. He was released on personal recognizance.\n'HE SNAPPED'\nMorrow maintained that the incident was an aberration.\nHe reported that Aiman served as a soccer coach for RSHS boys and girls teams and as a coach for Cecil County Department of Parks and Recreation youth soccer teams, in addition to his 30-year career as a teacher, and that he received no official complaints.\nThe defense lawyer also told the judge that Aiman and his family have been the target of harassment in the Rising Sun community by unknown people for an unspecified long time, with encroachments including people hurling eggs at the Aiman house — which required professional cleaning — and cars and placing \"anonymous threats in his mailbox.\".\nAiman reported those incidents to police \"multiple times\" in the past, but nothing was done, Morrow said. Officers told Aiman that it would be difficult for law enforcement to take action unless he was able to identify the culprit or culprits, he added.\n(Speculating on why Aiman was harassed, Morrow told the judge that Aiman is \"a good teacher\" who teaches biology at a high level, which can be difficult and frustrating for students. Aside from the two boys who admitted to playing the May 4 ding-dong-ditch prank at Aiman's home, however, no one has been identified as a perpetrator of the previous purported pranks and harassment directed at him and his family.)\nAiman caught the teens and held them on his porch until officers arrived because he wanted parents and authorities involved, according to Morrow.\n\"It was not his intent to injure anyone,\" Morrow said, stressing that Aiman told one of the boys, \"I want you to call your father right now,\" after escorting the teens to his porch.\n\"His only intent was to get some kind of parental involvement to end this trend of harassment,\" Morrow said.\nThe defense lawyer also emphasized that Aiman is \"facing potential dismissal and the loss of his teaching certificate\" after 30 years as an educator.\nAiman's wife spoke on his behalf, telling the judge that her husband's action on May 4 was uncharacteristic. She blamed his response on the frustration and weariness of enduring pranks and various types of harassment over the years. She and Aiman have been married for 24 years.\nShe opined that a family's home should feel like \"a safe place,\" one that provides \"peace, a respite,\" before maintaining that the prolonged harassment had eroded her family's sense of tranquility and that the ding-dong-ditch prank on May 4 pushed her husband to his limit.\n\"He snapped. He had enough,\" Aiman's wife said.\nShe commented, \"He's a great man, a loving father and a great husband . . . He's remorseful and sick about it (the incident).\"\nAiman, who has six children, apologized to the two victims, their families, his own family, the school system and county parks and recreation moments before sentencing.\n\"I let all of them down, including myself,\" Aiman said. \"I worked with kids to give them a positive experience in the classroom and on the soccer field.\"\nHe also alluded to the question hanging over his career in education, remarking, \"Teaching is very important to me.\"\nA LEVEL OF LEADERSHIP\nThe father of the boy whom Aiman picked up and kneed in the ribs told the judge that he was surprised when he learned that Aiman was a teacher.\n\"He's trained to deal with kids, to show a level of leadership. He should be someone to look up to,\" the father said. \"It's concerning to me that this man is employed by the school.\"\nThe mother of the other boy also addressed the judge. She acknowledged that, although Aiman did not aggressively touch her son to the level that he did to her son's friend, the interaction with Aiman negatively impacted her son. She contended that Aiman yelled threateningly.\nAccording to the woman, her son was afraid to walked into a store by himself one day after the incident. \"I'm concerned how quickly he went into anger,\" she said of Aiman. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Children struggling to read (for any reason), can request a session with a canine and handler at the library. It is proven that canines open many doors for children struggling emotionally and physically. Children feel comfortable with a canine. Canines break down barriers, do not judge, are fluffy, motivate and create trust.I have been visiting special needs classrooms in Talbot and Queen Anne's counties, as well as hospitals, nursing homes, physical therapy centers, doctors' offices and psychological sessions since 2012 with my canines. I have had four canines, all female rottweilers, approved as therapy dogs. My current dog, and previous dog, were members of Alliance of Therapy Dogs and Crisis Response Canines.\nThe requirements for both groups are strict. Dogs and handlers have a background check and must pass handling tests. My dogs are desensitized to loud noises, children yelling, falling on them, sirens, etc. They are obedient and trust me. My dogs have over 1,000 visits, and have earned National Recognition for their Therapy Work.\nLast August, I set up my calendar with visits to seven classrooms at Easton Elementary School, for the September-December session. A few weeks before the session began, I was forwarded a letter by one of the teachers, saying that no dogs were allowed at school. My first thought was that this decision would hurt the many children we help.\nI never received any updates. Nothing. After a few months, I was told (anonymously) that the decision was based on \"policy change,\" I was told Jovie and I would be back in classrooms before 2024. Not to be. It is now too late in the school year to start visiting classrooms. I'm not sure if, or when we will be allowed back in Talbot County Public Schools.\nIn 12 years, my dogs have never had an issue. We have excellent insurance coverage through our therapy groups. We do all of this without compensation. We do this for the children. I am deeply saddened by this. I can't believe this would happen in Talbot County. My hope is that we will be back visiting children in need, at Easton Elementary School, next September.\nBARBARA LEE JEFFERSON\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "High school teacher guilty of assault on prankster\n\n June 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 490\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ELKTON — A 30-year Rising Sun High School teacher received a suspended six-month sentence and was placed on 15 months of supervised probation Wednesday, after pleading guilty to assaulting a 13-year-old boy after the child and a friend pranked him at his residence.The defendant, Dylan M. Aiman, 54, of Rising Sun, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault, a misdemeanor that is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. In exchange, prosecutors dismissed related charges of reckless endangerment and false imprisonment.\nAiman's defense lawyer, Thomas C. Morrow of Towson, told the judge that Aiman is on administrative leave, a status that school officials assigned Aiman shortly after a Rising Sun Police Department officer filed criminal charges against him in the wake of the early-May incident.\nJoseph Buckley, who is the Cecil County Public Schools associate superintendent for administrative services, told the Cecil Whig on Thursday that the situation is under review.\n\"We are aware of the legal matter that's facing one of our employees, and we're going to follow all of our human resources processes to access the situation to address the matter,\" he said. \"We'll be working with the employee to address the matter. Other than that, at this point, we really have no further comment.\"\nAiman chased the two boys in the early evening of May 4, which was a Saturday, after they rang the doorbell at his residence in the 200 block of Turtleneck Court and ran away — a prank known as \"ding dong ditch.\"\nAfter catching the teens across the street from his home, Aiman forced them back to his front porch, where he made the boys wait for police officers to respond after calling authorities and making a harassment complaint, according to court records.\nOfficers responded to the scene at 7:32 p.m., and Aiman told them that he \"gripped one up,\" referring to one of the teens. Aiman maintained that he gave chase after the second time that the ding-dong-ditch prank had been pulled at his residence that evening.\nIn the courtroom Wednesday, Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Verratti reported that Aiman grabbed one of the boys by his sweatshirt, lifted him up by the garment and kneed him in the ribs. Verratti said that Aiman handled the situation in \"an aggressive manner,\" which included him yelling at the boys.\nPolice informed Aiman that \"he could not put his hands on juveniles and that it does classify as an assault,\" according to court records.\n\"(Aiman) did not seem to understand, asking what he was supposed to do — let them run away. (Aiman) continually stated that he just held the kids on his front porch until the police arrived,\" court records show.\nAiman did not know the boys, who live in his neighborhood, according to the defense.\nInvestigators filed charges of second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and false imprisonment against Aiman on May 5, a day after the incident, and served him the criminal summons on May 6, court records show. He was released on personal recognizance. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Students are chosen according to the practices of their individual schools and are responsible for providing information about activities and events occurring at their school and the elementary and middle schools in their area.\nSimmons introduced both students and their extensive leadership roles and accomplishments.\nOdidika is a senior at Colonel Richardson High School. She is treasurer of the Straight Gay Alliance, a member of the National Honor Society and the Technical Honor Society, and a member of the LEO Club, orchestra and chorus.\nAfter graduation, Odidika plans to be a pediatric emergency physician.\nBelle is a junior at North Caroline High School. She is treasurer of the class of 2026, as well as treasurer of the Student Government Association, student ambassador for the Maryland Business Roundtable, co-director of the Regional Policy Director of the Eastern Shore of Maryland AYA and a member of TRIO Upward Bound. She is involved in the intensive law trial program at Stanford University and plans to study law after graduation.\nSimmons described the students as outstanding representatives of their schools and said he looked forward to the leadership they will bring as student representatives to the board.\n\"We are thrilled to have you guys, and we're looking forward to a great year together next year, so thank you all for being here tonight,\" Simmons said. \"This is the only night where you won't be sitting up here at a table for a while and contributing and being a part of it, but we are thrilled to have you here tonight and being able to come out.\"\nA former student representative was in the crowd as well, and she advised Odidika and Belle to take time to visit the other schools, including the elementary and middle schools in the county. She also encouraged them to check out any events happening in those schools and engage with the community so they have a better understanding of the community they will help make decisions for.\nAt the end of the introductions, Simmons also gave the student representatives a piece of advice.\n\"Feel free to make the most of it and be part of it and help provide your voice when we're at board meetings and feedback and those things as well,\" Simmons said.\nThe student representatives will begin their responsibilities in September. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "DCPS approves fiscal year 2025 budget in 3 to 1 vote\n\n June 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1386\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Although the Dorchester County Board of Education approved the district's fiscal year 2025 budget on June 3, not everyone felt what was proposed was ready for approval.On social media, county residents shared their concerns, and board member Chris Wheedleton, who could not be at the meeting due to a work conflict, said he was shocked when he found out the budget had been approved.\n\"I as a board member then should have had the opportunity to receive feedback from the community (and) talk with the community about some of the ideas that we should have around that budget so that, by the time we voted, I was equipped to have all that feedback,\" he said.\nOne aspect of the balanced $88.5 million operating budget that drew particular concern — and has since been reversed — was the decision to remove media specialists from libraries, redistributing them to other positions in the school system and putting instructional assistants in the libraries.\nThis would have contributed to the district saving over $313,000, or 32.3%, in salaries and wages expenditures compared to fiscal year 2024, according to board documents.\nBoard member Talibah Chikwendu, who voted against approving the budget, said during the meeting that she thought the board needed to look harder at the budget to find other ways to save that money.\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat Thursday, Chikwendu said she did not like some of the ways that the district's financial concerns were being resolved.\n\"I like the fact that we got a chance to work to resolve them,\" she said, later adding, \"It wasn't about media specialists as much as it was about any frontline staff.\"\nChikwendu said if another category of staff had been moved around like that, \"the objection would have been the same.\"\nAt the meeting, North Dorchester High School librarian Jacqueline Bennett talked about the impact of her role in the school and asked that the district not remove media specialists from libraries.\n\"I understand that you have to make tough decisions, but I've devoted my life to this,\" she said.\nBoard member Sheri Hubbard, who voted in favor of the budget, said she agreed that \"it would be a shame\" to move media specialists to other positions in the district, and clarified that approval of the budget did not mean they couldn't amend it.\nIn an interview Friday, Board President Mike Diaz, who also voted to approve the budget, said Dorchester County Public Schools Interim Superintendent Jymil Thompson made a decision later in the week to not redistribute its media specialists to other positions in the school system.\nOn Wednesday morning, DCPS communications and community outreach specialist Valerie Goff said in an email that the district is \"looking at other means to mitigate the budget shortfalls.\" Goff said Thompson met with district media specialists June 6 to reassure them that their positions are secure.\nLeading up to the district announcing Thompson's decision, multiple took to social media expressing frustrations. Some called on residents to reach out to the Board of Education.\nLucas Thorpe, who ran for Diaz's board seat in the May primaries and lost, took to social media to express his discontent.\nThorpe said in an interview that he doesn't think taking librarians out of the libraries would benefit literacy scores. He said the entire situation points to a larger issue of elected officials trying to run the school system like a business, without considering students and staff.\nThorpe brought up the district's alternative education contract with Vision Quest, which the district is paying more than $93,000 per month for, as well as two alternative education programs with Transforming Lives for elementary and middle schools that the board approved at the June 3 meeting. He said that although alternative education is important, the public needs to draw concern to these contracts.\nDiaz said in an interview that alternative education is something DCPS has used for many years. He said the Board felt Vision Quest was \"best poised\" to provide services to the district, and mentioned there are services built into the program like family functional therapy.\nUNANSWERED QUESTIONS\nAlthough Wheedleton was aware the budget had been included on the agenda for the meeting, he said he communicated with the Finance Committee — made up of Diaz, board Vice President Susan Morgan, Thompson and DCPS Assistant Comptroller Laurie Dale — ahead of the meeting to say he didn't think the board was ready to approve the budget.\nWheedleton told them he still needed answers to some \"significant questions\" related to the budget approval process so that he could support the budget moving forward.\n\"I asked, both verbally and in writing, when we would be having a community meeting to share both the challenges and the priorities that we were working through, when we would have a meeting where we were expected to vote and what needed to be submitted to either the state or the county,\" Wheedleton said in an interview with the Star Democrat on Friday. \"And I still have yet to receive answers to those questions.\"\nIn the interview, Wheedleton spoke about the importance of receiving community feedback in the budget process. He said that, instead, the board made a decision at a meeting they knew he wouldn't be able to attend and gave no time for community feedback on Thompson's budget presentation.\nWheedleton said that although he is expressing his concerns publicly, he remains committed to working with the board to find \"productive solutions.\"\n\"I really do want us to learn from this and move forward in a way that we can all work together to make the best possible decisions for the schools and our students,\" he said.\nAt the meeting, Diaz said unlike previous years where it would take about two months of work to get the budget to the finish line, the fiscal year 2025 budget process started in January.\n\"I can't tell you how many meetings we did and the hours that we committed to really getting into this thing to make it what it is right now,\" Diaz said at the meeting. \"Nobody's ever going to be perfect, and I think there's probably still some more work to do ongoing as we move through this thing.\"\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat Friday, Diaz said there are some things the board will agree on and others that it won't. He said it's inevitable that there are times when board members can't attend a meeting.\n'FISCAL CLIFF'\nThe balanced $88.5 million operating budget is a $7.4 million increase from fiscal year 2024.\nState revenue sources total $59.9 million, an increase of $4.6 million from fiscal year 2024. County revenue sources total $23.7 million, a decrease of $265,200 from fiscal year 2024. The remaining revenue comes from fund balance carryover from prior years and other funding sources, like investment income and building use income.\nCompared to the fiscal year 2024 budget, fixed charges expenditures increased 22%, from $17.8 million. Pupil services had the second largest increase between fiscal year 2024 and 2025 budgets, increasing 7.8%, from $2.7 million to $6.8 million.\nIn his budget presentation at the June 3 meeting, Thompson talked about the \"fiscal cliff\" that is coming with COVID-19-related Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funding and Maryland Leads grant funding coming to an end.\nDiaz said the district is trying to dial it back when it comes to spending. In January, the board asked for an audit trail so it could look at every financial transaction the district makes.\n\"We had an overspending problem,\" Diaz said. \"And to get the house back in order, we've got to do certain things to right that ship. And it's painful sometimes. And they're hard decisions to make.\"\nBoard members also talked about costs that are out of the district's control. Diaz mentioned inflation and Morgan, who voted to approve the budget, brought up a requirement of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future that the district will need to increase teacher starting salaries to $60,000 by 2026.\n\"That's not an easy thing to do,\" she said. \"And that's causing a lot of money to be poured into personnel.\"\nThompson warned that it's possible more cuts will need to be made down the road.\n\"We really have to look at our financial situation,\" he said, later adding, \"Our financial situation hasn't improved, and we've made a lot of poor decisions that have gotten us into this situation that we're in currently.\"\nThis story has been updated to include the district's response. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot school board passes special education staffing plan\n\n June 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 697\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot County Board of Education unanimously approved a special education staffing plan at its meeting Wednesday, but not without pinpointing areas to improve moving forward.Kristin Mentges, director of special education, showed projections that indicate the number of elementary special education students will decrease at all five schools this fall, though that may change as younger students' needs are identified early next school year.\nWhile Easton High School had a projected decrease in special education students, Easton Middle projects to increase from 71 to 85 and St. Michaels Middle High is expected to go from 38 to 51 students.\nMentges recommended that elementary and secondary staffing remain the same heading into next year, as well as the seven current speech therapists.\n\"We do feel like the number of teachers can currently support this number of students,\" Mentges said of the recommendation for secondary staffing. \"The caseloads are going to be a little bit higher, but not a whole lot.\"\nBoard members questioned if it would be more effective to analyze staffing needs for the elementary schools based on hours of need rather than number of students.\n\"116 students can be kind of elusive because it really is dependent upon the number of hours those students have,\" board Vice President Candace Henry said, referencing the upcoming projection for Easton Elementary. \"In configuring how many teachers are proposed, is it based on how many students that you have or how many hours the students are needing?\"\n\"It's both,\" Mentges replied. \"So we look at the hours, we look at the environments that the students are served in, as well as the numbers of students total.\"\nHenry asked that the presentation include those hours in the future, as did board President Emily Jackson.\n\"We have asked for hours every year, and we have not yet been able to discuss hours per student,\" Jackson said. \"We talk a lot, especially from a budget perspective, about our growing needs in special education. And to me it seems like our special ed staff has been pretty flat.\n\"It doesn't seem like we are really as a county growing with the student need proportionally.\"\nAdditional recommendations presented by Mentges included the addition of a special education supervisor and four additional instructional assistants \"to support young students with more significant disabilities.\"\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the next step would be setting up a work session next month to lay out special education data and indicate areas to improve upon. Henry requested that in the future, a work session be scheduled prior to the approval of the staffing plan, to which the board and Pepukayi agreed.\n\"I would like to continue this conversation,\" Jackson said. \"A yes vote from me tonight does not mean a 'check this box, let's talk about it next year.' If we could continue this conversation at a more frequent pace, that would be fantastic.\"\nENROLLMENT STEADY\nKevin Shafer, Talbot County Public Schools' director of operations, presented enrollment projects reviewed by the Maryland Department of Planning. Numbers are steady and no schools were marked to be overutilized.\n\"TCPS remains in a relatively comfortable position related to our overall utilization across all facilities,\" Shafer said. He signaled housing development, demographic shifts and the state's education plan — Blueprint for Maryland's Future — as potential as areas of uncertainty in regards to enrollment and facility needs.\nEaston High peaked around 93% facility utilization last year, according to how large of an enrollment it could support, but Shafer said that percent will drop in years to come. All other percents came in under 90%, with Tilghman Elementary at a district-low 57% last year.\nShafer was asked by the board which school may be next in line for renovations after Chapel District Elementary School's upcoming expansion. He said Easton High School would be next, even if it's not needed the most.\n\"We would look at the state facility assessment data and use the data in order to make an informed decision on what makes more sense,\" Shafer said. \"The truth of the matter is that Easton Middle School is probably in a greater need for a renovation, but unfortunately state funding is dependent on the age of the building. … We have some years yet before we would qualify for funding.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester BOE votes to terminate alternative education contract\n\n June 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 570\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Following a tense discussion, the Dorchester County Board of Education voted to terminate its three-year contract with Vision Quest, an alternative education program for district high schoolers that has been met with criticism from residents since it was approved in September.Board member Chris Wheedleton, who voted against approving the contract in September, made the motion at a board meeting Thursday to terminate the contract for convenience. Along with Wheedleton, board members Talibah Chikwendu and Sheri Hubbard voted in favor of terminating the contract. Board Vice President Susan Morgan voted against termination, and board President Mike Diaz abstained from the vote and stayed silent during the discussion, as his wife is employed at Vision Quest.\nAccording to the contract, either party can terminate the agreement by providing written notice at least 180 days before the termination date. Under the agreement, Dorchester County Public Schools paid Vision Quest $93,363 per month for:\nIn-school services — such as pyscho-educational groups, anger management and conflict resolution — for up to 10 students at any given time.Voluntary off-campus educational and behavioral support services at Vision Quest's Morningstar Youth Academy facility in Woolford for up to 16 students at any given time.Family functional therapy services for up to 10 DCPS families at any given time.\nOver three years, this would have cost the district over $3.3 million.\nBefore the vote, Wheedleton said he had multiple conversations with constituents about Vision Quest. He said the contract should be terminated because it is \"fiscally irresponsible\" and he believes Vision Quest has violated its contract with DCPS by not providing monthly reports.\n\"I, as a board member, have only seen two reports this year on progress,\" he said, adding that he doesn't think those reports have actually demonstrated progress.\nWheedleton said he believes there needs to be alternative education options for students, but this current agreement is not in the district's best interest.\nMorgan — who said she had been to Morningstar Youth Academy in Woolford and talked with parents of the students in the program — asked Wheedleton if he had visited the facility. He said he had not because that is not his job as a board member.\nMorgan said there were seven district students who graduated this year that wouldn't have if they had \"stayed on the path they were on.\"\n\"You have no idea what would have happened to those students if they had been in our schools supported by another program,\" Wheedleton said in response.\nMorgan said DCPS has tried other alternative education programs that have been unsuccessful. She said the school system won't have enough time to put another program in place before school starts in the fall.\nWheedleton said he believes the district's executive team has time to form a new agreement for an alternative education program.\n\"It's a three-year contract,\" Morgan said. \"And if you want to break the contract and you think you have the reasons, then you've made the vote.\"\nChikwendu said she didn't believe the Vision Quest contract is in the best interest of DCPS students. She said she has based that on information from people who have gone to the facility, from people who have seen the program inside schools and from the Vision Quest reports that the schools have received.\nHubbard said she voted to terminate the contract due to the \"numerous, numerous complaints\" she has received about Vision Quest as well as a conversation she had with a former Vision Quest staff member about the conditions. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "This Juneteenth, let's prioritize education policy",
    "date": "2024-06-16",

    "content": "This Juneteenth, let's prioritize education policy\n\n June 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TROY ROLLING | Section: Columns \n \n 703\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On June 19, the United States will commemorate Juneteenth, or National Independence Day — the federal holiday celebrated annually to commemorate the ending of slavery. Scholars have described Juneteenth as a celebration of the legacy of Frederick Douglass, the famed Maryland abolitionist, orator and writer who influenced tens of thousands of people about the evils of slavery and urged the nation to abide by its espoused principles.Time and time again, Douglass demonstrated education's importance in breaking the cycles of poverty and oppression.\nBorn into slavery on the Eastern Shore, he secretly learned to read and write, realizing that knowledge was vital to freedom. His journey from bondage to intellectual empowerment confirmed his lifelong assertion that education is the essential ingredient to liberation and equality.\nThrough his speeches, writings and political actions, Douglass emphasized that ignorance was a tool of oppression, and that education was crucial for social and economic advancement. His mentorship and influence inspired future generations to use education to combat racial injustice and achieve greater equality, demonstrating how education is vital in the fight for civil rights and equality for all.\nOur organization has worked tirelessly to ensure these principles permeate every aspect of our society. Unfortunately, however, two centuries later, some of Maryland's elected representatives appear to be forgetting the lessons that Douglass taught us on the importance of taking accountability for education to give our citizens the opportunity to succeed.\nUpon review of these statistics, we should all be alarmed and demand that those currently and seeking to represent us provide their educational plans. Prince George's County served as a salient example. Although one of the wealthiest majority African American counties in the United States, with a median household income of nearly $100,000, the county is dead last in statewide education rankings. The graduation rate is less than 75%, the second-worst ranking in the state, behind only Baltimore City, where 23 schools have existing challenges.\nInstead of improving, too many of the children are being left behind. Last year, the county's high schools underperformed every single state education target and four of the schools lost a star in the state's ranking system. Given these starting statistics, it is little wonder why, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, income inequality and other social injustices continue to increase in the county year-over-year.\nIt will take committed elected leadership to make the changes required to make a difference. Yet, when asked about the school system's challenges, County Executive Angela Alsobrooks responded, \"Not my responsibility.\"\nThis answer is especially worrisome because Ms. Alsobrooks is now a nominee for the U.S. Senate. As a senator, she would have the power to break the cycles of educational bankruptcy by pushing for these policies on the federal level, but her comments should make all of us pause. Worse yet, Ms. Alsobrooks recently announced that she opposes charter schools and school choice, which rescue marginalized students from failing schools.\nPatrick Wolf, a professor in educational policy, found that \"the 19 most rigorous scientific studies of private school-choice programs find that they tend to have positive effects on student achievement, especially several years after students have entered a private school of their parents' choosing,\" increasing their chances of graduating from high school, attending college and receiving a college degree.\nAfrican Americans and underserved communities are the primary beneficiaries of these policies. Recent polling shows that 79% of Black parents support school choice and 74% support charter schools.\nAs Frederick Douglass once profoundly stated, \"It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.\" Indeed. Education creates a cycle of success for future generations, leading to a more informed, resilient, and prosperous society. By breaking the chains of ignorance and poverty, it builds the foundation for strong, thriving communities that can overcome challenges and achieve collective progress.\nOn this Juneteenth, let us pay tribute to his legacy by recognizing and acting upon Douglass' vital lesson. By re-prioritizing education policy in the Maryland political landscape, we will honor Douglass' memory and sacrifice while paving the way for a more just and equitable future, filled with hope and opportunity.\nTroy Rolling is chairman of the Frederick Douglass Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based national education nonprofit that does Christian work based on the life and legacy of Frederick Douglass. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Wearing hoods, having cellphones on are not allowed in Calvert schools\n\n June 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARTY MADDEN mmadden@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 480\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When Calvert County's next school year begins in August something will be missing from students' heads — hoods.In finalizing the revised code of conduct for Calvert County Public Schools, a majority of school board members voted to forbid students from wearing hoods in the school building.\nAfter making her motion to enact the hood prohibition, board member Lisa Grenis clarified that students could still wear hooded sweatshirts in school but the hoods must be off the heads.\nGrenis cited a recent 12-question survey submitted to educators that drew nearly 1,300 responses, with a strong majority favoring the ban.\nIn lobbying for a policy change, Grenis has stated that some students are wearing the hoods up to conceal earbuds, thus ignoring classroom instruction or evading recognition by teachers and administrators in the event of a disruptive situation.\nLarry Titus, the school system's school safety specialist, confirmed the difficulty in positively identifying a student whose image is captured on surveillance camera if a hood conceals his or her head.\n\"I've been told there's many reasons why kids want to wear hoods and it's not all nefarious,\" board member Dawn Balinski said. \"Sometimes it's because you're having a bad hair day.\"\nCecilia Lewis, director of student services, who was advised by a large committee on the code of conduct rewrite, confirmed that there can be special instances where \"the preservation of a student's dignity\" is taken into consideration. Students must be proactive in seeking that preservation, Lewis indicated.\n\"We're not removing all things worn on the head,\" Grenis said. \"We're removing one thing.\"\nAttending her first meeting as the student member of the board, Grace Minakowski stated, \"I don't think that banning hoods addresses the underlying issues of students vaping and students getting into fights. It concerns me that we're not looking towards why are students getting into fights and why are students vaping. We're just going for the quick grab — 'let's ban hoods.'\"\nMinakowski was allowed to vote on Grenis' motion and cast the lone vote against the modification to the code of conduct change regarding hoods. Board president Antoine White and board vice president Inez Claggett opted to abstain.\nThe board then voted unanimously to approve the complete revised code of conduct.\nEarlier this spring, the board discussed changes to the policy regarding electronic and communication devices. Those changes were included in the newly adopted code of conduct.\nThe change stated, \"Students may bring cellular phones to school but are not permitted to bring other electronic or communication devices, such as personal laptops, because Calvert County Public Schools provides laptops to students in grades 3-12 and iPads for students in grades pre-k to 2.\"\nThe policy revision also addresses cellphone procedures.\n\"Students may bring their phone, but once school begins, the device must be powered off — not on vibrate or silent mode — and must remain in a non-visible, secure location with noted exceptions in high school,\" according to the policy.\nTwitter: @MartySoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline Commissioners approve CCPS FY25 budget summary\n\n June 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 626\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Although Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons told county commissioners Tuesday morning that increases in the cost of business are driving the district's fiscal year 2025 operating budget, he said the district feels that it is in a \"good spot\" when it comes to the budget.\"We feel like we're in a good spot, budget-wise, to move forward,\" he said about the $94.48 million balanced operating budget at a commissioners meeting on Tuesday.\nAt the meeting, the commissioners unanimously voted to approve the proposed CCPS budget summary, which the Caroline County Board of Education had approved at its work session last week.\nThe budget is an increase of nearly $4 million from the fiscal year 2024 budget. Simmons pointed to a $185,000 increase in miscellaneous revenue, interest revenue and non-resident tuition.\n\"We had a good year with interest revenue,\" he said.\nRevenue from the county totals $18.49 million, an increase of $2.4 million over the previous year, and revenue from the state totals $75 million, an increase of $1.38 million over the previous year.\nSimmons talked about rising expenditures, such as budget adjustments for Blueprint for Maryland's Future programs, a 5% increase in health insurance costs and increases due to the cost of doing business. Those cost of business increases include Maryland Association of Boards of Education insurance costs and transportation costs.\nWhen it comes to Blueprint programming, unrestricted career ladders and unrestricted transitional supplemental instruction — which had both previously been restricted — will cost the district $559,688.\nSimmons said teacher pension costs continue to increase a little every year.\nSimmons also talked about the need to fund positions that were previously funded through COVID-19-related Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funding and Maryland Leads grants, which will both expire in September. Those positions include a third assistant principal at North Caroline High School and three technology support positions so the district can continue to have those employees in each building.\n\"We've learned that having tech support in person available at every campus was a much better model than having a centralized model and literally sending people out to the buildings,\" Simmons said. \"The mileage was killing us.\"\nSimmons said the district was able to save money from salary lapse, which is when new employees that are hired to fill the positions of people retiring. Because the new hires often have less experience than their predecessors, their salaries aren't as high.\n\"So you get some savings there,\" Simmons said.\nAfter Simmons' presentation, commissioners asked questions related to the Blueprint, a state plan to improve student outcomes and the quality of education through increasing education funding by $3.8 billion over a 10 year period.\nCommission Vice President Larry Porter asked Simmons how close the district is to reaching a $60,000 starting salary for teachers, which districts must do by 2026, per the Blueprint.\nSimmons said starting teacher salaries for next year are over $55,000, and he believes the district will reach the $60,000 mandate by 2026.\nThere are two scales for teachers: the traditional scale and the career ladder. The career ladder is a part of one of the five pillars of the Blueprint.\nTeachers on the career ladder are encouraged to pursue National Board Certification, which is a process that teaches teachers to reflect on their craft. An expenditure of $70,000 in the fiscal year 2025 operating budget will go toward increasing salaries for teachers who receive that certification.\nSimmons said the district will reach the $60,000 salary minimum by 2026 for teachers who are on the career ladder, but not for teachers on the traditional scale. He said current teachers have the option to stay on the traditional scale or move onto the career ladder.\n\"But all new hired staff will start on the career ladder,\" he said. \"So that will be the scale that we get to ($60,000).\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This includes prepayments and covering for anticipated overages.\nJones asked for approval to transfer $75,000 to student services, in part for prepayments on software, and $500,000 to transportation to prepay upcoming bus lease payments.\nThe district also asked to transfer $600,000 to fixed charges for other postemployment benefits contributions and health insurance prepayments.\n\"We're just trying to make headway there because we're very far behind on that liability,\" Jones said of the benefits payments.\nTo balance the budget, Jones requested that savings from three categories — instructional salaries, special education and interfund transfer to capital projects — be used to transfer the funds. Notably, there was $850,000 saved in instructional salaries.\n\"Whenever we're transferring out of instructional salaries, it always raises an eyebrow,\" Council Vice President Pete Lesher said. \"Because of course that savings comes from vacant positions.\"\n\" … I'm curious what the plan is to fill those positions for the coming years so that we don't see that loss in direct student contact,\" Lesher said.\nJones said the district has a director of recruitment and retention. She also mentioned that having mentors for teachers has been \"very helpful for retention of newly-hired staff.\"\n\"I think a little bit of the savings are a reflection of us having grant availability this year,\" Jones added. \" … If money frees up in a grant and it's appropriate to charge a teacher or part of a teacher salary, we're going to use that money.\"\n\"It's comforting to know that you're being intentional about ensuring that those positions will get filled,\" Lesher said. \" … The success of the schools is one of our most powerful economic development tools. When the schools succeed, it helps all the other businesses, everybody else who's looking to hire in this community.\"\nThe council approved the request unanimously. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Diaz resigns from Dorchester Board of Education\n\n July 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 648\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Mike Diaz, president of the Board of Education of Dorchester County, has resigned his position, leaving three members on the five-member board.According to a Monday morning press release from Dorchester County Public Schools, Diaz cited health and family concerns as the reason behind his resignation, which was effective June 28.\nIn an interview Monday, Diaz said this was something he's been thinking about since undergoing a liver transplant in February.\n\"During that time I was recovering and thinking about leaving the board,\" he said. \"But I also wanted to see through the new superintendent process and knew that would take a few months.\"\nDiaz said he almost died after getting an infection in May.\n\"Fortunately my wife found me passed out on the floor,\" he said. \"The Dorchester County paramedics did a fantastic job, and I received great medical care. And I'm still here.\"\nDiaz said he wanted to make sure he left the board and the management of the board \"in good hands and on good footing\" before resigning, and he felt that had been accomplished when he resigned Friday.\nDiaz' resignation comes on the heels of Board Vice President Susan Morgan's resignation in mid-June.\nMorgan announced her resignation one day after a board meeting that broadcast fractures in board member relationships. At the meeting, Board Member Chris Wheedleton called out board leadership and said the culture of the board felt \"divisive\" rather than collaborative.\nDiaz said his health was the only reason for his resignation.\n\"Every board or council or what have you has its moments,\" he said. \"People trying to work together and find a common path. And (my resignation) has nothing to do with anything other than when I fell ill in February.\"\nWith neither a president nor vice president, the board is planning to have a special meeting next week where an election for a president and vice president will be held, said DCPS communications and community outreach specialist Valerie Goff.\nAlthough the board is currently down two members, the remaining three members make up the minimum number of members needed to hold a meeting, or a quorum.\nThe Dorchester County Council is in charge of making appointments to vacant Board of Education seats. Monday morning, Goff said the county had been made aware of Diaz's resignation. She said the district is waiting to hear how soon the county is planning to move and what it is planning to do.\nGoff said she does not know how far along the council is in appointing Morgan's seat.\n\"The important thing for Dorchester County Public Schools is focusing on the upcoming school year,\" Goff said. \"These resignations will be dealt with by the County Council, and we'll await and hear from them. But we're busy here getting ready to push out the next school year.\"\nNOVEMBER ELECTION\nBefore submitting their resignations, both Diaz and Morgan were running for reelection in District 1 and District 3, respectively.\nDorchester County Board of Elections Program Manager Kim Jones said Morgan has already withdrawn from the election and her name will not appear on the ballot for the general election in November.\nDiaz, who received the second highest number of votes in his district in the May primary, has not decided if he will withdraw from the election. He said he doesn't know what the future holds and it is something he will have to discuss with his family.\nIf Diaz chooses to withdraw from the election, his name will also be removed from the ballot as long as he withdraws before the ballots are proofed in August, Jones said.\nDiaz said he wishes nothing but the best to the board and recently appointed Superintendent Jymil Thompson.\n\"As with anything, I hope that (the board) stays aligned with the common goals that we have set forth,\" he said. \"And that's retaining teachers and providing good alternative education programs and school safety. ... Those are things that are going to make good school systems.\"\nThis report may be updated. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Finding childcare in Maryland is hard. Finding good childcare is even harder\n\n July 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KHUSHBOO RATHORE Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 2331\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When Stephanie Jovine searched for child care for her nearly 4-year-old daughter LuzMarie in Prince George's County in 2015, she found two options, both of them bad.Jovine couldn't afford the first one, and the second denied the young girl snacks and then sheets for sleeping.\n\"I was so upset, you know, it was so hard to trust anyone,\" said Jovine, a teacher in the District of Columbia Public Schools at the time.\nAfter six months of searching, Jovine found a grandmother who ran a small before-and-after care service, LiLi's Child Care Center, in Temple Hills. The times the program was open aligned perfectly with Jovine's needs.\n\"She's a godsend, for real,\" said Jovine, who's now 33.\nJovine's arduous search for child care is not unique — and it would not even be her last search. Interviews with several Maryland families showed that while finding child care is hard, finding a facility that fits a family's needs and budget is even harder.\nMaryland offers a rating system to help parents select the right child care facility, but providers say the rating system is difficult to navigate. Most parents interviewed by the Local News Network said they never looked at the state rating system.\nSimilarly, the state offers a generous scholarship program to help pay for child care, but providers complain they often have to wait months for the state to pay for child care for those scholarship recipients. Parents like Jovine struggle with the scholarship program, too.\nThe complications of finding child care in Maryland often leave families waiting for a place for their child, and that can lead to trouble, said Doug Lent, communications director for Maryland Family Network, which helps parents find child care and helps providers manage their businesses.\n\"When you're on that waiting list, that's when you're more likely to be tempted to rely on unlicensed care, unregulated care, and get into a situation that's maybe not safe or maybe not high quality,\" Lent said.\nThe ratings dilemma\nLinda Garey woke up at 6 a.m. on a springtime Saturday at her home in Dundalk to create a communication board for the autistic children she cares for daily in her home. Eleven hours later, she was still working on the project. She isn't paid for the time she spends preparing her classroom.\nGarey is a level-3 provider with Maryland EXCELS, the child care quality rating system in the state that offers a top rating of 5. Garey created a 65-page handbook outlining her teaching philosophy. She also assists other programs with their handbooks.\n\"I've typed probably about 20 to 30 handbooks and turned them in for other people, right? And they're all level 5,\" she said.\nEXCELS is an optional program for licensed child care providers. It offers them training and guidance and, if they qualify for it, a rating that parents can refer to when choosing a place to care for their child.\nThe Maryland EXCELS rating is based on five categories: licensing, staff qualifications, accreditation, developmentally appropriate practices and administrative policies. The highest overall rating a facility can get is the lowest rating it gets in any of those five categories.\nAnd even though Garey has more than 20 years of experience, her lack of national accreditation as a child care provider means she can't go higher than level 3.\nGarey is working on getting her child development associate credential and becoming accredited — but she won't be submitting that information to Maryland EXCELS. She said whenever she submits new documents and information to the Maryland State Department of Education, it goes to waste.\n\"'I turned in some information about 20 times and it was denied,\" she said.\nState officials insist they are trying to help. Jena Smith, the director of quality improvement initiatives at the state's Division of Early Childhood, said quality assurance specialists work with each child care facility to improve its quality rating.\nThe Maryland State Department of Education also publishes a provider toolkit that outlines the documents necessary to rise up the ratings ladder, Smith said. The requirements for each level build on the last, she said.\n\"It's a scaffold, and so that's really how our quality assurance specialists work with our programs,\" Smith said. \"They help them assess where they currently are and where they want to go.\"\nSince January 2020, the number of level-5 providers in Maryland has increased by 9.6%, according to state statistics retrieved by the Local News Network. However, 15 of the state's 24 jurisdictions have lost level-5 providers, and providers overall appear to have mixed feelings about the EXCELS program.\nAsked to rate the EXCELS program's effectiveness on a 1-to-5 scale, with 1 being least effective and 5 being most effective, the 256 child care providers who replied to a Local News Network survey gave the program an average rating of 3.\n\"I answered 3 because part of the program, I feel, has been extremely helpful, such as writing policies for guidance (on) nutrition and such,\" Cheryl Thomsen, a child care provider in Salisbury, wrote in her survey response. \"I did obtain accreditation but found it was very difficult to actually follow all the requirements properly on a daily basis.\"\nA difficult search\nJovine moved from Prince George's County to Waldorf, in Charles County, in 2020 and left teaching. Two years later, she returned to the District of Columbia Public Schools system while pregnant with her second child — only to discover searching for child care was still difficult and time-consuming.\n\"I was looking and looking and looking for child care,\" she said.\nJovine experienced exactly what other young mothers have experienced in recent years. She went on a frantic search for child care without referring to the state's EXCELS ratings.\nPriya Mahfooz's son Zakir was born in May 2019. She sent Zakir to a child care facility near the family home in Clarksburg, in Montgomery County, a few months later. But that operation shut down at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, never to reopen.\nDesperate for child care, Mahfooz and a friend banded together to hire the teacher who ran that closed facility to look after their children. Each family paid the teacher $425 a week.\nIn the summer of 2021, Mahfooz decided to send Zakir back to a child care facility. During her search, Mahfooz said, she didn't rely on Maryland EXCELS or the state inspection reports.\n\"When you're searching, it's really just whatever you're being fed in your feeds,\" Mahfooz said. \"You're thinking about price, location, (online) ratings.\"\nMahfooz found a child care slot for Zakir later that summer in Germantown and then enrolled him in Green Valley Montessori School in September 2021.\nMeanwhile, Javiera King, an administrator at the University of Maryland, had to hire a nanny to take care of her young daughter, Layla, while the family searched for a slot in a child care facility.\nWhile pregnant, \"I had to put myself on a waitlist already because most day cares have a waitlist a year out,\" she said.\nKing's nanny gave her two weeks notice in December 2023. That meant King had to quickly piece together a schedule where family members took turns caring for her daughter, who was 11 months old at the time. The family then found a child care facility that had a part-time slot for Layla, meaning the family's piecemeal plan for caring for the young girl would continue.\nFinally, in February, Layla's part-time slot at that facility became full-time.\n\"We were really lucky with how everything played out for us,\" King said.\nJovine wasn't so lucky. When she was five months pregnant with her second child, she called 12 child care facilities. All of them had a waiting list of a year or more for infants.\nHer daughter Lily was born at the end of February 2023, and Jovine finished the school year on maternity leave. She had to go back to work in August, but the earliest availability at most nearby child care facilities was in October.\n\"There was one spot that had an availability. I wasn't too satisfied with it,\" Jovine said.\nThere were few toys and learning tools. The outdoor play equipment was dirty and the facility had no curriculum for promoting development in infants, Jovine said.\nShe found another option on a billboard. Jovine called that facility and when she found they had a spot, she took it. She only took three days off work to care for Lily.\nThe facility Jovine sent Lily to after a 10-month search is enrolled in the EXCELS program but is not yet rated.\nAsked if she referred to the EXCELS system during her search, Jovine said she didn't even know about the state rating system at the time.\nJovine has seen her daughter develop significantly at the day care. Lily is happy to go and a little reluctant to leave in the evenings, Jovine said.\n\"This is how I know she's in good hands. She likes it there,\" she said.\nA scholarship program\nIn addition to offering ratings of the state's child care providers, Maryland expanded its child care scholarship program in 2022, making it easier to afford child care, said Heather Harding, coordinator at the Federalsburg Judy Center in Caroline County.\nBut providers said the scholarship program doesn't work as well in practice as it does in theory.\nThe eligibility requirements for the scholarship program allow middle class families to apply. Any family of two making less than $61,222 per year is eligible; for a family of four, the limit is $104,438.\nA new fast-track program, launched on July 1, 2023, aims to reduce the wait time for parents to receive approval for a scholarship. Three days after applying, eligible families can get 60 days of child care paid for while their long-term aid application is processed. Scholarship values each year can range from $9,000 to $25,000 per child.\nLent, of the Maryland Family Network, said the new fast-track has vastly improved the scholarship program. Previously, parents would be placed on a waiting list to receive help with their child care expenses, he said.\nBut other requirements can make the system a catch-22, Harding said. Parents are required to be enrolled in school or working to be eligible for the scholarship, she said. But many of them can't do either unless they have child care guaranteed.\n\"Even if they find it, then they can't pay for it till they get the scholarship,\" Harding said.\nThese scholarships can only be used in facilities that are enrolled in the EXCELS program. After parents receive a voucher from the state, they present it to the provider. The provider then has to send paperwork to the state in order to be paid.\nGarey, the child care provider from Dundalk, said this is one of the most frustrating parts about the process. Multiple times, she filed paperwork and had to wait three months to be paid. At one point, the state owed her $15,000 in scholarship pay. This happened after the state moved to an advance-payment system that was supposed to provide providers with income more quickly.\n\"It's this delay after delay after delay,\" Garey said.\nShe finds ways to deal with the months-late payments because she refuses to make the parents pay or to drop families from her list of clients.\n\"One little girl is nonverbal. She sang and pointed to every single letter of the alphabet,\" Garey said. \"I did that. So why in the world would I drop that family?\"\nOther providers also complain about late scholarship payments. Christine Morris, the director of Trinity Lutheran Christian School and Early Learning Center in Joppa, in Harford County, said this spring that the state owed her $40,000 in scholarship payments. And Shantel Rouzer, who runs Happy Feet Enrichment Childcare Center in Baltimore City, said she turned away students on the scholarship program because she knows the state's reimbursements will come so late.\n\"It's not the families' fault, but (Maryland State Department of Education officials) don't hear us!!!?? And providers are tired!!!\" Rouzer wrote in response to a survey from the Local News Network.\nSolving her own problem\nParents like Jovine don't always know about the scholarship program. When she found out about the program in February, months after Lily, her youngest daughter, started day care, Jovine applied. A day later, the program's new fast-track program started temporarily covering her child care costs for two months.\n\"It took a huge load, And it's amazing to have that option,\" she said.\nBefore that, Jovine was paying $1,360 per month for child care for Lily. On top of that, she had to provide snacks, milk, lunch and other resources to the center.\nBut four days before Jovine's temporary aid expired, she hadn't gotten a final decision from the state. Jovine didn't receive a response until June. By then, she was already paying out of pocket.\nShe'll have to continue to do so because the state decided she was earning too much money to qualify. Noting her application listed extra money from her old job at D.C. Public Schools that doesn't reflect what she's making now, she has reapplied.\nJovine and her longtime partner, Abdul Dopson, now need child care more than ever. Their third child, Mia, was born on June 14.\nKnowing infant spots are difficult to find, Jovine decided to leave her teaching job — and do her own small part to alleviate Maryland's child care shortage.\n\"I got licensed to start a day care myself: a home day care,\" she said. \"The need is that prevalent, you know, I might as well try to open up a day care myself and see what happens.\"\nJovine's fledgling child care facility, Elite Kidz Clubhouse, opens in August — but it's already overtaken her home's living room and dining room. She's spent more than $2,500 on cots, desks, developmentally appropriate toys and other necessities.\nA large, colorful tree painted on the wall of the facility showcases the skills Jovine wants her students to get out of their day-to-day activities. Jovine said she wants her facility to work its way through the EXCELS system and eventually qualify as a preschool under the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education reform plan.\n\"Why not start this beautiful generation how it should, educating them and giving them what they need to be successful little children?\" she said.\nLocal News Network reporter Laura Shaughnessy contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Milk cartons are now 55 cents each.\nMeal prices do not impact the number of students who would be eligible for free or reduced meals, Hickey said.\nIn other business it was noted, as it moves toward self operational food services, QACPS once again approved a piggybacking contract, this one a little more soft served.\nThe BOE approved a piggyback off Anne Arundel County Public Schools contract with Hershey Creamery Company for ice cream products and freezers.\nThis contract that other Maryland school districts are piggybacking off of is set to expire March 2025 and then QACPS will be able to piggyback off of Baltimore County Public Schools' bid through March 2028, Hickey said.\nThe fiscal impact will be $50,000 and funding will be out of the food service fund balance account, she said.\nQACPS currently sells Hershey's ice cream as an a la carte item.\nThe QACPS Board of Education will next meet July 17 at 6 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Stafford's long-time friend and former classmate Phil Feldman stopped by the learning center on July 2 to take a tour and hand current Executive Director Goldie Cooper a check for $25,000.\nFeldman, who made the donation in Stafford's honor, said he made the donation because he wants the center to be named after Stafford, who was New Beginnings' executive director for eight years.\nNow there are plans to rename the center \"Dr. Theresa Stafford's New Beginnings Learning Academy.\" Later this summer, the facility plans to hold a dedication event.\nFeldman said he hopes his donation benefits the kids that New Beginnings serves. He talked about the experiences that the nonprofit learning center provides children.\n\"It takes kids who are maybe not as fortunate as most and shows them parts of the world they (might have) never seen,\" he said.\nDuring his visit to New Beginnings on July 2, Feldman, along with his wife Marlene Feldman and grandchildren Andie and Claire, heard from staff and students of the learning center about the book they have been reading as a class. Students also told Feldman about some of the field trips they have gone on and activities they have tried out.\nRecently, the Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay donated golf clubs to New Beginnings so that children can practice their swings.\nMyche Smith, who started as a volunteer at New Beginnings and has now been employed there for two years, said the center rolled out its new STEM program this week. Throughout the day, different age groups can try out different activities in the new STEM Center within New Beginnings.\n\"The kids are going to enjoy it because STEM is all about having fun,\" Lee said. \"It's learning through fun.\"\nFeldman said he loved seeing the children work on their reading and writing skills during his visit.\n\"That'll take them as far as they want to go,\" he said.\nAlong with Feldman's donation, New Beginnings recently received $40,000 in grant awards, including a $10,000 grant from the John and Janice Wyatt Foundation to go toward a reading programming.\n\"Reading can be fun, it can be exciting,\" Lee said. \"It can open up a new world for you that you can't even imagine.\"\nLee does the bookkeeping and grant writing for New Beginnings. She said she has written $180,000 in grants, and the center has gotten about $72,000 in grant awards so far.\n\"And I'm still writing because I vowed to do $120,000 in grants,\" she said.\nLooking back on what her sister did for New Beginnings, Lee talked about how Stafford grew the learning center that now serves pre-K through seventh graders.\n\"She went from a $43,000 budget ... to over $185,000 a year to give these kids the best experiences she could give them,\" Lee said.\nLee said Stafford wanted kids \"to have the best education they could have in the best environment.\" She said kids don't always have the best home situations.\n\"But we can put them in the best learning situations they could be in,\" Lee said. \"So (Stafford) made sure that this place was outfitted to look like any other center in the world.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In 1974, Loveless got a master's in education from the same school.\nIn between earning his two degrees, Loveless was the athletic director at Colonel Richardson High School.\nHe later became the vice principal at Lockerman Middle School, and he finished his academic career at CRHS as principal.\n\"He was famous as a football coach, for no matter how cold it got, Joe never wore anything but a short-sleeved white shirt. He didn't want to show anybody that the cold bothered him,\" said Caroline County Commissioner Larry Porter.\nLoveless got into politics in the early 1980s, starting as Town Commissioner of Denton, and in 1982 becoming the town's mayor.\nHe organized celebrity golf events at the Caroline Country Club, which brought members of the Orioles and The Baltimore Colts.\n\"Joe was instrumental, years ago, he would put together a celebrity golf tournament where he would have Johnny Unitas, and a group of people would come over and play golf. He had access to them because his cousin was a newscaster,\" Porter said. \"... He would select an organization to benefit. One year it was reading programs.\"\n\"... It was a two-day event, and they would raise quite a good amount of money. Joe pulled all that together. Joe had an ability to do those things. Joe was a great guy,\" Porter said.\nPorter said at Loveless also sold real estate and cars. He founded Joe Loveless Tires.\nHe was an active member of Saint Luke's Methodist Church in Denton.\n\"When he got involved with an activity, he worked hard. He gave it everything that he had no question about that. He benefited a lot of organizations here during his time,\" Porter said.\nJohn Nussear, who went to college with Loveless, said Loveless was never short of creative ideas.\n\"Joe had an entrepreneurial spirit about him. He had a million ideas. He was never without an idea that he wanted to share and get other people interested in,\" Nussear said. \"The truth about Joe was that he was salesman — a very good salesman of ideas.\"\nNussear thinks Loveless' main legacy is his energy.\n\"Energy, and ideas and a willingness to to what it takes to put an idea into action. He was very generous to a fault. He would give his last penny to someone else if he thought that they needed it,\" Nussear said.\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, plans for a private celebration of life gathering to be held in September are incomplete. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Stronger defense, improved education\n\n July 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 374\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Among American's top concerns going into the November election are inflation (the economy), illegal migration across our southern border and crime. These are all substantive worries; however, none of them seems likely to remain equally prominent forever. This is because they have been sufficiently elevated in public consciousness that politicians are being forced to pay more attention to them.There is reason to believe, in fact, that some corrective actions, if not all resolute, are already being taken. Less obvious on the public's radar warning screen, but longer term in nature, are questions regarding national defense and youth education. These, in my opinion, should be higher on our worry list than they are today.\nAs a result of relative public indifference neither of these issues seems to be getting serious attention from elected leaders.\nFor example, the latest proposed national defense budget mandates we will be spending less going forward in real terms on military readiness than several years ago. In addition, defense spending is or soon will be exceeded by interest payments on federal debt. This does not bode well for longer-term security at a time when our chief adversaries, including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, are all looking to make the world more dangerous and less safe.\nDiplomacy and appeasement have proven unreliable compared to military superiority when it comes to keeping the peace. More political pressure has to be applied to both parties to take a path to enhanced military readiness.\nRegarding youth education, there has been a steady increase in public funding for education over the years. At the same time, multiple test results for middle grade and high school students do not show an improving academic return on these outlays. This is troubling for many reasons including a more competitive global work environment, a growing need for domestic innovation and an historical correlation between income potential and educational achievement.\nAlso, and it should go without saying, sound government requires a thoughtful electorate. There are clearly many pressing concerns on the minds of Americans today, and they all deserve attention. The point here is that our preeminent standing in the world will be in jeopardy if we don't start paying more than lip service to a stronger national defense and improving educational outcomes.\nART CECIL\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

On July 18, Brandy Dawson Cumberland and Christine LaMonica — who were appointed by the Dorchester County Council to fill Diaz and Morgan's seats — will be sworn in as the District 1 and District 3 board members, respectively.\nAt the meeting on Thursday, Hubbard said the board welcomes Cumberland and LaMonica and looks forward to working together \"to help make Dorchester County Public Schools a place where students are safe and get the best education possible, a place where teachers look forward to coming to work and want to serve their entire careers here, and a place where parents are happy to send their children to us, knowing we will do our all for them.\"\nALTERNATIVE EDUCATION\nAfter electing its new leadership, the board unanimously approved a one-year contract with Transforming Lives for an alternative education program for elementary and middle school students.\nThe program — which will be housed at The Judy Center at Sandy Hill Elementary School and at the New Directions Learning Academy — will cost the district $950,000, or about $79,000 each month for 12 months. The program will serve a maximum of 48 students at one time.\nAt the meeting, DCPS Superintendent Jymil Thompson said the district looks at this program as one stop in a student's education journey. He said it is a place where students can remedy behavior and improve academics before going back into a \"regular educational setting.\"\nThompson also said the district is looking for a new term to replace \"alternative education.\"\n\"We're going to change the term to something more positive in nature,\" he said.\nAlternative education has been a hot topic in Dorchester County this past school year.\nIn June, the Board of Education voted to terminate its more than three-year contract with Vision Quest, an alternative education program for district high schoolers that has been met with criticism from residents since the contract was approved in September. The district had been paying Vision Quest $93,363 per month for services, which would have added up to over $3.3 million over three years.\nOne day after the vote — and a tense discussion leading up to the vote — Morgan resigned from the board. Morgan was the only board member to vote against terminating the Vision Quest contract.\nAt the meeting on Thursday, Hubbard said the Vision Quest program will be available to district high school students for the first half of the 2024-2025 school year.\n\"And then we will make a determination somewhere in that timeframe (of) how to proceed,\" she said.\nOne thing Hubbard likes about the Transforming Lives program for elementary and middle schools is that the professionals from Transforming Lives will train teachers, she said.\n\"So that eventually we will be able to do this on our own without having to look to a third party,\" she said. \"So I think that's a very positive step forward.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

College representatives spoke to the council Tuesday, saying that the project will help the college support a slew of trade programs.\nDavid Harper, vice president for workforce and academic programs, said he hopes the project \"inspires not just students, but parents and local community members\" to understand the importance of living and working locally after receiving a trade education.\nThe project's estimated cost is about $56 million, with around $42 million of that expected from state funding and the rest expected from five counties served by Chesapeake College — Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne's and Kent. Talbot County's share of the remaining funding is 21.8%, second to only Queen Anne's County at 28.9%.\nThis cost, just over $3 million, will be split between fiscal years 2026, 2027 and 2028.\nKaren Smith, vice president of administrative services at Chesapeake College, noted the original project had Talbot's estimated share at more than $4 million. However, the project's scope was reduced as the college's marine technology program will not be included.\nThe facility will support agricultural, electrical, welding, HVAC, advanced manufacturing, carpentry and masonry programs.\nEarlier Tuesday, Chesapeake College presented to the Caroline County Commissioners. The commission, however, elected to take time to discuss the request with the county's finance team before pledging support.\nDorchester County, meanwhile, did not provide a letter of support. Lenny Pfeffer, president of the Dorchester County Council, pointed to the county's Dorchester Career and Technology Center.\nHe also said money is tight in the county because of The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, an ambitious public education program that many county school districts are grappling with affording.\nBut in Talbot County, council members expressed support for the project and voted unanimously to send the letter of intent.\n\"I'm so happy that this is coming,\" council President Chuck Callahan said. \"We definitely need it for all these counties. And it couldn't be better timing for all these trades, that's for sure. We definitely lack trades. … It's going to make a difference in 10 years. It's probably going to make a difference in five once it's up and going.\"\nTom McCall contributed reporting to this story. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Mentors calling for more volunteers\n\n July 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 570\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot Mentors has seen a decrease of over 34% in mentor volunteers since the pandemic. So, staff is coming up with creative solutions to assist as many children as possible.This over 25-year-old organization has been providing students across Talbot County the opportunity to create connections, obtain academic support and develop skills for their future.\nKentavius Jones, executive director of Talbot Mentors, said prior to the pandemic mentor numbers were as high as 71 volunteers. But since the pandemic, volunteer numbers have consistently stayed between 50 to 60 mentors.\n\"One of the crucial parts of a relationship is actual interaction,\" Jones said. \"So COVID shut that down. … we just been trying to ramp up recruitment, but also being conscious about it. We want the right relationships, not just any relationship … It's meaningful connections and meaningful relationships. So recruitment looks a little bit different than it used to.\"\nJones said the organization has piloted a peer-to-peer program, pairing high schoolers with elementary school students.\nJones said there is an abundance of positive research about results seen through peer-to-peer programming. A similar program run by the Texas Education Foundation found that student mentoring resulted in a reduction in substance use, an increase in academic performance, a reduction of absences and truancy, a reduction of discipline referrals to the school office, and an increase in positive decision-making skills and risk resiliency.\nBut most importantly, Jones said, it has allowed for more mentor pairs to develop amid the dip in volunteer numbers.\nAn additional program that has assisted the organization is the Scholars program. This program exists through a collaborative effort with Building African American Minds and Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center and aims to help high school students achieve their academic goals through tutoring, assistance with college admissions, and help researching and applying for scholarships.\nJennifer Kott, a college success manager for the Scholars Program, said the program is aimed at first-generation students and students from marginalized communities, to whom they can provide greater access resources than may be available to them.\n\"My scope is to help these students with the arsenal of my colleagues and the people here in the Easton community,\" Kott said. \"To provide programming for the students anywhere from premier life skills … to creatively putting together a vision board right. Sort of providing hope for these students, and that hope is sort of groomed throughout the duration of their four years in high school.\"\nJones and Kott are proud of the programs and services Talbot Mentors provides to students, but despite the creative solutions, they said the organization is still seeking traditional mentors.\nJoan Evans, a mentor for Talbot Mentors, said she has been working with the organization for about six years and was paired with a then third grader from Easton. The experience allowed her to show her mentee and herself new skills and experiences such as a fishing competition, kayaking and boating, she said.\nHer mentee is currently an \"almost sophomore\" and has become a part of her family and heart. Evans said she encourages anyone who is interested in being a mentor to take the leap and volunteer.\n\"Being a mentor does not take any particular skill,\" Evans said. \"It's providing a child with your time and attention ... Talbot Mentors is a wonderful community resource for making the connection between those children who could use another positive role model in their life with those adults who can give their time, encouragement and support.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Like a three-legged stool, the community as a whole must come together with MSDE and Maryland READS for success to stand up, she said.\nMaryland READS recently wrapped up its summer series convenings to build networks and establish planning networks across the state, according to Maryland READS member Fred Curtis.\nThe READ Strong conveyings in Baltimore City and Queen Anne's and Montgomery counties saw stakeholders from a variety of different sectors, nonprofit executives, school board members and educators, he said.\nThese meetings provide ideas for a backbone of how to establish strong reading ecosystems rooted in the science of reading, he said. County convenings are instrumental in helping assist in sort of planning these efforts to bring people together and identifying what private ecosystems look like throughout different jurisdictions.\n\"For us, local experience, local expertise and relationships truly matter and they are imperative,\" Curtis said.\nMaryland READS will compile the data from the meetings for implementing feedback and continuous improvement, he said.\nOther events on the horizon for Maryland READS include additional READ Strong Network meetings in the fall, Happy Hour Conversations, and upcoming discussions to revolve around upcoming testing score releases.\nThe board expressed gratitude for the work of Maryland READS as a reminder of the individuals dedicated to the reading proficiency of all students and looked forward to progress.\nMaryland READS is actively recruiting for new board members for representation throughout the state and is accepting recommendations for its Expert Advisory Committee.\nMore information about Maryland READS, including its complete report on the state literacy crisis, can be found at https://marylandreads.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "You are what you read at the Talbot County Free Library\n\n August 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 729\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Ralph Waldo Emerson famously claimed, \"A man is what he thinks about all day long.\" Modern-day foodies have come up with something similar, if slightly more prosaic: \"You are what you eat.\"Both maxims are, I suppose, to one degree or another, true.\nIn my own case, two streams seem to have moved through my life, building and eroding as they went. The first of these has been, of course, life itself, the experiences of love and rejection, success and failure, learning and loss that, in toto, affect and effect a life.\nBut in my case, and surely that of any lover of the written word, there is that second, somewhat less obvious current: one's reading material.\nI'll never forget the uneasiness I experienced when, upon entering sixth grade, I detected an unexpected shift in the behavior of my peers. Boys I had known and played hide-'n-seek with since first grade were suddenly putting Brylcream in their hair, flirting with girls and talking about cars.\nWhen I compared the great loves of my life (sandlot baseball, fishing, games of kick-the-can and ghost-at-midnight) with these new pursuits, I found the latter decidedly wanting. Why would anyone want to worry about what their hair looked like when they could go outside and climb a tree?\nLooking back on it now I realize I was, at ten years of age, just old enough and smart enough to suspect what was being asked of me: that I turn my back on the joys of boyhood and march blindly into what looked to me like a minefield of grown-up responsibility. Peter Pan could not have asked for a better recruit.\nAnd so it was that, in my last year of elementary school, I consciously rebelled against my fellow students' desire to grow up before their time. Taking Huck Finn as my model of the boyhood I wished to preserve, I began wearing a straw hat and took to bicycling through the neighborhood with a cane-pole slung across my handle bars.\nI was too young to realize that, even in this, I was showing the first signs of growing up. Instead of imitating, as I had for years, TV cowboys and WW2 combat soldiers, I was imitating a character out of a book.\nIt was a formula that would serve, and sometimes disserve, me all my life.\nAs a teen I read Hemingway, took up hunting and, to my shame, began to speak disparagingly of men I deemed unmanly. As a young adult, I read Henry Miller, rented a room in a flophouse and adopted a bohemian lifestyle.\nIt was probably a combination of both authors' influence that drove me, at 24, to Santa Fe. In those days, before Ralph Lauren discovered it, New Mexico's capital still had a sleepy foreign air to it … and I couldn't afford a flight to Paris.\nIt was during my second spring in the Land of Enchantment that — thanks to the paperback copy of Joyce Cary's \"The Horse's Mouth\" I saw protruding from her purse — I was able to work up the courage to approach the most beautiful girl in town. I give Cary's protagonist, Gulley Jimson, another of my literary alter egos, full credit for introducing me to the woman who would become my wife.\nMelissa, in turn, introduced me to Virginia Woolf and, for the first time in my life, I found myself trying not so much to imitate a character from fiction as to imitate the fiction itself, to write descriptions true enough to life that a character like Mrs. Ramsey might (I prayed) emerge from my scribblings.\nThere have been other writers whose talents I have emulated and envied — Alice McDermott, Wendell Berry, Arundhati Roy and Graham Swift, to name a few — and I still come across characters worthy of imitation as well (Berry's Burley Coulter always springs to mind), so that now, at 72 years of age, I can even wonder how much of my life has been of my own making, and how much a mere product of literature.\nWhich leads me to the following conclusion: If we must be careful about what we think about all day, as it presages what we will become, then we must be equally careful about what we read.\nThe Talbot County Free Library is many things — archive, lending library, refuge, incubator, lecture hall, community hub. But it is also, fundamentally, a forging-place of the soul. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I would carefully vet those candidates to determine if their intent is to infiltrate the school system with the MFL doctrine.\nTwo things strike me as ironic — Bridget Ziegler's promoting family values and her simultaneous involvement in a sordid scandal and the MFL manifesto which never mentions the rights of children.\nSHARON HARRINGTON\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland Corps, Service Year Option graduates reflect on their experiences\n\n August 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 530\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In July, Maryland Corps and the Maryland Service Year Option graduated its first class of around 235 people.The state-run programs have allowed people to gain experience and crucial contacts for their next step in their careers and learn the invaluable lesson about giving back to their communities, graduates said.\nOne of these graduates, Brad Krantz of St. Michaels, described the program as life changing.\n\"I was hired by Talisman Therapeutic Riding up in Grasonville. I am working on my certification to be a therapeutic riding instructor,\" Krantz said.\nHe worked with recreational riders and with special needs people under a senior mentor at Talisman. He teaches two to seven classes a day. Noel Douglas, who is the executive director at Talisman, told him about Maryland Corps. Three days later, he was enrolled.\n\"I really found my calling helping other people selflessly. It has been a transformative experience interacting with the Maryland Corps and the Service Year Option,\" Krantz said.\nHe said that it set him up for success and helped get him across the finish line even when the program got hard.\nKrantz has been offered a full-time position at Talisman.\n\"Just this last week, we had an incredible veterans retreat of active Special Forces operators. What an experience talking with these true American heroes and seeing the healing that was taking place immediately as soon as they met the horses. I feel so blessed and grateful that I get to do this every day. It is awesome to get to see all the smiles,\" Krantz said.\nKranz is a graduate of the Maryland Corps, a service opportunity launched by the state last year for people of all ages.\nMembers earn a minimum of $15 dollars an hour working in organizations that provide job training and professional development. Program partnerships with both Maryland's Historically Black Colleges and Universities and community colleges provide an additional level of collaboration and support for members, in addition to alignment with skilled trades and apprenticeship programs to facilitate transition into continued education or the workforce.\nThe program was rolled out alongside the Service Year Option, a similar program targeted at recent high school graduates.\nEmma Bush, a Service Year Option graduate from Salisbury, said her participation in the program helped her build skills that will help her in her future career.\n\"There was time management, resume building, how different personalities in the workplace can play into different scenarios. I loved the financial trainings,\" Bush said.\nShe ended up as a school liaison for the third through fifth grade classroom leader at the Epoch Dream Center is Salisbury.

    "content": "Chef tours: learning the story of Chesapeake Bay seafood\n\n August 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 500\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n KENT NARROWS — On Tuesday morning, the Maryland Department of Agriculture hosted a tour to educate chefs and local organizations on the story and ecology of the region's seafood.The hope for the chef tours was to educate chefs from the region on seafood from the Bay, including wild-caught blue catfish, striped bass, crabs, oysters and other processed seafood.\nRepresentatives from several organizations were in attendance, including the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Oyster Recovery Partnership and Maryland Food Bank.\nThe tour began with pastries and coffee before loading all attendees onto a boat chartered by Off Da' Hook, a local fishing charter providing tours across the Chesapeake Bay. Touring through the waters of Kent Narrows, countless boats and watermen were harvesting crabs and oysters in the vicinity.\nKristin Hanna, director of special projects for the Maryland Department of Agriculture, said educational tours such as the chef tour are important in supporting watermen and the local economy.\n\"It helps people tell a story,\" Hanna said. \"So when you're a restaurant, you are competing with so many other restaurants, and everyone really cares about the food they're serving, and this (tour) gives them another story to share about how they're helping the Chesapeake Bay, whether they're serving the blue catfish or crab or oysters. We're supporting a legacy of watermen, which is historical to our state, and that matters.\"\nAfterwards, the group was taken on a tour of the historic Harris Seafood, one of the last remaining packing houses on Ken Narrows and the last full-time shucking house in the state.\nDuring the tour, attendees were shown the quick-paced crab packing process, the oyster preservation process and the various differences between female and male blue crabs.\nZach Jeffries, a sourcing manager for Maryland Food Bank, said the Maryland Food Bank started ordering blue catfish a few years ago through the Local Food Purchase Assistance program, a program that provides funds to purchase food to support local, regional and underserved producers.\n\"It was very educational,\" Jeffries said. \"I've worked … with the state of Maryland to fight invasive species, but oysters, crab harvesting, it was all very educational … and extremely fascinating. You learn things you never learned before about the lifespan of oysters and crabs that blows your mind.\"\nToward the end of the event, attendees were treated to a seafood lunch at Harris Crab House, where they feasted on to crab dip, oysters and a variety of different entrees including a crab cake sandwich and a fried oyster sandwich.\nChris Jones, an invasive fish biologist for the Maryland Department of National Resources, said it's important to educate the public about the wildlife in the Chesapeake Bay for the protection of native species.\n\"The Chesapeake is a very unique ecosystem, and these invasive species pose a threat to a lot of our native species,\" Jones said. \"They are out-competing some of our native species … Invasive fishes in general are posing a threat because they are competing with other species, and they're taking away from species that are important to the bay.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For older kids, there was a mechanical bull.\nThe Reger Pavilion had live music. Everything from the old-timey country sound of the Jone's Brothers to the foot stomping Amish Outlaws and '80s-inflected The Reagan Years.\nThere were lots of competitions to show younger community members' efforts to raise dairy cows, goats, swines, horses, rabbits and beef.\nJody Neal, Caroline County FFA Advisor and ag teacher at Caroline Career and Technology Center had lots of students participating in fair contests.\n\"I have nine kids showing animals today. I have kids showing sheep, swine, market goats and breed goats,\" Neal said.\nThe students raise their animals for a year leading up to the fair. After all that effort, the animals ended up at the livestock auction on Saturday night. This sale funds the students' project for next year. The pork can go back into the school system and is served in the lunch line.\nSkyler Blunt, a participant in the swine competition, said it was rewarding to show a year's worth of work.\n\"I have two Hereford barrows and one Yorkshire gilt,\" Blunt said. \"The best part is the accomplishment that the fair brings you and getting to show people your project for the year.\"\nEmma Boyle, 18, who had just graduated from high school, said, \"I am showing two crossbred pigs. I have been doing this since I was five. I love it. This is my last year. My pigs are named Buzz and Woody.\"\nBarbara Carrow, who was announcing the swine show, is co-leader of Pure Country 4-H Club. She has 62 kids in her Caroline County chapter. They showed at least 50 swine at the contest.\n\"I love working with young people, and I love animals. It teaches them responsibility and how to interact with adults other people. It gives them confidence,\" Carrow said.\nWandering in the crowd was a princess — the Dairy Princess.\nCaroline Kimball of Queen Anne's County High School wears a sash and a tiara.\n\"I am the Eastern Shore Dairy Princess because I represent the dairy industry. I like educating people about the dairy industry. You can add a dairy product to all three meals of the day. I like chocolate milk after practice. I want to major in animal science,\" Kimball said.\nThe judge, Gabe Zepp of Carroll County, picked first, second and third place winners. With every participant, win or lose, he offered instruction on how to improve.\n\"I want to see these hogs with their heads up at all times. Head placement. I want to see that they are comfortable with a whip. Nice and in control of the hog,\" Zepp said.\nNavonne Owen, 4-H Educator for Caroline County, said, \"They have all worked so hard on their projects and this is the time to shine. They are all doing an excellent job. They are resilient and flexible and they are learning so many life skills from the project.

Considerations of the working policy include aspects such as curriculum adoption, assessment data, analysis, early warning systems, intervention and accountability.\nThe proposed policy aims to help the State Board of Education clarify and develop the more rigorous requirements already embedded in state statutes, according to Deann Collins, deputy state superintendent, and Tenette Smith, executive director of literacy programs and initiatives.\nThe proposed policy emphasizes the importance of economic issues and addressing literacy at a young age, Collins said.\nThe drafters welcomed feedback from a multitude of stakeholders, as well as reviewed other state policies, Smith said.\nAnother important aspect was ensuring the policy could articulate goals and align with the Blueprint for Maryland's Future's goals for improving literacy outcomes, she said.\nAchievement gaps in literacy persist across state demographics, according to Collins. Research suggests \"reading is an economic issue as well as an education issue,\" Smith said.\nMany Maryland students are not meeting reading grade level expectations \"and this gap has profound implications for the overall academic success and future and their future opportunities,\" she said.\nAccording to the 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 31% of Maryland students scored at proficiency levels or advanced, \"Which means a staggering 69 percent of our students did not reach proficiency,\" Smith said.\nThese findings underscore the urgent need for a unified comprehensive approach to ensure that all students develop strong reading skills early in their education to support their long-term academic success and high school graduation, she said. Research from the Annie E. Casey Foundation emphasized the critical importance of early reading proficiency.\n\"88% of students who failed to earn a diploma were struggling readers in third grade,\" Collins said.\nThe stakes are even higher for children living in poverty and are from a minority, according to Smith, who face a eight times more likelihood of not graduating on time if they lack reading proficiency by third grade.\nFour major components of the comprehensive literacy policy draft spotlight teacher support, assessment and parent notification, instruction and intervention, and retention and intervention.\n\"By improving literacy outcomes we can enhance the economic and social wellbeing of our communities,\" she said.\nAreas for additional consideration include addressing staffing models and class sizes, strategic training as well as how to hold students accountable, Collins said.\nThe draft policy is still in its early stages, and the department was grateful for stakeholders and partner collaboration to spotlight where work needs to be focused, she said.\nWith over 900 responses collected already, the office of the superintendent continues to receive input and feedback can be submitted at the MSDE website.\nNo final decision has been made regarding the policy and additional work is needed to finalize a timeline. Another revisited policy is expected to be presented for board action at a later date.\n\"This is just the beginning,\" Wright said.\nPublic comment about the literacy policy is expected, and the MSBOE will next meet Aug. 27.\nMore information about the MSDE can be found at marylandpublicschools.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Middle school and elementary school students will not be able to use their phones at any time during the school day, and the latter are advised to not even bring their devices to school.\n\"We're putting faith in our students and staff that they will work hard to follow this,\" Chief of Staff Dale Farrell said.\nTeachers will not be able to use their cellphones during instruction and administrators will only be permitted to use school-issued cellphones.\n\"We realize this is a heavy lift,\" Farrell said of staff members. \"Many hands make light work, so we're making sure that all staff know the expectation to uphold, model and enforce these expectations.\"\nFor the first offense in high school, the phone will be confiscated until the end of the day and the incident recorded.\nA second offense will warrant the confiscation of the phone until the end of the day when only a parent or guardian can pick it up, and the incident recorded as a Code 802, \"Inappropriate Use of Personal Electronics,\" in the student's discipline record.\nIn addition to cellphones, devices such as tablets, earbuds and wearable technology such as smartwatches and fitness trackers are also included in the policy.\n\"If your phone is taken, don't expect it back at lunch,\" Director of Student Services Cheryl Long said. \"It's gone for the entire day.\"\nThree or more offenses will include the above, as well as a Code 702 (insubordination) and a one-day in-school service.\nStudent refusal of any of the above offenses may also result in additional codes and/or discipline.\nFor a first offense, middle school students will have phones taken until the end of the day when they can pick them up, and a second offense the phone will only be released to a parent or guardian, similar to high school consequences.\n\"The research is staggering,\" Smith said. \"There is no such thing as multi-tasking. People think they are multi-tasking but they're not, they're just task switching. Your brain does one thing at a time.\"\nFor the first three days of school only, which begins Wednesday, Aug. 21, cellphones will be returned to middle school and high school students at the end of the school day.\nElementary school students will have their phones confiscated and only released to a parent or guardian.\nStaff members should not be using their phones during instructional time and offenses are as follows: A first offense will constitute an investigation and verbal warning, second offense carries an investigation and written warning, while a third time will be investigated with a written letter of reprimand.\nStudent school board member Hannah Heisler asked about an instance where if a student's laptop would not work, would they be able to use their phone to access school-related documents.\n\"Then what we would address would be getting them a laptop that would work instead of using the phone,\" Long said. \"We don't want to start taking the phones out.\"\nSmith added he wants to avoid cases where exceptions would be made.\nThe policy will be communicated through home phone calls to parents and emails, morning announcements, a video and by posters throughout schools.\nSchool jurisdictions around the country have recently moved to ban cellphone usage in schools, including Calvert County. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Colman said a lot of those tutors were Dorchester County teachers, and so they were only able to provide services after school at night.\nElementary school students requiring services outside of school will still receive tutoring as the Edmentum agreement is only for secondary students in the district.\nUnder the agreement, Dorchester County schools will be able to offer secondary students enrollment in the Edmentum courses on an as-need basis.\nColman said the service will cost $200 per student per course. She said she doesn't know exactly how much it will cost the district in total as that is dependent on how many students will need to enroll, but she estimates the total cost will be somewhere around $100,000.\n\"I don't know if we'll use that much or we'll need more,\" she said. \"Based on our students, last year, we would have needed more than $100,000, but we're going to see how that goes right now.\"\nThe district will get billed monthly for up to $100,000 for the service.\nAt the meeting, board Vice President Talibah Chikwendu asked about funding the service and how the district will pay for it if costs go over budget. Colman said some money can be moved from the budgeted line item for home hospital services tutor stipends and the district can also use Title IV or Title V funds.\nNEW SCHOOL YEARAt the end of the meeting on Thursday, board members wished everyone in the district a great start to the school year.\n\"Parents, you're about to turn over your kids to us, and we're going to give them our very best,\" board President Sheri Hubbard said.\nFor Dorchester County Public Schools first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and ninth graders, the first day of school will be Sept. 3. For seventh, eighth, 10th, 11th and 12th graders, the first day of school will be Sept. 4. For pre-K and kindergarteners, the first day of school will be Sept. 5.\nSuperintendent Jymil Thompson said he thinks the district is off to a great start to the school year. He said the professional development that teachers have been receiving has been \"excellent.\"\n\"I just think the whole team has energy,\" he said. \"Because I think that everyone is focusing on what we're in the business of doing. And that is instruction.\"\nSince becoming interim superintendent in March and then superintendent in June, Thompson has talked about the need to increase the district's ranking from 23rd to 15th in the state.\n\"I just want to make sure we keep the main thing the main thing,\" he said at the end of the meeting, \"and that's moving from 23rd to 15th.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The STEAM camp sessions were offered free of charge to the young students and included snacks and refreshments. They only needed to bring their imagination.\nSTEAM programs integrate science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics to foster a more holistic approach to education. The interdisciplinary approach encourages creativity and critical thinking, enabling students to engage in hands-on, real-world problem solving.\n\"In the library's STEAM camp, volunteer leaders Vivi Morris, Van Tran and Mia Mazzeo, who created the program, blended artistic expression with analytical skills to make learning fun,\" said Easton Library Youth Coordinator Laura Powell. \"The children who participated learned to collaborate across various disciplines, nurturing both their logical reasoning and creative potential.\"\nStarting with a traditional STEAM approach, Morris, Tran and Mazzeo adapted and designed the program to best suit the youngsters who were attending each week of camp. The first session hosted 20 6-to-8-year-olds and the second had 20 9-to-12-year-old attendees. Both sessions were at capacity.\nOver the course of each week, the camper groups tackled a number of projects that required individual effort as well as cooperation within each camper team. Each day brought a new menu of activities — everything from tie-dyeing shirts and print-making tote bags to pass and paint or creating fruit art.\n\"The strategy of our STEAM program was to break the campers up into small groups so they could learn to both interact effectively with each other and apply the skills each camper had,\" said Alanna Peerman, library staff assistant. \"Each table of five campers had at least one volunteer High School student to guide and assist the campers.\"\n\"The campers particularly enjoyed making slime, as well as piecing together a Hex bug maze and racing the Hex bugs,\" said Mia Mazzeo. Two \"cooking through chemistry\" exercises were the highlights of each week. Van Tran added \"to watch each camper make ice cream by hand and cook s'mores using the sun was so much fun for all of us!\"\nVivi Morris agreed. \"The collaboration and teamwork was so 'chill,'\" she said. \"By the end of each week, we saw a community of learners, helping each other, enjoying each other's company, and being so excited as each group completed their activities and projects.\"\nThe enthusiasm was apparent by the students and parents alike. Two STEAM participants, Charlotte and Emmett McGrogan of St Michaels, loved every minute of their camp experience. Emmett, 9, attended the second session and especially enjoyed making slime. \"Doing crafting stuff was my most favorite activity,\" Emmett said. \"I can't wait to come back to STEAM Camp next summer.\"\nThe McGrogans' mom, Katie Willis, also gave the program rave reviews. \"As with many full-time working parents, my kids have been in a variety of summer programs — STEAM camp, which was free of charge, was hands down one of the very best,\" Willis said. \"The structure of STEAM camp each week was age appropriate, well organized and kept my kids engaged and busy the whole time. They want to go again next year, most definitely.\"\nThe Council of Friends, now celebrating its 50th anniversary, had the three camp leaders present their ideas last spring to the Council, which did not hesitate to offer the funds needed to provide the best experience for the campers. Based on the success, FOL President Emilie Knud-Hansen said \"there is no question we will fund next year's camp.\"\nInformation on the Library's upcoming STEM Festival can be found at tcfl.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lack of funding a 'recipe of frustration'\n\n August 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STAFF REPORTS | Section: News \n \n 1210\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Upwards of 200 individuals gathered at the Queen Anne's County Public Schools Board of Education building in solidarity of Queen Anne's County Education Association members raising their voices against proposed employee layoffs as the board held a closed executive session Aug. 20.\"We teach our students to collaborate and talk together, well, let's walk the walk,\" Education Association President Cecilia Mitchell said about the assembly.\nMarching from Centreville Elementary School to the building at 202 Chesterfield Avenue, teachers, parents, students, supporters and members of the education union wore \"red for ed\" against cuts proposed in an effort to balance the district's budget.\nAccording to the meeting's agenda on the board website, the closed session was held \"To consult with counsel to obtain legal advice; To conduct collective bargaining negotiations or consider matters that relate to the negotiations.\"\nCreating \"joyful noise,\" as Mitchell put it, the rally attendees carried signs of support for school staff and verbally chanted against cuts. In front of the building, participants inscribed chalk messages on the sidewalk.\n\"People love the school systems here. The future lives in that building,\" Mitchell said, pointing to nearby Centreville Elementary.\n\"It's deeply frustrating that QACPS wants to cut some of our lowest-paid educators who work directly with our students, and at the start of the year, no less. We don't know how many people, or what job titles,\" Mitchell said in a statement ahead of Tuesday's rally. \"There are any number of ways to deal with budget problems, but not if you won't talk to your educators.\"\nAccording to a press release issued by the Association, they were notified on Aug. 14 of the potential layoffs of \"an unknown number of QACPS support staff, who are among the lowest-paid employees in QACPS.\"\nThe Association seeks the superintendent and school board to address the budget shortfall before pushing it on to employees, Mitchell said.\nThe layoffs announcement came after the school district asked Queen Anne's County educators on Aug. 12 to accept five unpaid furlough days during the 2024-25 school year.\nThe educators association said they asked for documentation to justify the furloughs and were \"sent no response nor documentation, and then refused to meet on any of the dates offered to discuss the matter.\"\nSeeking budget transparency, the Association has filed a formal information request, with questions including where the money was going, and what is being done that doesn't involve cutting positions, according to Mitchell.\n\"So, we just have two questions for Dr. Saelens. First, why are you asking us to cut our salaries if you won't ask the county for additional funding, and second, why won't QACPS answer our questions about the budget crisis like the law requires?\" Mitchell said.\nOther measures needed to be exhausted first before the proposed Reduction In Force and layoffs of essential support staff, she said.\nMitchell highlighted the effect layoffs would have on the livelihood of support staff, who ensure the optimal running of the school, while making up the smallest portion of school system employees, \"And they make the least amount of money,\" she said.\nAccording to a statement from Superintendent Patricia Saelens, the school system sought to balance the budget through attrition.\nSaelens noted the \"severely underfunded Blueprint For Maryland' Schools, coupled with overall inflation has created a recipe of frustration\" — a deficit that Queen Anne's County is not alone in facing, she said.\nAs a result of that lack of attrition there is still a current shortfall of two million dollars. Saelens wrote in a letter to staff on Aug. 19, \"This summer, we have worked to do a detailed budget analysis and determine what could be cut to put those funds into salaries. We have identified numerous items to help reduce the budget shortfall. We will cut scanning, tutoring and locally funded conferences. We will reduce our legal line item. We will cut school block grants by 10%.\"\nAdditionally Saelens wrote the district is canceling the Cenergistic Energy contract, and repurposing the staff tuition reimbursement line. \"While these measures will help, it is simply not enough to balance the budget,\" she stated, \"Under Maryland Law, a local board of education is prohibited from carrying a budget deficit.\"\nSaelens contends the district met with the union on July 18 and 31 to discuss a retirement incentive and potential furlough days. The retirement incentive was not successful as only two employees took advantage, still leaving them under the attrition necessary to balance the budget.\nTogether with the union, Saelens said they selected dates that purposely would not impact student days. \"We also determined the proposed furlough days would be for all employee units, including the superintendent and all administrative staff. These proposed five days would have avoided the need to reduce any member of our staff,\" she said, \"We know that each of our employees are vital to the successes of students. It was our intention to keep our staff whole.\"\nSaelens said they provided the union with all the information they requested within 24 hours, meeting again on Aug. 6 and sharing a draft MOU regarding proposed furlough days.\nGiven the upcoming start of the school year, we requested that they provide us with their decision by Aug. 12, Saelens said. The union responded in writing informing leadership that they \"formally decline Queen Anne's County Public Schools proposal of furlough days for the 2024-2025 school year\".\nAs a result, Reduction In Force (RIF) letters were issued on Aug. 14, in accordance with the RIF process outlined in the negotiated agreement, Saelens concluded.\nWhether proposed furlough dates or RIF, the teacher's union has a ratified contract based on an offer the BOE presented to the union that was accepted, according to Mitchell.\n\"We must take care of each other,\" she said.\nShowing support for fellow union members and district bus drivers, Tony Mansfield stated the rally was a \"good start\" and sought collaborative efforts to come up with a budget that does not include reductions and a solution that honors the contract ratified in June.\nSchool psychologist Julie Rock, of Matapeake Middle School and Kent Island Elementary School, stated it was her job to advocate for students and the rally highlighted the invaluableness of the various support needed within the walls of the schools. \"Right now, the students that need us the most are going to be losing the support,\" Rock said.\nStanding alongside QACEA was Lori Hrinko, President of Cecil County Classroom Teachers Association. \"This isn't about you wanting more, this is about what's right for our kids,\" Hrinko told the crowd.\nHrinko encouraged everyone to be involved in their school districts, as students represented the future generations.\nQACEA is a local affiliate of the Maryland State Education Association (MSEA), which in turn is an affiliate of the National State Education Association, and Mitchell voiced appreciation of the organizations' support.\nWorking to promote change through action, Mitchell hoped to inspire students of all ages and showcase that change is possible.\nMitchell noted issues cannot be addressed by avoiding dialog or shifting blame, \"Problems can only be solved with conversation, creative solutions and direct contact,\" she said.\nMoving forward, Mitchell seeks to have all groups unite with the same underlying goal: identify the best interests for the good of students. \"[Working] together; real numbers, real decisions,\" Mitchell said.\nMore information about QACEA can be found at https://qacea.org.\nThe Board of Education will next meet for a regular meeting Sept. 4 at 6 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One side includes a screenshot from the U.S. News & World Report's web page on the district's finances. \"And what are taxpayers getting for all this money?\" the flyer reads.\nOn the other side, it reads: \"Despite all of this spending, math proficiency for students in Talbot County stands at a dismal 17.2%, well below the state average. It doesn't add up! With all this taxpayer money being spent, what are they teaching our kids?\"\nTalbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi briefly addressed the mailers during an Aug. 14 Board of Education meeting.\n\"There (were) inaccurate monetary figures on that card, number one,\" Pepukayi said. \"Yes, I will say we have work to do in the area of math, and that's one of our priorities.\"\nThe superintendent said there will be a Board of Education work session in September to show recent state testing data that is currently embargoed. The state average math proficiency rate for the 2022-23 school year was about 25%, according to the Maryland Department of Education.\nReturn addresses indicate the mailers were sent by Pay Attention America Inc., with an address listed as 1000 N. West St. in Wilmington, Delaware.\nThe group's registered agent is listed online through the Delaware Department of State as The Corporation Trust Company, also located in Wilmington. The company offers registered agent services and has provided these services to more than 300,000 businesses, according to its website.\nRepresentatives from The Corporation Trust told The Star Democrat that Pay Attention America is newly formed, and thus, no contact information can be publicly provided since the group hasn't filed an annual tax report.\nThough not confirmed to be behind the mailers, a website with a domain of payattentionamerica.com describes itself as a \"group of concerned citizens across the United States of America joined to combat the decline of our beloved country.\" No contact information or addresses are listed on the website.\nAs of Tuesday evening, The Star Democrat has not received a response from a contact form submitted on the website payattentionamerica.com.\nResident Hilary Spence received the flyer in her mailbox on Aug. 9. She was most struck by \"the anonymity\" of the mailers for such a small community. \"It's hard to have dialogue with nobody to (have) dialogue with,\" she said.\n\"That's what offends me the most, to be honest, as a local resident supportive of public schools,\" Spence said. \" … It's like if you have something to say to me … say it to my face.\"\nEaston resident Shari Wilcoxon had a different stance on the mailers.\n\"I was actually pretty excited to see that someone was willing to tell the truth to the public,\" Wilcoxon said. \"Because I feel like most people have absolutely no idea of the state of the education system in Maryland.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This event not only contributes to the care of students of all ages, but it creates community for residents throughout Easton.\nBeth Anne Dorman, president and chief executive officer at For All Seasons, said the resource fair has become one of the largest community events in Easton, bringing together over 25 different organizations and over 1,700 people.\n\"We are really taking care of all of the kids in the ways that set them up for success,\" Dorman said. \"For school, mental health isn't just about our mental health and talk therapy, but it's also about making sure that children have what they need to be able to show up at the school year authentically and with some safety.\"\nIn addition to the school supplies provided by For All Seasons, dozens of organizations set up tables and provided rulers, pens, dental care kits, notebooks and over a hundred children's books.\nMarilou Russ, assistant director for Appleseed Books, said the organization provides free children's books to families across the Eastern Shore by collecting donated books.\n\"We come to programs and events throughout the counties on the mid shore, which would include Caroline, Talbot and now even Dorchester County, and then we give the children out the free books so that they have books,\" Russ said. \"Our belief is that they have their own collection of books that they can call their own.\"\nIncluded in the event, families had the opportunity to enjoy games, free Rita's Italian Ice, and arts and craft activities.\nMayra Casillas, an event attendee, said she just moved to the area and learned of the fair on Facebook. For Casillas, it seemed a great opportunity to engage with her new community and for her children to have fun.\n\"It's also great to have backpacks and a bunch of other school supplies,\" Casillas said. \"It helps families that don't have the income to buy for their kids.\"\nDorman said the event has grown significantly since its origin six years ago. It has reached the point where For All Seasons will be expanding the venue for next year since it has become too crowded for Idlewild Park. Dorman said she is proud of this event and the amount of people it assists.\n\"There are times where we have an opportunity to dig in a little bit deeper as a community,\" Dorman said. \"This is an example of when we think outside of the box, and we really think about the whole person when we're thinking about mental health. It gives us an opportunity to make a difference in a way that maybe is not going to happen in the four walls of an office, but this is real community outreach and community connection and partnership.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Family holding out hope for turf field project at Easton High\n\n August 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 695\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The prospects of an artificial turf field at Easton High School are uncertain as the school year approaches.Jen Hawley's 18-year-old daughter, Elgin, has been a champion of the turf field. Elgin asked for it to be added to the school district's budget request last year as part of her wish with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\nJen Hawley hoped to see the project take shape before Elgin left for college this summer. She asked Make-A-Wish to maintain its commitment to the project until July 31 before the nonprofit needed to begin working on a new wish for Elgin.\nTalbot County Public Schools received $1.5 million from the county meant to allocate towards outstanding capital projects this fiscal year, such as the turf field, which has an estimated price of $1.8 million.\nAt the end of July, Hawley said she was told the Board of Education is passing on partnering with Make-A-Wish for the turf field project.\n\"We're right back to where we started,\" Hawley said.\nIn mid-August of 2021, on the third day of field hockey tryouts, Elgin had an aneurysm on the field. It took almost two weeks after she collapsed before she began talking again, and it wasn't until February 2022 that she returned to school.\nElgin, who graduated this spring, hasn't been able to play field hockey since the aneurysm. When Make-A-Wish Mid-Atlantic granted her one wish, she asked for a turf field to be put in at Easton High.\nWith support from Make-A-Wish and a group of supporters known as \"Elgin's Army,\" the turf field was requested at a board meeting in July 2023 and later added to the budget by the board in December 2023.\nAt a Board of Education work session in June, President Emily Jackson said while she's a \"vocal proponent\" of the turf field project, she wasn't committed to allocating funds towards it this fiscal cycle.\n\"I am not necessarily saying, no, never let's not do it,\" Jackson said. \"But I'm saying that I think there are a lot of questions to be asked. Is turf the best option? Should we be going with really high-quality grass instead? What is going to cause the least number of injuries?\"\nThe board has not made an official decision allocating the $1.5 million. Capital projects that are vying for the funding, such as new auditorium lights at Easton High and a playground replacement at St. Michaels Elementary, total to around $3.3 million.\nHawley believes if the district had acted sooner and actively partnered with Make-A-Wish, the $1.8 million estimate for the turf field could have been significantly lowered by donations, as well as a potential contribution from a turf field supplier.\n\"Having Make-A-Wish on our team … we could've gotten the field for much less,\" Hawley said.\nCounty Council Member Dave Stepp has been a proponent of the efforts of Elgin's Army and a potential turf field installation during the past year.\n\"Just from the overwhelming support of coaches and players who have shown up to express interest in how great that would be for our local athletes, I think that speaks for itself,\" Stepp said.\n\"I do know that they do have funds in reserve that they can make up the difference between the $1.5 (million) that we had given this fiscal year and the cost of the actual estimate,\" Stepp said regarding the Board of Education. \"So they can do that at any time they're ready to do so, and I'm optimistic that they will, and I hope so personally sooner than later.\"\nLesli Creedon, president and CEO of Make-A-Wish Mid-Atlantic, said the organization is fully committed to providing Elgin another wish. Creedon said the average wish granted by Make-A-Wish Mid-Atlantic is around $10,000, and that the foundation was prepared to contribute around that mark toward a turf field installation.\n\"While I am disappointed that the BOE passed in the partnership with Make-A-Wish and do think (it's) shortsighted, I am hopeful that the county and its citizens will do more to support its young athletes and instill pride in our public schools,\" Elgin Hawley said in an emailed statement to The Star Democrat. \"And whatever they decide they continue to think of me and my story to move the field forward as a priority.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You're continuously trying to improve yourself, you're continuously investing in yourself, you're continuously investing in your students.\"\nHillyard, a Spanish and English second language math teacher at Easton High, and Steele, an instructional assistant for English second language students, both delivered speeches to the crowd.\n\"Each of us in this room plays an important role in our students' stories,\" Hillyard said. \"And it's our job and up to us to make that role a supporting one by always having their backs.\"\n\"This job has been the most rewarding experience in my life,\" Steele said. \"I have witnessed those students that start as ninth graders with very little English inspire me when I see them in the community after graduation.\"\nMany other awards were handed out during the event.

Some examples were staffing, transportation, dress code and student behavior.\n\"I believe in bite-sized chunks and taking it slow, so that it's not a lot and it doesn't seem overwhelming,\" Pepukayi said.\nShe noted that adding mentors for incoming teachers and math coaches has been successful for the district. Pepukayi said the district will begin working on a new four-year strategic plan, as the current plan wraps up in 2025.\nAt the end of her speech, Pepukayi indicated the district is maintaining its three priorities of improvement heading into the 2024-2025 school year: academic equity in math, an \"engaging\" environment for students and staff, and recruiting and retaining a more diverse staff.\n\"We're going to stay the course with these three priorities as we continue to move into this next year of transforming and performing together,\" Pepukayi said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company is leading construction, which started Aug. 5.\nA short ceremony outside the school provided attendees insight into the renovations and what benefits will follow. Speakers included Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi, Principal Kari Clow, Talbot County Council President Chuck Callahan, Board of Education President Emily Jackson, Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers Executive Director Cristy Morrell and two students, Abdiel Santamaria and Laney Childress.\n\"This groundbreaking ceremony symbolizes not just the start of construction, but the beginning of a vision coming to life,\" Clow said. \"A vision of a school that will provide an environment where our students can thrive, learn and grow into the leaders of tomorrow.\"\nConstruction on the multimillion-dollar project is expected to take a couple years. The school was built in 1952 and last renovated in 1994.\nDuring Friday's groundbreaking ceremony, Pepukayi thanked the school's teachers and staff and emphasized safety is a top priority as the school year begins and construction continues.\n\"Together the Chapel District Elementary School staff has shown patience and flexibility to work with Whiting-Turner and associates, keeping safety a priority while the project moves forward,\" Pepukayi said.\nThe Talbot County Council allocated a projected $26.9 million in capital project funding to Talbot County Public Schools for the renovations. That funding is expected to span across both fiscal years 2025 and 2026.\nThis April, the state's Interagency Commission on School Construction unanimously approved a $3.8 million funding request for the project. Lisa Vaughn, capital project manager for the commission, said on Friday that the \"kids are worth every penny.\"\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, the project includes a full renovation of the existing building and around 16,000 square feet of additions. There will be additional learning space for the school, as well as the Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers site located in the building.\nThe school's media center is moving to the center of the building, and the playground is also under renovation.\nOn behalf of the board, Jackson thanked the county and state for funding the renovation.\n\"Funding these improvements for our cherished elementary school shows the collective commitment, not only to education, not only to rural education, but to rural education for our earliest learners,\" Jackson said. \"It does not go unappreciated or unnoticed.\"\nFollowing the ceremony, administrators, teachers, staff and students took turns shoveling the dirt to commemorate the beginning of construction. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With all the \"back-to-school\" sales, getting these things for the best price can be really time-consuming.\nOnce you have all those physical things ready, how do you prepare yourself and your child?\nIn her article \"How To Spiritually Prepare for Back To School,\" Shelby Turner suggests that we need to do more. She says that we need to commit to diligently praying for our children. We need to pray for their safety, friendships, academic success and character growth. We have to remember that school makes a massive impression on our children.\nHere are a few prompts and scriptures to help you:\nFor faith, pray Ephesians 3:14-19 and ask God to firmly establish your children in the love of Christ.\nFor friends, pray over them Romans 12:2 asking God to bring godly friends into their lives.\nFor academics, pray Proverbs 2:6 asking God to give them the passion they need to gain wisdom.\nFor character, pray Deuteronomy 31:6 praying that the Lord will give them the courage to try new things, make new friends and be a witness for you.\nAnd finally, for safety and success, pray Psalms 91:1 and Colossians 3:23 asking God to keep them safe and to work in all things not for man's glory for the glory of the Lord.\nSo, get the physical taken care of and continue to work on the spiritual daily for the entire 180 days of this school year. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Their nursing certification allows them to become licensed to serve as nurses in Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania.\n\"Our nursing graduates continue to distinguish our program with their accomplishments as clinicians and educators and through contributions to nursing research. We are honored to educate and train future nurses for our community,\" said Nancy Norman-Marzella, Cecil College's Dean of Health, Human and Business Sciences.\nAccredited by the Maryland Board of Nursing and the Accreditation for Education in Nursing, the program is considered a \"timely response\" to a report from the US Department of Health and Human Services warning of a national shortfall of 78,000 RNs by 2025.\n\"Cecil College's initiative to accelerate the training of new nurses is a strategic move to mitigate this issue and support the region's needs for nursing,\" the college stated Tuesday. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Plans to address test scores, cell phones shared by district staff at Moms for Liberty meeting\n\n August 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On Monday evening, Talbot County's chapter of Moms for Liberty, a nationwide conservative political organization, held a meeting with Sharon Pepukayi, superintendent of Talbot County Public Schools, and other district professionals.During this meeting, attendees shared their concerns about the state of education in Talbot County, including low math scores, and student cell phone use.\nJan Greenhawk, chapter chair for Moms for Liberty, expressed gratitude for the attendance of the district representatives, including Debbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools; Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent for school leadership and Student Success; and Vulieka Jarmon-Horsey, assistant superintendent of administrative services, systems and strategies.\n\"Y'all don't realize what a privilege it is to have a superintendent and a school board and her staff that will come in and talk to your group and answer questions,\" Greenhawk said. \"Believe me when I say that because I have friends who are chapter chairs on the western shore. That does not happen.\"\nGreenhawk noted there may be times \"we disagree, and that's okay, but we can talk through issues.\"\nDuring the meeting, Pepukayi shared news of a research-based math and English language arts curriculums that will be implemented in schools.\nIn addition to the new curriculum, the county has added some positions to help, such as math coaches. According to Pepukayi, while these changes are important, it is essential to roll it out slowly so as to not overwhelm teachers.\nPepukayi's emphasis on changes to the math curriculum comes after an anonymous countywide postcard was mailed to county residents criticizing Talbot County Public Schools.\nThe 14-by-8.5-inch, two-sided post cards were sent out to the residents of Talbot County last week. The flyers included a screenshot from the U.S. News & World Report's web page on the district's finances, and on the other side they shared that Talbot County students' math proficiency stands 17.2% below the state average.\nShari Wilcoxon, an attendee of the meeting, expressed concern over the postcards that were sent to residents. She told representatives in the meeting that there will be \"multiple other ones coming out.\"\nThe following morning, a second round of similar postcards arrived in residents' mailboxes. Instead of addressing math scores, this postcard addressed English proficiency, stating that 59% of students in third through eighth grade are not proficient in English.\nCELL PHONE USE\nDuring the question-and-answer portion of the meeting, several attendees asked for the district's overall stance on student cell phone usage during school hours. Pepukayi shared the district's policy on cell phone usage may be different from what is practiced in the classroom.\nPepukayi said the district is piloting a new program called YONDER as a way to limit cell phone usage in the classroom.\n\"It's a cell phone pouch, and what it is is a student comes into school, they put their cell phone in this pouch, and it locks,\" Pepukayi said.\nAccording to Pepukayi, the pouches will stay with the students and will be locked all day until they leave and press the pouch up against a magnet, which will allow them access to their cell phones.\nPepukayi said the roll out of the pouches have not begun yet. The district would need to communicate the plan with families and have a board presentation on it. The draft plan is to start rollout after Thanksgiving.\nRobert Jurrius, a math teacher at Easton Middle School, said it is difficult for students to stay off their cell phones, but it is made worse by parents who text their kids during school hours.\n\"I'm going to say with all authority that I can muster, (parents) need to break that addiction that you have to be able to reach a child every time anything occurs,\" Jurrius said.\nToward the end of the meeting, Pepukayi said it was important for her to take the time to talk to community groups and hear their concerns. It falls under the district's theme of \"transforming and performing together.\"\n\"I'm a big proponent of people knowing the facts, and number two, making sure we're partnering with anyone who wants to help our Talbot County Public students be successful,\" Pepukayi said. \"And so whatever that looks like, we'll partner and we'll talk about the issues.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You just have to be prepared.\"\nShe added that a move could be made as early as this fall.\n\"I'd love to stay here because of our history, but no matter where we are, we're still Leonard Hall,\" Anita Drury, a Leonard Hall graduate and historian of the school, said.\nIn January, the county commissioners voted to terminate the academy's lease as of June 30 this year.\nThe situation became even more awkward when a letter about the premature closing of the school was sent out at the time.\n\"I've heard the incredible impact the school has had in helping students turn their lives around,\" Commissioner Eric Colvin (R) said in January.\nThe commissioners eventually agreed to the month-to-month lease after the school temporarily closed following the January decision.\nOn Monday, Milan said, \"We recognize [the commissioners] have no ill will toward the school.\"\nThe academy had 40 students in January, but ended the school year with less than 10.\n\"It's been challenging,\" Drury said. \"We've gone through all the emotions you'd expect us to go through.\"\nDuring Leonard Hall's open house on Monday afternoon, Jemi Camlin of Charles County said her son Israel \"was just very dismissive, had a bad attitude and he used to talk back.\"\n\"He went from failing summer school to a 4.0 [GPA] in 18 months,\" at the Leonard Hall, Camlin said, adding he is now in his third year and a squad leader. \"I love just the discipline, I love the organization, that they can be more accountable, the family aspect and the small and individualized classrooms.\"\nMilan's son, eighth-grader Rex Bothwell, said he earned all Ds and Fs in public school, but after transferring to Leonard Hall had all As and one B so far.\n\"I like the etiquette and how they teach,\" he said. \"I like the establishment about the military and how they do things around here. I like how they establish classes and they give us a timely manner to us to get things done. It's really made an impact on my grades.\"\nLeonard Hall, which is a nonprofit that depends on funding from tuition and donations, currently has 15 students and six teachers.\n\"Right now we need to clear the air because there's a lot of misinformation out there,\" Milan said. \"A lot of people still think we're closed. [We want to] communicate the positive aspects and try and put that [last] year behind us ... We want to focus on the kids that are here today and make sure they have the best opportunity to learn in the military and academic environment we've established, regardless of the facility we're in.\"\nMilan added she would like to get enrollment up to 100, which she said \"is doable.\"\n\"If we could have a solid, stable year for these kids, I think that's probably the bigger impact,\" Milan said. \"We've all gone through the stages of frustration, of anger, of is this going to work, is it not going to work? Then we get calls from parents saying, 'We need you. My kids need Leonard Hall,' and that's what keeps us going.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "\"ArtScene | the Podcast\" kicks off new season, new school year\n\n August 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 413\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n \"ArtScene | The Podcast\" — which features Centreville Middle School art teacher Jackie Jablecki — launched a new episode Sept. 1 to kickoff the 2024-2025 school year.Jablecki shares her compelling journey from personal loss to professional triumph, illustrating how her passion for art and education has shaped her career and touched the lives of her students.\nJablecki began her teaching career at Kent Island Elementary before transitioning to middle school, and she has always felt a deep connection to art—a passion she inherited from her father, a skilled glass artist. Her path has been anything but straightforward, marked by significant personal challenges, including the loss of her father at a young age and her own battle with a rare genetic mutation, which led to life-altering surgeries. Despite these hurdles, Jablecki's love for adventure and art has driven her to excel in her career and inspire her students.\nIn this episode, Jablecki discusses the transformative power of art education, especially within a TAB (Teaching for Artistic Behavior) classroom. She shares how her student-centered approach empowers young artists to explore their creativity and develop confidence. Jablecki recalls a particularly touching success story about a seventh grade student who, initially struggling with a self-portrait assignment, ultimately produced work that exceeded all expectations—demonstrating the profound impact of perseverance and support in the classroom.\nJablecki also speaks about her involvement with the Art of Education University, where she recently completed her Master's degree and is involved in an exciting project documenting \"A Year in the Life of an Art Teacher\" as a YouTube Vlog series. This achievement, alongside her dedication to continuous professional development, underscores her commitment to providing the best educational experience for her students. Her enthusiasm for visual journaling and choice-based art education has made her classroom a haven for creativity, where every student is encouraged to trust the process and embrace artistic challenges.\nAn adventurer at heart, Jablecki also shares stories of her travels, including a recent trip through France and Spain. This experience, she says, was not just about seeing new places but about connecting her students with the wider world through the lens of art.\n\"ArtScene | The Podcast\" is dedicated to exploring the personal lives of our teachers, providing a glimpse into their world and the stories of who inspires our communities.\nListen to these inspiring stories on \"ArtScene | the Podcast\" by tuning in to \"ArtScene | the Podcast\" on Spotify or at: https://anchor.fm/artscene.

She also recently was able to take a ride in a C-130 military transport.\n\"I know I really want to be an F-35 pilot,\" she said.\nThe Civil Air Patrol held an open house Aug. 28 at the St. Mary's County Regional Airport, welcoming young potential members from the community.\n\"We're here to tell members of the general public about our program,\" Wing Cadet Program Director David Trick said of the CAP cadet program, which is open to members in Grade 6 through 21 years of age. \"Of course a lot of folks that are here this evening are here to hear about our cadet program [which offers] career exploration in the United States military as well as careers in aviation. It's a fantastic program that gives folks the opportunity to learn to fly, explore careers in aviation, perform search and rescue, perform community service and do a variety of other things that are beneficial to themselves and their community.\"\nCadets usually stay in the program, which is an auxiliary of the Air Force, from ages 12 to 17, though they are able to remain until they are 21. The program's core values are integrity, excellence, volunteer service and respect.\nThere are squadrons in Calvert, St. Mary's and Charles counties.\nThe program is exactly why Charles and Emma David stopped by with their 11-year-old daughter Amelia.\nCharles, who retired three months ago following a 20-year career in the U.S. Marine Corps and Army National Guard, said he and his wife found out about the CAP during a middle school orientation.\n\"We both kind of thought, 'This would be a great thing where we can do father-daughter things together,'\" he said. \"I think it's a great opportunity for students of all ages to be able to participate in their county, their community and have a hand in civil service.\"\nEmma David said she likes \"that they're giving children of this age structure, values and they're striving for excellence. Just to have that in a world of chaos to have something very structured like this and can instill good values in children for the future. I don't think you can go wrong with that.\"\nAmelia, who attends Margaret Brent Middle School, said she liked what she saw.\n\"I think it's amazing for kids to have an opportunity like this at such a young age to be able to have different opportunities like flying planes, getting to do emergency rescue service and getting able to survive in the wilderness for a week,\" she said. \"Getting to do all these fun things at 11 just sounds fun.\"\nInside, a large throng of parents and their children browsed through literature and listened to testimonies by current members.\nTaylor's brother Eric joined CAP before her and at first Taylor thought the idea of joining was a \"hard no.\"\n\"I didn't think I'd be interested in it or that it wouldn't be for me,\" the cadet master sergeant said. \"And then I learned I could fly and get my pilot's license and I thought, 'Oh, that's really cool.'\"\nEvelyn Roulhand's father was an F-18 pilot at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, and a friend suggested she check out the program.\n\"I know a lot of people where [the military aspect] was not their forte, but they came and really enjoyed it,\" said the 16-year-old St. Inigoes resident. \"There are so many branches in this program that it's almost a certainty you will find something.\"\nAnd does Roulhand even envision herself leaving the Civil Air Patrol after almost four years?\n\"No sir, I don't,\" she said.\nFor more information on the Civil Air Patrol, go to www.gocivilairpatrol.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "School lunches through the years\n\n September 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1055\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n School lunches have changed through the years, but students have always looked forward to that middle-of-the-day break.Talking with friends and sharing events and stories is most important to a young student who may have limited access to conversing with friends outside the school day. I know times have changed, but some policies have remained intact from my school days. I was an elementary student in the 1950s — no talking anywhere in that building. But during recess, we screamed and hollered until downtown Bishopville heard us.\nSchool lunch is important for students to have a successful day at school. Not all kids eat or even want breakfast — whether at home or the ones served at school each day, so a nutritious lunch is very important. Some students like to have packed lunches from home.\nNow what was packed in my lunch box? In the winter, Mom would sometimes put homemade soup, and in the spring she put Kool-Aid drink. The sandwiches were usually the favorite in the 1950s, bologna with mustard and sometimes cheese, but mostly bologna. Sometimes we took a homemade biscuit with a piece of fried ham leftover from supper the night before.\nLet's explore some lunches today's students like — either from home or the lunch line.\nBBQ CHICKEN CUPS1 roll of Pillsbury Grands biscuits (usually the Southern style works best but you can use any flavor your child likes), 3 lbs chicken breast, 1 cup chicken broth, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, barbecue sauce.\nPlace chicken breasts in the bottom of the crockpot. Pour chicken broth and seasonings over chicken. Cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3-4 hours. Remove chicken from the crockpot and shred with two forks. Mix with your favorite barbecue or hot sauce. Bake the biscuits according to directions, then immediately when they are done tear a biscuit in half and flatten it, place it into a muffin tin, top with chicken and shredded cheese, and bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes.\nPB&J APPLES2 apples, 1/4 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup jelly.\nSlice apples into ¼-inch rounds. Use a small cookie cutter to cut the core from the center of each slice. Spread peanut butter on jelly on half of the slices then cover with the remaining halves. This is one that you'll want to make in the morning so the apples don't brown overnight.\nPB&J SUSHI4 slices white bread, 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter, 1/2 cup grape jelly.\nRemove crusts from bread. Using a rolling pin, roll bread until very flat. Spread with peanut butter and jelly and roll tightly. Cut into 2-inch pieces and serve.\nPICKLE ROLL UPS4 slices of your child's favorite lunch meat, mustard or mayo, cheese, pickle wedge.\nSpread mustard or mayo on the slices of meat, layer some cheese then another layer of meat. Roll a pickle wedge up and pack tight. You can use any variety of meat, cheese or condiments in this dish.\nTURKEY CLUB ROLL UPS4 slices deli turkey, 2 tsp mayo, 2 slices cheddar (halved or quartered), 1/2 cup shredded or chopped lettuce, 1/2 tomato (sliced), 1/4 red onion (thinly sliced), 1/2 avocado (sliced), 4 slices cooked bacon, kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper.\nOn a clean work surface, place two slices of deli turkey and spread a thin layer of mayo on top. Top with 1 slice cheddar, half of the lettuce, tomato, red onion and avocado, and 2 slices bacon. Season generously with salt and pepper. Roll up and secure with a toothpick, then repeat with remaining ingredients.\nGRILLED CHEESE ROLL UPS8 thick slices of soft white bread, 1.5 cups finely grated cheddar, 2 tbsp melted butter.\nOne by one, slice the crusts off of each slice of bread, then use a rolling pin to flatten. Add a pinch of cheese to each slice, making sure you leave a small strip at the end to brush with butter. Tightly but carefully roll up each slice to the end, brush with butter, then roll shut and place seam-side-down. Brush all over with butter. Add roll ups to a dry pan seam-side-down over low-medium heat and fry until golden all over with the cheese starting to leak out. Use your tongs to frequently turn them. You may need to do this in two batches depending on the size of your pan.\nNUTELLA BANANA SUSHIThis recipe is by the single serving, so repeat as many times as you need.\nNutella, 1 banana, 1 whole wheat wrap.\nLay your wrap on a breadboard and slather with Nutella, Place the banana on top of your chocolate coating, Roll the wrap as you would sushi or a burrito and carefully slice into rolls.\nHAM, MAC N CHEESE MUFFINS2 cups of your favorite macaroni and cheese, 2 large eggs (beaten), 1 cup diced ham, 1/4 cup breadcrumbs + 2 tbsps. Combine macaroni and cheese with eggs, ham and 1/4 cup breadcrumbs.\nStir until well combined. Spray eight openings in a muffin tin with non-stick spray. Use an ice cream scoop to add 1/2 cup of mixture to each cup. Gently press mixture down with your fingers to flatten it into each cup. Sprinkle with additional bread crumbs. Bake in a 350-degree oven for 20-25 minutes depending on how soft or firm you prefer your muffins. Immediately remove from cups to cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate after 30 minutes of cooling.\nRICE KRISPIE PEANUT BUTTER BANANAS2 bananas, peanut butter, 1 cup of crispy rice cereal, foil or parchment paper so you don't have to wipe peanut butter smears off your counter.\nFirst peel the bananas and cut them into thirds. Then dump some cereal onto your wax paper, smear the bananas in peanut butter and roll the peanut butter bananas in the cereal.\nPEPPERONI PIZZA STICKS1 Pillsbury pizza crust, 40 pepperoni slices, 10 mozzarella cheese sticks, 2 tbsp butter, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp dried parsley, your favorite marinara sauce for dipping.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees. Spread pizza dough out on a lightly greased baking sheet. Cut the dough into 10 equal size rectangles. Arrange 4 pepperoni slices on each rectangle and top with a mozzarella cheese stick. Roll up the pizza dough, enclosing the cheese stick, pinching the seams closed. Melt the butter and add the garlic powder and dried parsley. Brush the pizza sticks with the butter. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This equates to a total county allocation of $75.1 million plus an additional $42.1 million in state funding, for a total operating budget of $118,400,000 for FY 25, according to Moran.\n\"However, the board is currently operating with a projected budgetary deficit just six weeks into FY 25 and there are concerns that this trend will continue to get worse in the coming years,\" he said.\nThe commissioners reiterated the audit was \"not a witch hunt\" but a means in which to support the Board of Education including assistance in identifying resources, guidelines, and best practices with the County's Finance Department and the Spending Affordability Committee.\nCommissioner Chris Corchiarino noted when things go wrong some people have a tendency to get caught up in the blame game and not put forth viable solutions.\n\"We want to fix things,\" he said.\nCommissioner Jack Wilson noted the audit would be a good first step and \"huge push toward transparency across the board\" and with the current fiscal state of Maryland, time was of the essence.\nCommissioner Phil Dumenil noted Superintendent Patrica Saelens, the Board of Education, and leadership have been \"more than cooperative\" regarding the endeavor and a review of the financial books.\nWith the Board of Education's next fiscal year budget process beginning soon, work is underway narrowing down potential firms to expedite the auditing process as quickly as possible, and no final schedule has been set, County Administrator Todd Mohn said.\nThe audit is capped not to exceed $100,000. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County pilots cell phone pouches in schools, other districts to follow\n\n September 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 610\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Some students in Caroline County are without access to their phones to begin the school year due to new cell phone restrictions.Caroline County Public Schools began a policy where students at Colonel Richardson Middle School and Lockerman Middle School put their phones in locked pouches during the day to prevent usage during class.\nThe students carry the pouches, designed by the company Yondr, during the entire school day, with their phones inside but not accessible. At the conclusion of school, a magnetic, unlocking device lets the students unlock the pouches and retrieve their phones.\nCaroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said middle school was the right level to implement the test of the technology.\n\"Middle school students are wrestling with a lot of things, a lot of changes,\" Simmons said. \"There's a lot going on for kids at that time, a lot of research is talking about the impact of devices on kids at that age in particular.\"\nAs Caroline County pilots the Yondr pouches, Talbot and Dorchester counties are preparing for implementation later this fall. Across the board, there is a common goal of improving in areas such as student achievement, attendance and discipline.\nSimmons said his district attempted to take a strict stance on cell phone usage after the pandemic. However, teachers and administrators found it hard to enforce the policies in large classrooms and settings.\n\"The devil was in the details of implementation,\" Simmons said. \"Saying it and getting folks to be able to monitor was really hard. … Being able to keep an eye on every kid who's (looking at a phone) … it's impossible.\"\nThe pouches cost about $30 each. Simmons said Yondr believes the pouches will last three to four years.\nDorchester County Public Schools will be implementing a similar pilot later this school year. Valerie Goff, DCPS communication and community outreach specialist, said the district is hoping to begin its pilot before the end of October for middle school students only.\nTalbot County Public Schools may follow suit soon thereafter. At an Aug. 26 Moms for Liberty meeting with school administration, TCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the district hopes to roll out the same Yondr pouches after Thanksgiving.\nPepukayi and Easton Middle School math teacher Robert Jurrius responded to questions about access to cell phones in the event of a school emergency.\n\"I need you to pay attention when something bad is happening,\" Jurrius said on Aug 26. \"And there is no circumstance where a child looking at their phone at that moment is going to be safer. Parents might feel better that they can reach their child, but they're actually endangering their child.\"\n\"What I've heard from the emergency response and the crisis management people,\" Pepukayi said, \"is they want students to be able to listen to the directions of where they need to go and what they need to do versus being distracted in looking at their phone.\"\nSimmons said the same regarding the situation of a school emergency while kids' phones are locked in pouches. \"If there's an absolute emergency, we need the kids to focus in on their teacher,\" he said.\nIn Caroline County Public Schools, Simmons said the district will track if there's a decrease in student discipline or increases in student focus and achievement. If results are positive, the policy could extend to other schools in the district.\nWhile the superintendent did say the high school level \"presents an interesting dilemma\" and a need for balance as students are being prepared for adulthood, it's the next step if Caroline County's pilot yields improvements.\n\"If we do see positive impacts in the middle, it absolutely warrants that we look at it at our high schools in some settings,\" Simmons said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some organizations in attendance were Minary's Dream Alliance, the Easterseals and Open Doors Partners in Education.\nArnold's two hour musical set was interrupted briefly by Foster and President of Washington College Mike Sosulski.\nFoster informed people who weren't familiar with the town, of Hebe, the wine-bearer to the gods. She was recently honored on Aug. 15, the 125th anniversary of her installation, Foster said.\nFrom mythology to history, he pointed out in 1790, Chestertown was the first town to take a census, noting the area was considered to be the center of the country at one time.\nSosulski congratulated all his students. Because of the freshman, he proclaimed, this year had the largest incoming class, at 293. The school is not only breaking enrollment records. He said the electric boat team already broke the Guinness World Record for the distance a battery-operated boat travels. The former record holders were from England in 2001. Sosulski said the college beat them by six hours.\n\"And the semester just started. Who knows what's next?\", he relayed to the audience.\nHe welcomed his students of course, but also the public in general to all the things the college has to offer.\nThe college is making significant strides to ensure every student or visitor to the college is comfortable no matter what views he or she may hold, he said in an interview following his public remarks, and are in the preliminary stages of stating that formally, with input from students, staff and faculty.\n\"It's important we stand up for Washington's principles of free expression,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's meant to encourage improvisers to listen to their partners and appreciate their ideas.\n\"I hear what you're saying, I'm going to honor it, and I'm going to grow from it,\" Hillyard says.\nAs a Spanish and English as a second language math teacher at Easton High School, Hillyard embraces the \"Yes, and\" philosophy with his students. It's a core message he has delivered to teachers across Talbot County and the state since he was named Talbot County Public Schools' 2024-25 Teacher of the Year in April.\n\"That philosophy has really carried over with me into the classroom,\" Hillyard said. \"Having my students know that I have a genuine interest in them as human beings and that I will do what I need to do to support them.\"\nOn Wednesday, Hillyard was named one of seven finalists for Maryland Teacher of the Year by the state's Board of Education. A selection panel nailed down finalists from 24 district teachers of the year through a rigorous application and evaluation process.\nHillyard was shocked when he heard the news of his selection as a finalist from colleagues who texted him congratulations.\n\"I'm like, 'What are they talking about?'\" he recalled. \"I checked my email and it said I was a state finalist, and I was like, 'Holy cow, I'm a state finalist?'\"\nHillyard and the other finalists will attend a reception in Baltimore on Oct. 4 where the Maryland Teacher of the Year will be announced.\n\"It's very, very humbling, and I'm very grateful to know that my efforts to go above and beyond are being recognized,\" Hillyard said.\nSTEPPING UPHillyard has taught at Easton High School since 2010. His original background is in the foreign language department. Last year, the school was in need of a teacher for its English for speakers of other languages, or ESOL, math course.\nHaving a certification to teach math, he stepped in and took on the workload without any hesitation.\n\"To me, the best teacher is when they see an educational need that they can help with, they do it,\" Hillyard said. \"They jump in there and do it.\"\nBy using his skill sets in math and Spanish, he's been able to embrace the challenge of teaching children at a wide variety of progress levels in their English abilities. Depending on their backgrounds, some may come in on track in math, but unable to complete operations in English.\nHillyard lays the groundwork by starting with basic math in English and then moving to more advanced arithmetic as the full-year course continues.\n\"They each come with a set of their own challenges and strengths and weaknesses,\" Hillyard said. \"That kind of challenge pushes me to want to figure out a way to overcome those or address those.\"\nLOOKING AHEADHillyard and the other 23 district teachers recognized this cycle will have opportunities to explore the state and collaborate throughout the upcoming months. Hillyard's excited for that journey, which includes stops at Deep Creek Lake in Garrett County and the statehouse in Annapolis.\nWith the school year beginning, he said he's also excited to advance initiatives with colleagues at Easton High.\nRecently, the morning announcements have been presented in both English and Spanish, with the help of Hillyard's Advanced Placement Spanish class. He's hoping small improvements will make the growing number of Spanish-speaking students feel more welcomed at Easton High.\n\"I'm very excited in my school to be working with some colleagues at making our entire school a more equitable environment for our Spanish-speaking community or multilingual community,\" Hillyard said.\nNo matter the background of a student, the district teacher of the year aims to play a supporting role in the student's academic journey.\n\"The students, at the end of the day, they're the authors,\" Hillyard says.\n\"That positive relationship and them knowing that my classroom is a safe, supportive place and they can learn and be themselves without being judged or criticized, is truly the secret ingredient.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "For Dorchester superintendent, it's all about teaching and learning\n\n September 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 746\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — When Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson stepped into a third grade classroom at Sandy Hill Elementary during one of the first weeks of the school year, he saw sheer energy.\"They might have been doing a social emotional learning lesson,\" Thompson recalled. \"And the kids were so involved. They were standing up in their chairs. And the teacher was so energetic.\"\nEveryone was engaged. And for the student that didn't want to get involved, the teacher had him help her with the lesson on the computer so that he was still participating.\nNeither the third grade teacher nor the school's principal knew Thompson would be stopping by Sandy Hill Elementary that day.\n\"And so you know it wasn't a dog and pony show,\" he said.\nFor Thompson, who visits the school system's buildings and classrooms every week, the reason for these visits isn't to catch principals and teachers doing the wrong thing. It's to create a comfortable atmosphere of teaching and learning and to offer guidance when needed.\n\"I used to be a principal, I used to be assistant principal and teacher,\" Thompson said. \"So I want to make sure that they are comfortable with me and know I'm here to help better them and get them supports to be better.\"\nSince becoming superintendent in June, Thompson has made known his hope of bringing the district's ranking up from 23rd to 15th in the state. In an effort to do this in four years, the district has identified different steps to making that happen.\nThis year, the district is focusing on instructional leadership, taking a top-down approach in an effort to improve student success. Thompson considers instructional leadership — or leadership that focuses on teaching and learning — as his top priority this school year.\n\"Outside of the teacher, administration has the most impact on student achievement, without a doubt,\" he said, adding that because principals oversee the entire school, and not just one classroom, they have the most impact on student achievement.\nJodi Colman, assistant superintendent of academics and student services, said that Dorchester County is usually toward the bottom when it comes to rankings among the other school districts in the state.\n\"And at this point in time, the only way we're going to change that rating and our students are going to start performing at higher academic levels is (if we) focus on instructional leadership within the school system,\" she said.\nIn March, the Dorchester County Board of Education approved a purchasing agreement to bring coaching and professional development support for district administrators.\nThompson, the then-interim superintendent, said at the March 25 board meeting that the district executive team expects all its principals to become \"great instructional leaders,\" but not enough professional development has been provided to those leaders.\nOn Sept. 16, Thompson said this professional development support includes leadership meetings twice per month that focus on how administrators should give feedback to teachers on how to improve in the classroom.\n\"Making sure that (administrators are) continually developing (teachers') skills to deliver the best instruction to the kids,\" he said.\nIn order to jump from 23rd in the state to 15th in four years, Thompson said the district will need to be consistent with developing instructional leadership and follow through on it.\n\"Making sure that I'm having meetings with the principals, having conversations on how they're progressing on their goals,\" he said. \"And if they're not progressing, how can we shift and go in a little different direction to ensure that they're meeting their goals?\"\nThompson thinks one of the biggest challenges the district faces this year will be getting people comfortable with change and holding them accountable to those changes. He said that often, people automatically think accountability is negative, but when you don't hold people accountable, you end up doing them a disservice.\n\"We don't want to fire anybody,\" he said. \"We want people to do what they were hired to do. And we want to be able to provide the supports when people are struggling at their craft, and then help them improve their craft. When we talk about accountability, that's what we mean.\"\nColman said that change can be uncomfortable. She said she hopes that by the end of the year, people in the district will find a comfort in being uncomfortable.\n\"We're only going to make this move if we all know that we've got the same target and (know) that we're all going to have to push ourselves to probably go and do things that we're not normally used to doing,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The two actors captivated the audience with a conversation between these historic figures and the attendees, offering a unique perspective on liberty, freedom and the Constitution.\nSmith highlighted the importance of reading and learning history as a \"manual for mankind to be better.\" With humor and deep knowledge of Jefferson's life, he stressed that \"when you allow destruction of your neighbor's rights you allow destruction of your own.\"\nWallace detailed the flaws within the early years of America, pointing to how slavery oppressed millions of human lives for generations despite the country's claim to be a land of freedom. He emphasized the importance of remembering the injustices of the past to improve the future.\nThe free event drew a large crowd, eager to celebrate and reflect on the significance of the U.S. Constitution. State Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) delivered a welcome address, setting the stage for the day's festivities, which also included the Sons of the American Revolution in period costumes, a color guard and a town crier who announced the signing of the Constitution. Students from Saints Peter and Paul High School and North Dorchester High School were in attendance.\nThe event also honored new U.S. citizens in Talbot County, recognizing their achievement in earning citizenship credentials. Attendees enjoyed free Constitution giveaways and sweet treats afterward.\nAlthough the event was well-attended, organizer Julie Quick said that the Constitution Allegiance aims to reach even more schools and individuals in the future. She said, \"the Constitution is so important for everybody,\" adding that it goes beyond being a political document. She said it serves as \"the foundation of who we are,\" encouraging individuals to \"think beyond ourselves.\"\nIn addition to the public celebration, the Constitution Alliance is committed to engaging local youth. On the following day, students from St. Michaels Middle High School participated in a special event where they watched a reenactment and interacted directly with the actors, fostering a deeper understanding of the nation's founding principles.\nThe event was hosted by the Constitution Alliance; The Institute for Religion, Politics and Culture at Washington College; and Operation Frederick Douglass on the Hill and was supported through local sponsors.\nBeyond this event, the Constitution Alliance remains focused on increasing Constitutional literacy among students of all ages. Through educational programming and its annual $1,000 higher education scholarships, the alliance seeks to inspire a new generation of citizens committed to upholding constitutional values. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Program participants engage in cutting-edge research and expand their professional networks, often continuing research collaborations started abroad and laying the groundwork for forging future partnerships between institutions.\nCoutts will find out which country she will be traveling to later this school year. Once abroad, she will participate in research that will be published in a publication on global education.\n\"I'm very excited,\" Coutts said at Wednesday's meeting. \"There's been 80 teachers from the U.S. who were chosen for this. There's 23 elementary teachers. For the next 10 weeks, I will be participating in an online course.\"\nUpon returning from their abroad trips, Fulbright recipients share their stories and often become active supporters of international exchange, inviting foreign scholars to campus and encouraging colleagues and students to go abroad.\nAs Fulbright alumni, their careers are enriched by joining a network of thousands of esteemed scholars, many of whom are leaders in their fields. Notable Fulbright alumni include 62 Nobel Prize laureates, 89 Pulitzer Prize recipients, 78 MacArthur Fellows and 41 who have served as a head of state or government.\nSince 1946, the Fulbright Program has provided more than 400,000 participants from over 160 countries — chosen for their academic merit and leadership potential — with the opportunity to exchange ideas and contribute to finding solutions to challenges facing different communities.\nThe Fulbright Program is the U.S. government's flagship international educational exchange program.

In math, the district rose 1% to 12.3% proficiency, ranking 21st in the state.\nDuring the meetingThursday, Jodi Colman, the district's assistant superintendent of academics and student services, showed proficiency rates and rankings in the state broken down by grade level.\nColman said there were eight grade levels where the district's state ranking in math increased and six grade levels where the district's state ranking in English increased.\nIn fifth grade science, where 14.4% of students were considered proficient on the 2024 MCAP assessment, the ranking went up to 20th in the state for 2024 compared to 22nd the previous year.\nColman said that at a statewide assistant superintendent meeting recently, Dorchester County was mentioned for its growth in third grade math, sixth grade math and middle school algebra.\n\"I thought that was nice to be highlighted across the state as seeing a district that is actually moving some of their scores,\" she said after mentioning that math scores across the state were pretty stagnant in the 2024 MCAP compared to the previous year.\nColman also brought up concerns regarding district MCAP scores.\nAccording to the data Colman shared, 30.6% of 10th graders scored proficient on the English assessment last school year, ranking last in the state.\nColman said the district is looking at its support pathway classes, which it hopes will affect the 10th grade data \"more significantly.\"\nColman also brought up elementary English scores. She said that as students go up in grade, English proficiency levels decrease.\nColman said there have been discussions about whether the district should resume using its instructional program for elementary English or adopt a new one. The district's language arts supervisor is researching this.\nMoving forward, the district is getting feedback from the state on a new comprehensive literacy plan, Colman said.\n\"We are also looking at, across the board, our tier one instruction for any content level,\" she said. \"Making sure that we're really using that instructional planning model, that we're thinking through strategically with our students and that do we have good, formative assessment data to use in order to change teaching within our classrooms. And I think we have a lot of work to do in that area.\"\nColman said that although the MCAP scores aren't \"exactly where we want them,\" there is hope in the county about increasing the scores going forward.\n\"So I'm excited about that,\" she said.\nAfter Colman's presentation, Superintendent Jymil Thompson said although the score increases might not be \"monumental,\" they show progress.\n\"If we continue that progress over the years, it will add up,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said the purpose of the plan is to guide the work of the district from 2025 through 2028.\n\"This is kind of a long run for a strategic planning process,\" she said. \"So we want to be really inclusive. We want to be very engaging and come up with something that feels just a little bit scary but very doable for DCPS.\"\nCasson said the questions they want to answer in developing this plan include how to best prepare students, how to recruit and retain the best teachers and staff, how to provide students with opportunities to explore careers in local industries, and how to do best with the resources available.\nTo create the plan, Casson said September and October will be spent reviewing district data and understanding where the district is right now.\n\"This will include student surveys, parent surveys and staff surveys,\" she said.\nIn the coming months, through June, time will be spent researching and exploring what other districts are doing, prioritizing strengths and new initiatives, making plans and turning those plans into budgets, communicating district priorities to local partners, and starting to plan for next school year and beyond.\nCasson said Integrated Impact Group will give monthly updates to the board. She said they have set up an email account, planning@dcpsmd.org, that people can reach out to.\nThe district and Integrated Impact Group will be holding three community meetings for residents to share their ideas and priorities for the school years ahead. These meetings will be held Oct. 14 at Hurlock United Methodist Church, Oct. 15 at St. Luke Methodist Church and Oct. 16 at South Dorchester School.

Team members shared their inspiring story, detailing the design failures they overcame in the process of building their electric boats, which eventually led to the team's success, winning first place in multiple races against other teams from universities with large engineering programs.Electric Boat Team President Douglas Hewes, a member of RCS' Class of 2018, spoke, along with WC students Mac Sansbury, Tiyaba Jamil, and Team Advisor Brian Palmer, about the strategies they used to design their boats each year and remain competitive against teams like Princeton University.\nBy thoughtfully building better batteries, stronger electric motors, more efficient solar technology, and hydrodynamic hull designs, they were able to start bringing home top place awards. Palmer noted, \"Our students are taking away technical insights that are valuable of course, but perhaps more important is the practice they are getting at recognizing problems to solve, learning how to design solutions, and not getting dissuaded when things don't always turn out as they hoped. It's a great opportunity for them to build technical capabilities as well as perseverance and grit that is needed to see complex projects through to fruition.\"\nPalmer excitedly shared the news about the team's most recent success–breaking the Guinness World Record for the greatest distance by an electric boat on a single charge without solar Sept. 2. WC team broke the previous world record by 21 miles. Hewes remarked, \"When we were building the trimaran, we didn't even think about beating a world record or even thought we could…Then, we did the calculations and then we realized, hey, we might actually be able to beat the record.\"\nThe students had the opportunity to watch video footage of the record-breaking success and see the winning boat in person, as well as to ask questions about the boat's design and the team's plans for the future. \"We are grateful to the Washington College Electric Boat Team for sharing their story about how they overcame failure to find success. It's important for our students to hear that it's okay to try hard and come up short; in all good design thinking, failure is just part of the learning process. It was apparent from the number of hands in the air and the thoughtful student questions that this remarkable story had a real impact on our young learners,\" said Head of School Peter Thayer.\nTo learn more about the Electric Boat Team at Washington College, visit WACElectricBoat.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Angela Laaro said. \"Next year we are hoping to host public sails more regularly, hopefully once or twice a month. … We also like to have the ship dockside for museum guests to explore.\"\nEarlier this summer, Laaro was passed command of the Dove by former Capt. Will Gates. Gates had been acting as the reproduction 17th century trading ship's keeper since 1989.\nA St. Mary's native, Laaro began her time with the museum at the age of 14. Initially acting as a volunteer at the museum's tobacco plantation exhibit, she eventually moved to the Dove and said she fell in love with the ship. Later on she traveled to Maine and beyond to gain experience on historical schooners and windjammers.\nOver a span of 10 years, she manned several boats before returning to St. Mary's to take over for Gates.\n\"Having grown up in Maryland, working on the Dove helps me feel connected to my own history,\" she said. \" I love the camaraderie of the crew and being able to help keep history alive.\"\nKaren Adler of Bushwood was a passenger on Sept. 21 along with her daughter, Casey Adler.\n\"I'm interested in local history and I've lived here in St. Mary's for 27 years,\" Karen Adler said. \"I recently learned of the new Dove and was really excited to learn they were letting the public sail.\"\nMichael Bellis, director of advancement of communication at Historic St. Mary's City, said the ship and the museum onsite are special because of their authentic storytelling and way of reconciling the past.\n\"We are on the cutting edge of museum best practices,\" he said, adding the sailing trips are meant to be an educational tool. \"We give passengers a really tactile experience of sailing in the seventeenth century. … The crew will typically be dressed in traditional garb reflecting the time period.\"\nAccording to Chief Mate Jeremy Heveron, it takes a lot of hands to run a tall ship like the Dove. At least seven crew members are required on deck by the U.S. Coast Guard to take it out on the water.\nStaff aboard the Dove share the history of the ship throughout the ride and encourage guests to interact with the vessel.\nBeginning next spring, public sails on the Dove can be reserved online. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The average annual cost of infant care in Maryland is $15,335 — that's $1,278 per month. Maryland is ranked seventh out of the 50 states for most expensive infant care.\nAs a single mother living in Talbot County (a known child care desert) who is responsible for paying my mortgage, $80,000 in college loan debt and putting food on the table for my son, I worry every single day how I am going to make it financially to pay for child care until he reaches age 5 and can enter the public school system.\nDuring this election season, we hear candidates talk about putting families first, but we need real policy solutions that ensure that families like mine aren't forced to drown in debt.\nThis shouldn't be a partisan issue: 89% of voters want candidates to have a plan to help working parents afford high-quality childcare, underscoring the broad, bipartisan support for addressing the child care crisis.\nI urge Angela Alsobrooks, Larry Hogan, Blane Miller and Andy Harris to commit to prioritizing child care in their first 100 days if elected.\nIt's time for our leaders to answer moms across the country who are calling for affordable, accessible, and quality child care.

    "content": "Washington College Electric Boat Team visits Radcliffe Creek School\n\n October 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Local News \n \n 413\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Radcliffe Creek School students were treated to a special presentation by the Washington College Electric Boat Team Sept. 20. Team members shared their inspiring story, detailing the design failures they overcame in the process of building their electric boats, which eventually led to the team's success, winning first place in multiple races against other teams from universities with large engineering programs.Electric Boat Team President Douglas Hewes, a member of Radcliffe's Class of 2018, spoke, along with Washington College students Mac Sansbury, Tiyaba Jamil, and team adviser Brian Palmer, about the strategies they used to design their boats each year and remain competitive against teams like Princeton University.\nBy thoughtfully building better batteries, stronger electric motors, more efficient solar technology, and hydrodynamic hull designs, they were able to start bringing home top place awards. Palmer noted, \"Our students are taking away technical insights that are valuable of course, but perhaps more important is the practice they are getting at recognizing problems to solve, learning how to design solutions, and not getting dissuaded when things don't always turn out as they hoped. It's a great opportunity for them to build technical capabilities as well as perseverance and grit that is needed to see complex projects through to fruition.\"\nPalmer excitedly shared the news about the team's most recent success — breaking the Guinness World Record for the greatest distance by an electric boat on a single charge without solar Sept. 2. The Washington team broke the previous world record by 21 miles.\nHewes remarked, \"When we were building the trimaran, we didn't even think about beating a world record or even thought we could. … Then, we did the calculations and then we realized, hey, we might actually be able to beat the record.\"\nThe students had the opportunity to watch video footage of the record-breaking success and see the winning boat in person, as well as to ask questions about the boat's design and the team's plans for the future.\n\"We are grateful to the Washington College Electric Boat Team for sharing their story about how they overcame failure to find success. It's important for our students to hear that it's OK to try hard and come up short; in all good design thinking, failure is just part of the learning process. It was apparent from the number of hands in the air and the thoughtful student questions that this remarkable story had a real impact on our young learners,\" Head of School Peter Thayer said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Four years after her murder, Madison Sparrow's legacy lives on\n\n October 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 735\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n From a young age, Madison Sparrow always wanted to be a teacher.\"She definitely knew what she wanted to be and never swayed,\" her mother, Heather Sparrow Murphy, said. \"And kids loved her. She was a tutor and a babysitter and she helped me run my Girl Scout troop for her younger sister.\"\nMadison never got the chance to realize her dream of following in the footsteps of several family members and becoming a teacher. The 17-year-old Newark Charter School junior was murdered by her ex-boyfriend and another friend in Delaware four years ago this month.\nHer dream lives on, however, through five Newark Charter students who have received scholarships in Madison's name to pursue a career in education.\n\"I call them my girls,\" Murphy said, describing the close bond she has with the scholarship recipients. \"They're like my kids. They all keep in contact with me.\"\nThe first recipient, Kristen White, is nearly done with her degree and recently started her student-teaching assignment.\n\"She said to me, 'Miss Heather, as hard as it is...I remember I'm doing this for Madison,'\" Murphy said. \"And that gets me.\"\nMurphy raises money for the scholarship through the annual Love Wins 5K. Now in its fourth year, the race drew more than 200 people to Glasgow Park on Saturday.\n\"I definitely cry every year,\" Murphy said. \"It's really emotional, but it also means so much to me and helps me continue to go on and keep her memory alive. You can't even put words on that. I mean, that's what I live for.\"\nThe Madison Sparrow Scholarship is awarded each year to a Newark Charter senior pursuing a career in education, and the recipients can reapply for funding each year. Last year, Murphy was able to give a scholarship to two deserving seniors.\nMadison was killed Oct. 2, 2020, after her supposed friend Annika Stalczynski lured her into the woods behind Maclary Elementary School, where Madison's ex-boyfriend Noah Sharp fatally struck her with a baseball bat. They then dumped her body near Interstate 95.\nBoth Sharp and Stalczynski were convicted of first-degree murder in 2022 and are serving lengthy prison sentences.\nMurphy is involved with the nonprofit Victims' Voices Heard and recently participated in the organization's victim-offender dialog program, which allowed her to sit down with Stalczynski and talk about the murder and how losing her daughter affected her.\n\"It was a beautiful experience,\" Murphy said. \"I'm sure it's not for every victim, but as Madison's mom, because I knew these children so well, it was something that I needed from the beginning.\"\nBoth Murphy and Stalczynski spent five months meeting separately with a mediator and then spent four hours speaking with each other. As hard as it was to face her daughter's murderer, Murphy felt she had to get answers from Stalczynski.\n\"She was with my daughter when she was murdered, so there's only that truth, there's only those answers,\" Murphy said. \"And she was very honest with me. Because I was here when Madison was brought into the world, I needed to know how Madison left it, and she was able to give me all the answers.\"\nThe meeting helped Murphy process her grief.\n\"I'll never have closure, but it definitely closed the chapter on the things I needed to know,\" she said. \"I said everything I needed to say and I received everything I needed to learn.\"\nMurphy already forgave Sharp and Stalczynski — both of whom she knew well before Madison's murder — during her victim impact statement during their sentencing.\n\"Forgiveness is something, I truly believe, that we do for ourselves not something that I do for the people that murdered my daughter,\" she said. \"It's also just the way that Madison lived her life, and that's the whole message of 'love wins.'\"\nMurphy continues to hear stories about Madison when she sees her daughter's friends and former teachers.\n\"The community outpouring and love just shows me how much people love my daughter and how much she impacted our community,\" she said. \"It continues every year with this race, and it's a beautiful way for me to see that and be surrounded and for us all to be together.\"\nMadison, Murphy said, \"was an amazing soul.\"\n\"She just loved children, and they loved her back,\" she said. \"She was a gentle soul, she loved her friends, she was so loyal to everyone, just an amazing daughter.\"\nTo donate to the Madison Sparrow Scholarship Fund, visit runsignup.com/Race/DE/Newark/LoveWins5KDE. Murphy is also looking for sponsors for next year's race. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It requires students to place their phones in locked pouches. The pouches stay with the students but remain locked until the end of the school day.\n\"Today's youth battle constant distraction caused by cell phone alerts and messaging that interrupt their ability to focus,\" Supt. Derek L. Simmons said in a recent notice to students and parents. He said this \"creates a negative impact on school culture and learning.\"\nElsewhere, administrators are getting creative about persuading students to go along with the plan.\nIn St. Mary's County, Supt. Scott Smith recently released a video describing the district's new plan to limit the distractions caused by cell phones.\nIn the video, he comically stops midway through his presentation of the new rules to take out his phone and text, showing students how difficult it can be to have a conversation when they are disengaged and on their phones.\n\"Hold on, just wait a second, I'm just going to text him real fast,\" Smith said in the video, pretending to send a message.\n\"That's really rude isn't it?\" he then pointed out. \"We're supposed to be having a conversation, and I'm interrupting myself and I'm getting on my phone and I'm texting.\"\n\"I'm not really here right?\" Smith said. \"I'm kind of distracted.\"\nSince the start of the school year, in St. Mary's County, they have confiscated around 30 cell phones per day, Smith told the school board in a recent meeting. That's out of 10,000 students, he said at the meeting.\n\"We have had many conversations about the joy of being in a classroom without the distraction of cell phones,\" Smith said, adding that he and his staff \"continue to work with our secondary students about the joy and some of the challenges of cellular devices and how we can maximize our joy and fun in life.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Incumbent Candace Henry and Ann O'Connor are squaring off for the District 2 seat. In District 5, incumbent Anna Howie and Karla Wieland-Cherry are running.\nThe District 6 seat, currently held by Mary Wheeler, is a race between Kerry Gunshenan and Cynthia Jurrius.\nHenry, O'Connor, Howie and Jurrius attended Wednesday's town hall, answering moderator and audience questions. Wieland-Cherry and Gunshenan did not attend.\nTEST SCORESScores released in August showed slight improvements in math and English proficiency rates in the district. The four candidates, though, were adamant that test scores must improve.\nIn English, 47.3% of Talbot County Public Schools students tested proficient, a jump of 2.8% from 44.5% in 2022-2023. In math, 18.3% of students were proficient, up 1.1% from 17.2% the year prior. The district slots in 14th and 18th, respectively, in those categories among the state's 24 districts.\n\"Our scores are not what we want,\" Henry said. She added that an increase in math coaches in the elementary schools and other forms of benchmark testing are current district initiatives.\n\"Standardized testing is a snapshot in a period of time,\" Henry said. \"(Superintendent Sharon) Pepukayi has worked with her team to really be intentional about gathering data from students on a more consistent basis.\"\nIn recent months, county residents have received flyers in the mail questioning the test scores, along with district spending and, most recently, a health education framework bill proposed at the state level.\n\"These flyers that came out are pretty alarming,\" O'Connor said. \"And I don't look at them as a negative on teachers. Teachers don't want these scores. The system is broken.\"\nO'Connor, who is backed by Talbot County's chapter of Moms for Liberty, a nationwide conservative political organization, said a lack of \"meaningful homework\" is a \"deficiency.\" She advocated for summer reading and said the district should look at what nearby private schools are doing in order to raise TCPS test scores.\nJurrius, who along with Henry and Howie is endorsed by the Talbot County Education Association labor union, addressed the most recent mailer sent to residents. That mailer stated, in part, that \"radical politicians are more worried about forcing harmful gender ideology\" on students, referencing a state Senate bill from 2023 that did not pass.\nJurrius stated she does not believe educators are indoctrinating students.\n\"This destructive polarization isn't helpful,\" Jurrius said. \"And whoever is behind it, (I) would love to see them contribute in a positive way. I think if we all work together, we can do some amazing things to increase our schools' test scores.\"\nSTUDENT ENGAGEMENTAcross the state, many districts are exploring ways to reduce cell phone use and other distractions in schools. TCPS has plans to roll out a pilot program for cell phone pouches sometime after Thanksgiving.\nHowie, an assistant principal at Federalsburg Elementary School in Caroline County, said Caroline County's current pilot of those same cell phone pouches has been a success.\n\"You can see engagement going through the roof,\" Howie said.\nShe emphasized that technology should be an addition to student learning and not the sole focus. \"A computer isn't a replacement, right. A computer should be a tool,\" she said.\nO'Connor said the same of computers. She said cell phones do not belong in schools and added she hopes to see an increased focus on books.\n\"Going back to the basics,\" O'Connor said. \"Are we reading books? Are books coming home? … I don't see them as much.\"\nJurrius advocated for \"restorative practices\" in student discipline to hold students accountable for actions. She said suspensions aren't always the solution.\n\"Students right now are different,\" Jurrius said. \"They have different challenges in their lives, their social media, their mental health issues.\"\nTEACHER RETENTIONCandidates discussed the need for effective recruitment and retention of teachers and staff amid shortages in the district, along with strategies to rectify those shortcomings.\nHowie emphasized the importance of retaining teachers and staff. She said looking at intent forms earlier will help the district and board understand why teachers leave.\n\"Being very intentional in having those conversations early … instead of getting that intent form at the end of the year and just start tallying up,\" Howie said.\nHenry added that the district should especially consider the feedback from teachers and staff that decide to stay. She hopes to see specific attention dedicated toward the district's \"Grow Your Own Teachers\" scholarship program.\n\"We should be growing teachers from our communities that can come back and teach in our communities,\" Henry said.\nResidents in Districts 2, 5 and 6 will see the respective school board candidates on the ballot on Election Day, which is Nov. 5. The three candidates elected will serve four-year terms. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Understanding Latinidad: Educator speaks to Chesapeake College students\n\n October 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 639\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS — Dozens of students, faculty and community members gathered at the Wye Mills Humanities Cadby Theatre and enjoyed jamaica (hibiscus) agua fresca, fresh fruit, piles of spicy chips and an encouraging message of embracing their native cultures.In celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, Chesapeake College's Hispanic/Latino Student Union hosted advocate, educator and teacher Samantha Martinez to speak on what her Latinidad means to her.\nLindsay Velasquez, president of the Hispanic/Latino Student Union, said she was excited to bring Martinez as a speaker and loved the encouragement she shared with students in attendance to feel empowered by their cultural identity.\n\"I just feel like all of us feel like we can do it, and that little doubt that we had of not being able to do something, like, we can do it,\" Velasquez said. \"And she's an example of anything that is possible if you put your mind to it.\"\nLatinidad is a particular experience that contains the complexities of immigration, race, color, class and language. Martinez said her story stems from an immigration story.\n\"I'm really proud of that because of (my parents') struggle, and their survival and their grit, I'm able to stand here in front of you today,\" she said.\nHer mother migrated from Mexico and her father from El Salvador. She grew up in Chicago, which she describes as \"a city that really appreciated and celebrated what it means to be Latina,\" though the city was heavily segregated.\nAfter meeting her husband and getting married, she moved to New York and became a teacher in the South Bronx, known as the poorest school district in the country. There, Martinez learned of excellence.\nShe said she was expected to perform at a level of excellence that she had never been asked to before, and in turn she learned to expect it from the people and students around her.\nShe said the South Bronx \"will forever be a part of my story and my legacy.\"\nAfter spending her time in the South Bronx, Martinez moved to Talbot County. It was a culture shock, but to her surprise, she found a growing Latino population. Her new home also forced her to affirm and challenge her own identity as a Latina.\nMartinez worked for Talbot County Public Schools and then founded Mid-Shore Scholars, a college prep program that serves first-generation college students.\nWhen leading the program, she decided it was time to focus on the marginalized student population. The program was meant to target a population of students who had the potential to go to Ivy Leagues, but she pushed for a different perspective. Martinez said it was important to focus on the students who lacked the resources to get to college.\n\"It's these students who don't have any help at home, who don't have any representation, whose parents want to give them the best life but didn't go to college here, who don't know the ropes or don't know how to navigate the system,\" Martinez said.\nDuring the pandemic, she decided to focus on building an institution to better assist marginalized communities and helped create the Polaris Village Academy. Martinez said the academy centers joy, celebrating culture and empowering students and families, making them feel safe and seen.\nMartinez ended her presentation with photos of her family visiting their native countries and the importance that focusing on her roots allowed her the opportunity to help those around her to grow.\n\"My superpower is that I am bicultural, that I have roots in (El Salvador) and in Mexico, and I have roots here, and that I can be both from there and from here, and then it's not 'and/or.' I could bring my whole self,\" Martinez said. \"And I encourage all the students here who are questioning their identity or wondering if they can be authentically themselves when they go to class or when they step into white institutions that yes, you can.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I want to clarify that this is not true. I have not received endorsements from Mom's For Liberty or any other group.I have attended meetings hosted by the local M4L Chapter to better understand their perspectives and issues. This is one of my guiding principles — to attend meetings in the community to gather information so I can make my own decisions. At the last meeting, our superintendent, assistant superintendents and director of communications for TCPS were present as guest speakers, highlighting the ongoing dialogue between our school system and the community.\nPeople may incorrectly label me according to their perspectives, based on where I go, what groups I frequent, and in what activities I'm involved, but my focus remains clear: I am committed to the children of this county, our dedicated teachers and the importance of parental involvement. Collaboration among the three groups is essential to elevate our schools; it's a three legged stool — if one leg falters, the entire system is compromised.\nIf elected to the school board, I will prioritize listening to all voices to make informed decisions. My platform is based on the ABC's of education: Advancing Academics, Boosting Accountability and Cultivating Character. These principles will guide my decision making and efforts to improve our schools.\nTogether, let's strive for excellence and overcome mediocrity in our educational system. It would be an honor and privilege to serve as your school board member.\nANN O'CONNOR\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The conservative candidates are: Ann O'Connor (District 2), Karla Wieland-Cherry (District 5), and Kerry Gunshenan (District 6). The progressive candidates are: Cynthia Jurrius ( District 6), Anna Howie (District 5) and Candace Henry (District 2).\nAs a public service, the local chapter of a parent support group called Moms for Liberty hosted a debate for the school board candidates on Sept. 23 at the Easton firehouse. All six candidates were invited; four appeared, including Cynthia Jurrius and the three conservatives Ann O'Connor, Karla Wieland-Cherry and Kerry Gunshenan. The event was a success and helpful for parents and grandparents in deciding for whom they will vote to sit on the local school board. Another school board candidates' debate was held on Wednesday, Oct. 2, at 6 p.m. at the Avalon Theater and all six candidates were invited to speak.\nWhile Moms for Liberty, according to several public statements made by the chapter Chair Jan Greenhawk, does not endorse any of the candidates, the Moms have been accused in a local periodical of \"inserting their partisan candidates into a non-partisan position.\" Such an accusation is surprising in light of the fact that another school board candidates' debate was held at the Academy Art Museum, sponsored by the Talbot County Democratic Forum.\nSadly, only three of the candidates were invited to speak. And guess which three. Yes, the three more progressive candidates, who happen to be Democrats. The other three candidates, the three conservative candidates, were not invited at all. And yet Moms for Liberty, which has not endorsed a single candidate, is accused of partisanship? Why are liberals so afraid to hear the opinions of conservatives, especially as regards our children's education? Is it that conservatives put children's well-being ahead of the latest fads of social-engineering and psychological manipulation? Is it because conservatives want to truly educate the children rather than indoctrinating them with left-wing philosophies?\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She volunteers with many local organizations. Wieland-Cherry said she grew up in a home that kept up with and often interacted with politics, both local and national. She is married and has two children.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI am running for the Talbot County Board of Education to work to improve our local school system for students, parents and our community.\nGoals I hope to achieve will be to improve test scores by enticing more qualified teachers to teach in Talbot County and retaining current teachers; raising education benchmark standards; increase use of CTE programs; improve student discipline rules; improve school safety measures; improve open communication transparency between schools, teachers, administration and parents and the community.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nAfter speaking with teachers in different grades at local schools, the constant concern I hear is the lack of student discipline and their safety as teachers. Teachers can't teach and students can't learn… and test scores can't improve… and teachers won't want to come teach in a county… if they are in an environment where everyone feels unsafe.\nTeachers have a distrust of the current board and feel that they don't listen to them and take their concerns seriously. I want to rebuild that trust by listening to teacher concerns and addressing those in a more supportive manner to make necessary changes.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nLack of teachers and staff seems to be the biggest issue. As I mentioned already in the prior questions, my priority will be to listen to teachers and rebuild the trust that is currently missing with the present board.\nI will also work to improve communication between schools, teachers, parents and the community and work to create a more secure learning environment for everyone.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nEveryone should take their own initiative to investigate local school data from reliable resources. These postcards are one way of bringing awareness to the community and open communication channels amongst parents, teachers, administration and the board to ask questions about their authenticity.\nIn speaking with many parents of all grade levels of students, I consistently hear that there is no open communication, especially with the current board.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nTeachers I've spoken with are frustrated and don't know Blueprint well, and what they do know is vague with no clear guidelines to how it's implemented. Funding Blueprint is based on inequities of and poverty levels of students for priority funding. Blueprint prioritizes equity learning.\nWe need to recognize every student's individuality and work to strengthen those individual skills for college/career readiness. We need to stop looking at certain groups as \"minorities\" and overlooking their skills as worthy individuals capable of learning instead of trying to make everyone \"equal\" to someone else. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was appointed to the post by Gov. Wes Moore in October, 2023.Howie is the assistant principal at Federalsburg Elementary School. She is married and has three children.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI am running for the District 5 seat of the Talbot County Board of Education to represent students, families and other stakeholders. We are making gains in our school district, and I want to continue to ensure that our students and teachers have access to high quality instructional materials that will have an impact on student achievement and success.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy priorities align with the goals set by the members of the Board of Education and the superintendent, Dr. (Shraron) Pepukayi. My two main areas of focus are increasing student achievement in the areas of mathematics and reading, and recruiting and retaining quality teachers.\nHaving teachers that provide outstanding instruction to our students will ensure that our students will be academically successful.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces, and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools face right now is providing exceptional education opportunities for all students while being fiscally responsible.\nCurrently, the curriculum coordinating committee has brought high quality resources to the board for approval in the areas of reading and mathematics. These resources are paid for through educational grants. Utilizing grants is a responsible way of ensuring that we are providing our students with high quality instructional materials while being fiscally responsible.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nThe postcards that have been mailed out focused on student test scores as well as other concerns. In terms of student test scores, we have purchased new high quality instructional materials. Our 2024 data reflects growth in all subgroups as well as certain subject areas and grades.\nStudent test scores are not just a concern for our district but across the State. Through the Governance and Accountability pillar of the Blueprint, expert review teams will be visiting schools across the state to review literacy and mathematics instruction in our classrooms and provide quality feedback for improvement.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nI believe that the pillars of the Blueprint reflect the areas that all Maryland Schools want to address. Those pillars address early childhood education, high quality and diverse teachers, college and career readiness, more resources for students to be successful, and governance and accountability.\nThe Blueprint identifies and prioritizes the needs that we see in our district and across the state. In order for our students to be college and career ready by 10th grade, we need to start addressing their needs in pre-Kindergarten and ensure that they are receiving the resources they need to be successful in every grade. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She practices mediation law and is a director of conflict resolution programs. She is married and has three sons, all of whom graduated from Talbot County Public Schools.She is running for the District 6 seat on the Board of Education.\nWhy are you running for office?\nOur public schools play a pivotal role in shaping our community's future, and we need board members who can help move (Talbot County Public Schools) forward to excellence. With a background in mediation and youth, school, family and community conflict resolution, I listen to all perspectives and value the richness in diversity of opinion.\nI am a collaborative problem solver, skilled at helping people work together to solve complex community challenges. I want to ensure that our board continues to function effectively, advancing schools where every student can thrive. We have many strengths on which to build; together, we can solve any challenge.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy priorities are interrelated: fostering academic excellence, supporting educators and creating a thriving school environment. I am committed to advancing student mastery of essential skills, improving academic proficiency and preparing students for college and careers.\nEnsuring we recruit, retain and support outstanding teachers is key to this vision. Equally important is providing a positive, safe, effective and inclusive school climate where all learners can succeed and promoting strong family and student engagement to build a collaborative, supportive community around our schools. Together, these priorities create the foundation for a bright future for our students.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nAdvancing academic proficiency is a priority. Supporting a positive, safe, effective and inclusive learning environment is fundamental for student success, as well as teacher retention. Finding innovative ways to engage families, including non-English speakers, and students will support all aspects of student success.\nThe current board and superintendent are making progress toward addressing these issues despite many challenges, such as the COVID-19 learning gap. Through additional instructional support, expanding use of innovative community partnerships, strategic use of technology, targeted allocation of resources and engaging all sectors of our community, we can accelerate progress in these areas.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nI would like to see the sender of the mailers come forward for productive and honest dialogue. While improving academic proficiency is essential, the harmful attacks on our teachers, fueled by misleading and inflammatory rhetoric, seem aimed at undermining our public schools and inciting fear.\nI would welcome an open, honest conversation about what this group seeks to accomplish, with accurate, relevant information. Let's work together to lift our Talbot County Public Schools to be the vibrant foundation of our community, where education is valued, everyone can belong and our teachers receive the support they need and deserve.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint for Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nThe creation of the Blueprint was the result of a comprehensive effort with input from many stakeholders. The five pillars are: Early Childhood Education; High Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders; College and Career Readiness; More Resources for Student Success; and Governance and Accountability.\nThe TCPS team has a detailed plan for managing the Blueprint and provides regular reports on progress for public view. There are many areas of the Blueprint that are positive, however, the most challenging aspects are mandates without sufficient funding. I support continued efforts to address the funding formula as it has been applied to Talbot County. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Ann O'Connor\n\n October 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Ann Oconnor \n \n 589\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Ann O'Connor, 55, is a resident of Easton. She is running for the District 2 seat on the Talbot County Board of Education.She is a former teacher and has six children.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI am running for the school board because I am deeply passionate about children's education. As a former teacher and mother of six, I have dedicated my career to helping children reach their highest potential.\nHaving witnessed my six children go through (Talbot County Public School), I have observed a decline in academic rigor, expectations and accountability, both in behavior and academics. This experience drives my desire to make meaningful changes on the school board. The fact that our students are scoring 18% proficient in math and 55% in reading indicates a pressing need for new perspectives on our educational strategies.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy priorities are the ABCs of education: advancing academics, boosting accountability and cultivating character. The focus is on the whole child. We cannot advance academics without discipline.\nWhen students develop self-discipline, good character naturally emerges. This requires daily practice and consistent reinforcement of rules and clear expectations for all students across all buildings. Disruptive behavior must be addressed promptly and effectively.\nRegarding academic accountability: A 95% graduation rate when less than ¼ of our students are proficient in math skills, and less than ½ are reading on grade level is inconsistent — something is broken here and we need to fix it.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most important issue is the steady decline of academic rigor. We need to make sure we continue to implement early intervention in elementary schools to support those who need that extra push. It's essential to send home books and ensure that our children have access to/and are accountable for reading materials throughout elementary, middle and high school.\nWe should place greater emphasis on traditional learning — using pencils and paper, cursive writing, fostering reading and critical thinking skills, while reducing reliance on computers. We need to offer pathways for middle school students interested in college or the workforce, including advanced/honors classes.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nThe postcards received in the mail are snapshots of where our schools stand. No one wants these scores, they are abysmal. It's a wake up call to attack the problem and change the way we have been doing education here in Talbot County.\nWe need to put our focus on reading, writing and math. Our students are distracted. Let's eliminate anything that detracts from our mission as educators and focus on what truly matters — educating the child. Let's get back to basics with my ABCs of education.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nSimply changing a name doesn't lead to improvement. Over the last two decades, this initiative has gone through four name changes. Although there are many wonderful proposals in the Blueprint, I don't believe that top-down programs created by education experts would make our local schools better.\nThe Blueprint is a blanket principle mandated for all 24 counties in Maryland. The counties have no say in how it is implemented. It removes the schools from the control of locally elected school boards and puts control in the hands of unelected officials. I believe we want control over our local schools. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

She lives in Easton with her family of four.Henry is the director of the Disability Resource Center at Salisbury University.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI am running for reelection to the Board of Education to ensure that every student, regardless of ability, background or language, has equal access to quality education. My focus on accessibility, equity and belonging stems from a commitment to create inclusive learning environments where all students feel valued and supported.\nI believe in breaking down barriers to success, advocating for diverse voices and fostering a sense of community in our schools. By addressing the unique needs of all learners, I aim to promote educational outcomes that empower every student to reach their full potential.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy priorities are consistent with TCPS' current philosophy of \"transforming and performing.\" I want the public to know that the Board of Education operates as a collective and is not driven by individual agendas.\nI am committed to the collective goals to prioritize narrowing and closing the opportunity and achievement gaps, eliminating barriers to education, recruiting and retaining high-quality educators, enhancing special education services, continuous improvement in reading and math proficiency, enhancing our summer school offerings, and early access to college preparatory, dual enrollment, and CTE programs.\nWhat is the most important issue that Talbot County Public Schools faces and how do you think the board needs to address it?\nThe most important issue facing (Talbot County Public Schools) is the opportunity gap, which directly affects reading and math proficiency for all students. To address this, the board must continue to prioritize equitable distribution of resources, ensuring that schools serving higher-need populations have access to targeted interventions.\nSimultaneously, recruiting and retaining high-quality educators is vital, as teachers are the foundation of student success. By investing in professional development and creating supportive environments for educators, we can close the opportunity gap and improve outcomes and opportunities for all students.\nTalbot County residents have been receiving postcards in the mail criticizing education in the county. What are your thoughts on the postcards and how should these concerns be addressed?\nThe postcards critical of Talbot County's education system are deeply troubling because they disparage the hard work of our educators. Much of the content includes outdated and inaccurate information, which undermines trust in our schools and the dedicated professionals working to support our students.\nThese types of messages are circulated with the intent to create division rather than foster productive dialogue. To address these concerns, we must continue to engage the community in open discussion, lead with facts — highlighting the progress being made and the work that still needs to be done, all while celebrating the efforts of our educators.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future presents significant benefits by prioritizing equity, early childhood education and career readiness, which can help close the opportunity gap and enhance student success. It also aims to improve educator salaries and professional development, which are crucial for recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers.\nMy concern is ensuring that the funding remains sustainable and that implementation is equitable, especially for rural areas like Talbot County. It's essential that all schools receive the resources needed to meet these ambitious goals, with careful oversight to ensure progress and accountability across the state. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She has also served as president of the Advisory Board for St. Michaels YMCA.She has been married for 22 years and has five children ranging from 14 to 20 years old. She is running for the District 6 seat on the Board of Education.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI'm running for office because I have seen a decline in education since my oldest child started in (Talbot County Public Schools). I believe all our children deserve better. No one is going to care more or be more passionate about solving issues that face our schools today than a mother with four children in the system. I care deeply about our schools, I pay attention, and I love our community. I'm a mom who wants to prioritize education and improve outcomes.\nWhat are your priorities if elected?\nMy top priority is to ensure all students are college or career ready by the time they graduate. I want to see all students obtain critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, it's important for students to have personal responsibility, financial literacy, strong communication, and respect for themselves and others.

I believe this is not about placing blame but about transparency.\nIt brings the issue to the attention of Talbot County residents, which positions us better to solve the problem. Once we realize where we are today, we can determine where we want to go and how to get there. If everyone can unite around a common goal of increasing test scores in reading and math, we can more quickly work together to solve this issue.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Blueprint For Maryland's Future? What concerns or benefits do you see?\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's future mandates so many requirements that it's difficult for our local school system to continue programs they feel are successful. Having the authority to make decisions at the local level will allow citizens of Talbot County to address the needs of our community schools more effectively. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Upon entering the school, students will place their phones in the pouches and use a Yondr magnet to lock the pouch. During dismissal, students will use the same magnetic device to unlock the pouches and retrieve their phones.\nEinhorn said the district has talked to Yondr representatives about ensuring there are enough magnets in case of an emergency.\n\"They've been able to share with us some best practices, which include how many magnets you would need per student in the building to be able to effectively and efficiently get students out at the end of the day,\" Einhorn said.\nLike Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said prior to his district's rollout, Einhorn emphasized that cell phones can be a distraction during emergencies.\n\"We've had conversations and heard from national experts that during a real school emergency, it is actually greater safety risk for 800 students to be pulling out their phones and making phone calls instead of listening to the directions that will help keep them safe,\" she told board members.\nDebbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools, said each pouch costs about $27. In all, 975 pouches were purchased for a total just below $27,000, \"paid for from the local FY24 materials of instruction budget,\" Gardner said.\nBoard Vice President Candace Henry asked how long it will take students to put their phones in pouches and retrieve them at the beginning and end of each day. Einhorn and Pepukayi said they expect it will take some time at first but that the process should become simple and streamlined over time.\nEaston Middle families will receive more details from the district about the pouch program later this week, and a presentation will be given to students on Friday.\nBoard Member Deborah Bridges inquired if the pilot program may extend to other schools in the district this year if it is deemed successful.\n\"I do think we will need to see at least this year what our data is telling us about the impact,\" Einhorn said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He often stated that \"whenever the people are well informed, they can be trusted with their own government.\"As a country, I believe we should heed the words of our founding father as we head to the polls in November. Our democracy depends on it.\nEarlier this month, librarians, booksellers, educators, authors and readers throughout the country participated in Banned Books Week, the annual event that highlights the value of free and open access to information. In preparation, The American Library Association released preliminary data documenting attempts to censor books and materials in public, school, and academic libraries during the first eight months of 2024.\nThe findings are alarming: Between January 1 and August 31, 2024, ALA tracked 414 attempts to censor library materials and services. In those cases, 1,128 unique titles were challenged. Especially troubling is the fact that 47% of the books targeted for censorship are titles representing the voices and lived experiences of people of color and people who identify as LGBTQ+.\nThese attempts to silence diverse voices in our community are deliberate, coordinated and dangerous. Public and school libraries should be safe havens of knowledge and information, offering access to a variety of viewpoints and empowering readers to be informed citizens.\nThis Saturday, Oct. 19, has been designated the Freedom to Read Day of Action by Unite Against Book Bans, an organization dedicated to protecting the First Amendment rights of all Americans (uniteagainstbookbans.org). Concerned citizens can join in the fight against censorship by learning about book bans, reading a banned book or participating in the activities on the website. Above all, we can take the pledge to stand with readers across the U.S. in support of the Freedom to Read and vote.\nMARY PELLICANO\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Thoughts on smart phone restrictions in schools\n\n October 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 981\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A recent Pew Research Center survey reports that 95% of teenagers in America have a smart phone or have access to one. It also reports that 45% of teenagers say they are online nearly all the time.Many have suggested this has resulted in a measurable and serious negative impact on the learning environment in middle and high school classrooms. Others have suggested this has resulted in a serious negative impact on standardized student achievement test scores.\nAs a result, countless school districts in America have put or will be putting new or more restrictions on student smart phones during the school day. Two-thirds of schools in Maryland have already. Talbot County is joining them. Beginning Dec. 2, Easton Middle School will will require students to lock their phones in secure pouches during the school day.\nThese restrictions have significant public support. Surveys conducted by the Talbot County school district reported 94% of parents/guardians and 96% of staff said there should be restrictions on cell phone use during the school day. 90% of parents/guardians and 95% of staff said students should not be allowed to have their phones \"visible and usable\" during class instruction.\nWhile I understand and respect these opinions, I suggest restrictions in schools are not addressing more deeply seated roots of the problem.\nIn his most recent book, \"The Anxious Generation How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness\" social psychologist Jonathan Stephen Haidt does a deep dive on a measurable surge in anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts among American youth.\nI understand and respect these decisions. At the same time, I suggest they are not addressing more deeply seated roots of the problem.\nIn his most recent book, \"The Anxious Generation How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness\" social psychologist Jonathan Stephen Haidt does a deep dive on a measurable surge in anxiety, depression, and suicidality among American youth.\nIn his book Haidt references research showing a measure of anxiety for individuals between ages of 8 to 25 has increased 139% between 2010 and 2020.The measure for depression during the same period, often the result of an inability to resolve interpersonal conflicts or relationship difficulties, has increased 106%.\nHaidt suggests three reasons why.\nThe first is the decline of the what Haidt calls play-based childhood. He maintains children need lots of free play time to prepare them for success as an adult. Out of fears for their safety, many American parents and guardians have reduced children's access to unsupervised free play. The loss of free play and the rise of continual (some may say \"smothering\") adult supervision has deprived children of what they needed most to overcome the normal fears and anxieties of childhood: the chance to explore, test and expand their limits, build close friendships through shared adventure and learn how to judge risks for themselves.\nThe second is what Haidt calls rise of the phone-based childhood, which began in the late 2000s and accelerated in the early 2010s. Haidt notes this was precisely the period during which adolescents traded in their flip phones for smartphones. These smartphones were loaded with social media platforms supported by the new high-speed internet and unlimited data plans that has drastically reshaped the social media landscape for adolescents.\nThe third is what Heidt calls an over reliance on technology that has all but eliminated unstructured face to face interactions from the lives of children and adolescents.\nHeidt concludes the negative impact of all three reasons was made worse by many well-intentioned parents, including himself. He writes: \"We did not fully understand what was happening in children's virtual worlds and did not grasp that tech companies had designed their online products to be addictive.\"\nAs a result, Haidt asserts that all these trends combined, have robbed entire generations of opportunities to develop the resilience, coping skills and independence needed to navigate everyday stressors, and in turn, created unprecedented levels of anxiety at a societal level.\nHe says these generations have not learned from valuable opportunities to engage in and learn from manageable risks, typical setbacks, failures and healthy social challenges.\nWhat can be done going forward?\nHaidt offers the following proactive suggestions for parents and guardians of children in elementary, middle and high schools.\nInstead of a giving younger students a smartphone as their first phone, give them a basic phone.\nDo not give them a smartphone until high school. Delay the opening of accounts on nearly all social media platforms until the beginning of high school, at least.\nWill his suggestions be popular with students? Not likely, especially given the immense power of peer pressure that characterizes life for students in schools at all levels.\nOne school in Maryland recently surveyed seniors on a new more restrictive smart phone policy to limit the overuse of smart phones during the school day. The questions and answers were: \"Do you know overuse of cell phones is harmful? Yes. Do you want to give it up? No.\"\nAre Haidt's suggestions still necessary since efforts are underway when an increasing number of schools are adopting on new or more restrictive rules on smart phone access? Yes.\nDespite best intentions and best efforts, schools alone cannot address this problem. One Maryland school district superintendent has observed with thinly disguised frustration — \"Students are in school for just 20% of their week. We can't control the other 80% of the time that we don't have them.\"\nThose with some control over most of the other 80% of student's time outside of school are parents and guardians.\nGoing forward, parents and guardians need to fully embrace two concepts. Success for them is not based on winning a popularity contest with those whom they are entrusted with their care and upbringing. Success for them is measured in part by a willingness to make sometimes unpopular, but necessary decisions on reasonable limits for a young person's own good.\nIn preparing all our young people for success, they, and our society deserve nothing less. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester ends alternative education contract in middle, elementary schools\n\n October 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 448\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Four months since the Dorchester County Board of Education voted to terminate its more than three-year contract with an alternative education program for high schoolers, the board has decided to terminate its one-year contract with an alternative education program for elementary and middle school students.At a Board of Education meeting Thursday, the board unanimously voted to terminate it's contract with Transforming Lives for convenience. The service provided alternative education for up to 48 Dorchester County Public Schools elementary and middle school students at one time.\nBoard members did not comment on the decision to terminate the contract at the meeting.\nReview of the contract was not originally on Thursday's meeting agenda. The board voted to add it it to the agenda after board member Chris Wheedleton made a motion to do so. Later in the meeting, Wheedleton made a motion to terminate the contract for convenience, which the board unanimously voted in favor of.\nWheedleton did not immediately respond for comment on the decision.\nAccording to the contract, either party can terminate it for any or no reason with 60-days advance written notice.\nThe program, called Positive Change Academy-Dorchester, began this past summer and was set to end June 30, 2025. It is housed at The Judy Center at Sandy Hill Elementary School and at the New Directions Learning Academy. It cost the district $79,000 per month.\nThe board approved the contract at a special Board of Education meeting in July. At that meeting, district Superintendent Jymil Thompson said the district looked at this program as one stop in a student's education journey. He said it would be a place where students could remedy behavior and improve academics before going back into a \"regular educational setting.\"\nThe district did not immediately respond for comment on the board's decision.\nThis is not the first time the board has terminated an alternative education contract in the past year.\nIn June, the Board of Education voted to terminate its more than three-year contract with Vision Quest, an alternative education program for district high schoolers that had been met with criticism from residents since the contract was approved in September 2023. The district had been paying Vision Quest $93,363 per month for services, which would have added up to over $3.3 million over three years.\nThe decision to terminate the Vision Quest contract was one of the reasons former Dorchester County Board of Education Vice President Susan Morgan resigned in June. She was the sole vote in favor of keeping the contract. In an interview with the Star Democrat in June, Morgan said the district needed an alternative program for the fall that would benefit the students as much as she witnessed first-hand with the success of Vision Quest. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Group promotes extremist agenda\n\n October 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 402\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As a former teacher in Talbot County, I find the local school board races concerning. Ironically, hate groups in America like to name themselves after our most deeply held values, while acting against those values. Moms for Liberty (M4L) is one such group.Moms For Liberty has an active chapter here in Talbot County. Nationally, M4L was included as an extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, in its annual report because it advances an anti-student inclusion agenda.\nThe M4L definition of liberty is that we have the freedom to believe as they do. Our citizens need to know the extremist agenda of M4L evidenced below. Voters need to know that voting for their candidates will turn over the Board of Education majority to M4L.\nAccording to USA Today, the group, which identifies itself as a \"parental rights organization,\" is known for calls to ban books in schools. Founded in Florida, three members have been named to the Department of Education workgroup that oversees school libraries. One cannot help but wonder how influential they were in developing the new standards that require students be taught that being enslaved was beneficial to Black Americans because it helped them acquire new skills.\nI encourage you to speak with local Black citizens to hear their views on this.\nIt is critical in this election year that Talbot County voters reject the three candidates supported by the local Moms for Liberty chapter. I have seen the posts claiming that M4L supports, but doesn't endorse these candidates.\nEither these candidates did no homework into M4L or they know their agenda and concur. In my opinion, either option disqualifies Ann O'Connor, Karla Wieland-Cherry and Kerry Gunshenan. Candidates who can't be bothered to understand the agenda of the groups that support them are potential pawns in the hands of extremists. Candidates who agree with M4L would engulf our system in culture wars that do nothing to advance the education of our children.\nIf you live in a district with a school board race this election, one of these three names will appear: Candace Henry, Anna Howie or Cynthia Marrah Jurrius. I respectfully ask you to vote for one of them.\nI can promise you that the educators in this county truly want what is best for our children, and they are the ones qualified to make decisions about their education.\nMoms for Liberty's hateful rhetoric and anti-inclusive agenda does not belong anywhere in our schools.\nTARA LEESON\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Should Maryland schools ban cellphones?\n\n October 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sasha Allen and Audrey Keefe Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1407\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n \"FOCUS NOW! PHONES LATER,\" blares the newest school cellphone policy out of Washington County.This \"clear message\" debuted on the county's website in August, kicking off the 2024 school year with stricter limitations on personal electronic devices.\nThat message is one that resonates with Maryland's school board candidates. Of the 74 candidates who responded to the Local News Network's campaign questionnaire, 64 favored strict restrictions on cellphones in schools, and only 10 expressed reservations about limiting cellphone use or touted their positive aspects.\nBoard candidates cited a number of reasons — ranging from disciplinary issues to cyberbullying to phone addiction — for ordering students to put their phones out of sight.\nSome candidates offered nuanced proposals for limiting cellphone use — but support for greater restrictions spans the state, from large counties to small.\nRita Montoya, a lawyer who is running for an at-large school board seat from Montgomery County, said the district's cellphone policy should be \"away all day\" — which is the name of a pilot program in the district this year.\n\"As a parent, I understand the need for some students to have a cellphone with them at school, but it should not be used at school so as to limit distractions and negative peer interactions including violence,\" she said.\nWashington County already requires all devices to be off and out of sight during instructional hours in its schools. Robin Merchant Spickler, a former kindergarten teacher and current school board candidate in the western Maryland county, fully supports the new policy.\n\"This has been a long time coming. It is in the best interest of the students' well-being and their academic progress,\" she said. \"It will help the students learn in a positive and productive environment.\"\nA growing trendSchools across the state have already begun implementing stricter cellphone policies in public schools. According to a survey conducted by the Capital News Service this fall, at least a third of Maryland school districts have tightened their cellphone regulations this school year alone.\nHowever, these policies vary. Some schools prohibit students from using their devices throughout the entire school day, while others, such as Anne Arundel County, allow high school students to use them during lunch only.\nSome counties have begun forcing students to lock away their phones. In Baltimore County, 16 middle and high schools have issued clear pouches in which students must insert their phones to make them harder to access during class time.\nAnnette Anderson, the deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools, said there are good reasons for mimimizing cellphone use among youngsters.\n\"What we know is that it's shifting the way that the brains of the developing child is growing,\" Anderson said. \"There's a lot of concern in terms of the mental health of our young people.\"\nBetween 2008 and 2015, hospitals in the U.S. reported suicidal ideation or attempts among children and adolescents ages 14 to 18 almost doubled, according to a 2020 study. Published by the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the study delved into the relationship between youth cellphone and social media use and mental health.\nThe study found that internet addiction is \"particularly associated\" with self-harm and suicidal behavior.\nAnderson said cellphone use also hinders students' ability to develop interpersonal connections vital to job performance later in life.\n\"What's happening actually is that students are so focused on this phone that's in front of their faces that they're not actually having interpersonal dialogue,\" Anderson said. \"They're not having the kinds of conversations at the lunchroom, at the lunch table in their classrooms.\"\nTeachers nationwide are worried about cellphone use, too, according to a survey from the Pew Research Center from June. The survey found that 72 percent of high school teachers alone cite cellphone distractions in the classroom as a \"major problem.\"\nMany school board candidates also said cellphones have become a distraction.\nIn Calvert County, cellphones are banned in classrooms, and school board candidate and former educator Michael Shisler backs that ban.\n\"This problem did not happen overnight, and it will not be solved overnight,\" said Shisler, who spent nearly 30 years as an elementary school principal. \"Cellphones have moved beyond a distraction to being an addiction — an addiction that brings increased social pressures and the need for constant social validation.\"\nAllegany County school board candidate and Frostburg State University professor Gerry LaFemina agreed. He said the impact cellphones and social media have on students is the most jarring problem in county schools that he hopes to address.\n\"Besides being a distraction, the dopamine hit of responding to notifications can have an addictive effect on our students. This can lead to educational and disciplinary issues,\" LaFemina said.\nLaFemina did not specify what policies he would implement if elected, but the county has light limitations on use in the classroom, often leaving it up to teacher discretion.\nSt. Mary's County candidate Mary Washington, who has served on the board for the past 27 years, said she is pleased with the county's new plan to restrict phone use during instructional time.\n\"This change will focus on increasing learning and achievement, promoting a safe and orderly school, diminishing discipline referrals, and nourishing more face-to-face contact with each other,\" Washington said.\nDifferent perspectivesWhile most school board candidates throughout the state provided a variety of concerns surrounding cellphone use in schools, many had different perspectives on what a ban should look like in their county.\nOut of Prince George's County, lawyer, substitute teacher and school board candidate Angela R. Jones said she supports tighter regulation but not a full ban.\n\"I propose a balanced cellphone policy that allows limited use during non-instructional times, such as lunch and between classes while prohibiting use during lessons,\" said Jones, the legislative director for the Maryland State Senate. \"This approach respects students' need for connectivity and emergency contact while minimizing distractions during instructional time.\"\nIn addition to the social connectivity phones can provide students, some candidates cited the educational use of devices in schools, saying they can be used in the classroom in moderation.\nLetonya Smalls is also running for the school board in Charles County. She has a doctorate in education leadership and said she has seen students benefit directly from phone usage in the classroom.\n\"I remember one of my students pulling out his cellphone to take a picture years ago. I asked what he was doing, and he said, 'I am taking a picture of the homework, Ms. Smalls,'\" Smalls said. \"He smiled, and I honestly didn't make a big deal out of it because I knew it worked for him. Each student is different, and each student learns differently.\"\nSmalls proposed a strict policy enforced by teachers during instructional time but not a complete ban. However, like some other candidates, Smalls said she believes that students and parents should be involved in developing any new policy. She proposed a contract for cellphone use for both parents and students to review and sign.\nIn Frederick County, school board candidate Veronica Lowe took a similar stance.\n\"I don't believe in creating a policy without fully understanding the issues and concerns that led to its development,\" said Lowe, former director of transportation for Frederick County Schools. \"We need to gather a collaborative group that includes parents, students, teachers, support staff, administrators, bus drivers and community members to ensure diverse perspectives are considered.\"\nLowe also brought up the intersection of school safety and cellphone policy and said she believes that in light of recent school shootings, students need to have a way to communicate in emergencies.\nAnd one candidate — Maisie T. Howard of Anne Arundel County — voiced concerns that a ban would do more harm than good, especially for special needs students, those from rural areas and those who thrive in virtual environments.\n\"The cellphone is not the enemy,\" she said. \"For many of us, it is our only computer.\"\nIn contrast, some candidates, like Ann O'Connor from Talbot County, believe in a full ban in elementary and middle schools, along with emergency access only in high schools. O'Connor, a former high school Spanish teacher and mother of six, said she believes a tougher phone policy could decrease mental health issues, bullying and distraction in schools.\n\"If Talbot County wants to lead the way on protecting our kids from short attention spans and gaps in core knowledge, this is the No. 1 thing that needs to happen,\" O'Connor said.\nAnd O'Connor said those most in the know about the county's schools agree with her.\n\"I have talked to a number of teachers about cellphone use in school, and they unanimously tell me the same thing,\" O'Connor said. \"Ban them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Each section provides simple lessons on key concepts such as voice projection, body language, and audience engagement, all while allowing children to express their creativity through art.\n\"Confidence in Every Word: Activity Book for Young Speakers\" — In this activity book, Montgomery incorporates engaging puzzles, games, and scenarios that encourage kids to practice their speaking skills. Activities range from creating short speeches to role-playing different speaking situations, empowering children to build confidence and develop effective communication strategies.\n\"The Little Speaker's Toolkit: Coloring and Crafting Your Speech\" — This book combines creative expression with practical speech preparation. Children are guided through the process of developing their own speeches, with templates for brainstorming ideas and spaces to illustrate their thoughts. By emphasizing storytelling and personal experiences, kids understand the importance of connecting with their audience.\nMontgomery's books, which reflects her commitment to inclusivity and representation, feature diverse characters and relatable scenarios, allowing children from various backgrounds to see themselves in the material. This approach not only fosters engagement, but also helps to build a sense of belonging and confidence in young readers.\nPublic speaking is a vital skill that lays the foundation for effective communication, critical thinking, and self-confidence. Montgomery's series highlights the significance of these skills from a young age, equipping children with the tools they need to articulate their thoughts, advocate for themselves, and participate actively in discussions. By making public speaking approachable and fun, she encourages children to embrace their voices.\nMontgomery's series of coloring and activity books on public speaking is a remarkable contribution to children's literature and education. Through her engaging and creative approach, she is nurturing a new generation of confident communicators who are ready to express their unique perspectives.\nBy inspiring kids to find their voices and share their stories, Montgomery is not only shaping their futures but also empowering them to shine in all areas of their lives. Her work is a testament to the to the transformative power of education and the importance of fostering communication skills in every child.\nFor more information, go to www.speakezforkids.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This campaign unfairly targets our schools, students, and dedicated Talbot County Public Schools educators.\nOur team does face challenges like many school districts, and we face them directly and with transparency. While we do not want to give life to these messages you are receiving, we want to make sure our community knows the truth.\nWe are working to improve our performance on state assessments. With support from the Talbot County Council, we have made significant investments, including acquiring new rigorous standards-based curricula and hiring and retaining qualified teachers and administrators. Additionally, we have made math one of our priorities and are putting concentrated efforts into the teaching and learning of this curricular area. We also know that student success is measured by many indicators in addition to state assessment scores.\nWhile we know we have work to do, there is growth we can celebrate. The 23-24 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment results showed modest improvement across all Maryland districts. In Talbot County, our overall margin of progress was slightly greater than what the state achieved. In English/Language Arts, out of the 24 school districts, Talbot County Public Schools had the greatest increase in students being proficient. These results inform our continued work on the initiatives put in place to provide our educators with the resources needed to ensure student success.\nWe adhere to the Health Education Standards set forth by the Maryland Department of Education. Maryland state law requires that parents/guardians be notified about topics covered in the Family Life unit. They have the option of having their student excused if they are uncomfortable with this content being taught to their students by TCPS educators.\nOur Talbot County students graduate from our high schools and continue to excel in college, career and life. This is a result of their hard work, the commitment of the TCPS team, the leadership of the Board of Education and the support of the County Council and our many community partners.\nOur support staff, teachers and administrators are dedicated professionals who deserve our trust and support. By collaborating openly and constructively, we can ensure that our school system remains a beacon of opportunity and excellence for every child, regardless of their background.\nWe invite the community to our established public forums scheduled each month through our regular Board of Education meetings. These meetings are open to all citizens, and we encourage everyone to attend and participate in these sessions. Only through collaboration and communication do we truly provide the best opportunities for our students.\nWe are honored to serve as Talbot County's superintendent of schools and president of the Board of Education, and we are very proud of our students and staff. We believe in and will continue to advocate for TCPS students, families and educators. We are TCPS, and we are committed to transforming and performing together.\nIf you have questions or concerns, please email us at info@talbotschools.org. We are here for you and all of the children of Talbot County. Thank you for your continued support.\nSharon Pepukayi is the superintendent of Talbot County Public Schools.

MICHAELS — The holiday season has come early at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, and boys and girls of a variety of ages are working diligently to craft wooden Christmas trees, stockings, snowmen and marine life to sell as ornaments.As schools across the nation are closing vocational skill programs, the museum's Rising Tide After-School program is filling the gap by providing middle school students the opportunity to learn marketing and vocational skills under the supervision of dedicated volunteers.\nThis program lasts seven weeks and caters to students in grades six through nine. The students learn project design and development, team collaboration tool management and workshop safety.\nAlyssa Zajan, the student and public programs manager, said the students choose the projects they work on for the duration of the program.\n\"This year, they got in the holiday spirit, so they've been making ornaments,\" Zajan said. \"They've been hand cutting them, using hand saws, as well as some of our saws and our power saws, and decorating them. And they're going to market them to the community.\"\nThe ornaments will be included in the museum's store. Students will be choosing price points and learning marketing skills.\nAll proceeds for the ornaments will go back into the program to help it continue.\nAccording to Jill Ferris, Rising Tide's vice president of education and interpretation, the program began in 2017 as a boat building program and has evolved to better serve the core mission of providing middle school students in Talbot County a fun and safe environment where they can access skills education.\nFerris said schools in the area have not been in the position to provide the vocation training they had in the past. The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum sought to provide that kind of experience for students to be able to work with mentors and educators and learn different skills.\n\"How do we connect students and help them develop skills to be the future leaders and pursue pathways that they are interested in, and so the idea of taking an entrepreneurial pathway was one that we just thought was really fun and would be really resonant for the kids,\" Ferris said.\nThe program runs on a quarterly basis, with the next session opening in January 2025. Ferris said accessibility is a core value of the program, and participants are offered partial to full scholarships as well as transportation for students who live outside of St. Michaels.\nHarper Black, a student in the program, said she has enjoyed being in the program and is happy with the work she has been able to accomplish.\n\"It's really cool to work with things you haven't experienced yet,\" Black said. \"Because you don't have the materials at home. So it's cool to come here and do it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "School mailing accusations are false\n\n November 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 391\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Talbot county residents have recently been receiving U.S. Postal Service mailings questioning the quality of teaching in our county's public schools. Among its many criticisms, the glossy mailings falsely decry the low English and math proficiency and attribute these low scores to time wasted \"forcing harmful gender ideology\" on students.Here are some facts: 39% of students in Talbot County are classified as \"economically disadvantaged\" (data gathered by US News and World Report), and 40% are members of a minority. Fully 14% of students study English as a second language. Talbot County Public Schools is one of only eight districts out of the 24 in Maryland that earned star ratings of three or higher for all schools. (reportcard.msde.maryland.gov)\nIn 2023 Talbot County Schools boasted an attendance rate of 91.5% and a high school graduation rate of 95%. Schools also showed year over year improvement in academic achievement. These are numbers to be proud of, not scorned.\nSo where are these accusations and false claims coming from? They are originating from a group identifying itself as \"Pay Attention America Inc.\" with a postal address listed as 1000 N. West St, Suite 1200, Wilmington, Delaware. In its mailings, it cites the \"Daily Citizen\" whose director of communications claims: \"God has declared certain things 'good' and certain things 'bad.' He's given us clear principles to use in considering current events. And He's spoken clearly on the subjects of life, marriage, law and government. We cannot remain morally neutral in our reporting.\"\nAre we all to believe that God has spoken directly to the Daily Citizen and told it what is good and what is bad and facts are irrelevant? The mailings scream \"radical politicians are pushing extreme radical agendas\" and \"radical indoctrination\" of children is taking place in the schools.\nUnfortunately, our public schools make an easy target for out of state organizations with a defined political agenda. It is sad that their misrepresentations and slurs seek to divide our community instead of seeking solutions in a positive, fact-based approach. We believe it is important, more now than ever, to make decisions based on facts, not gobbledygook.\nUltimately, we question why a Delaware religious organization finds it necessary to alarm us when all Talbot citizens have to do is simply talk to our teachers and our school administrators about our concerns.\nThat is how local control works.\nJIM WILKINS\nMARTHA HAMLYN\nJIM RICHARDSON\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I urge you to learn about your school board candidates and what they stand for.I'm not a mother, but I feel strongly about voting for the best candidate for my school board district (District 2). That candidate is Candace Henry.\nAs the product of public schools from Grades 5-12 myself, I want someone on the board who is interested in creating a diverse, inviting and equitable atmosphere for all children in every classroom.\nAs a librarian by training, I feel strongly about access to information and books for all. Parents who want to have a say in their children's reading material should have that, but that desire should not interfere with anyone else's access to information. The transparency and opportunity already exist for those who want to examine and/or opt out of certain materials.\nAs a county resident, I am invested in the futures of its students. The best future for them, and for the rest of us, is for students to have equal access to high-quality educational materials and opportunities for success. As our future citizens and leaders, they should be learning empathy.\nCandace Henry is the incumbent District 2 candidate. She brings decades of experience in education to the board. As a TCPS graduate and mother of current county public school students, she is dedicated to the success of the school system and every student therein.\nWhile the race for school board is non-partisan, the opposition candidate is backed by Moms for Liberty. This group focuses on policing access to materials that promote diversity, minorities and marginalized groups. They seek to remove protections for LGBTQ+ students when they are at their most vulnerable. They seek to divide, restrict and exclude.\nCandace Henry is running on a platform of excellence, equity and inclusivity for all students in Talbot County. If you are in District 2, please vote to reelect Candace Henry to the school board. Anna Howie and Cynthia Jurrius are the other two candidates to support in their respective districts. They are also running against Moms for Liberty-supported candidates.\nYour vote matters. Please be ready to make selections for every position up for a vote on the ballot. Be sure to vote for the candidate who best represents your values.\nMISSY CORLEY\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Student vets' stories provide unique insight on service\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Kesha Williams Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 810\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Administrators and students at Elizabeth City's three institutions of higher education gathered at College of The Albemarle on Thursday for a unique Veterans Day observance.During the event, veterans enrolled at COA, Mid-Atlantic Christian University, and Elizabeth City State University talked about their military experiences and how their decision to serve their country had affected their lives and career choices.\nBobby Martin, a student at MACU, joined the U.S. Navy after high school in 1977. His dad, a Vietnam era veteran and minister, was his role model, he said. When his dad's colleagues visited their home to enjoy meals and football games, Martin said he heard first-hand accounts about what it meant to serve in the military.\n\"These men were inspirations to me,\" Martin said. \"I have been to the North Pole, Europe, Middle East and East Africa while in the Navy. I'm 66 years old, put my wife and child through school, and now I'm working on my ministry degree at Mid-Atlantic Christian University. \"\nWendra Costly, a U.S. Army veteran now enrolled at COA, recalled how she left the U.S. Army in 2018 wondering what she would do. While her job in the military was in information technology, and there are promising job opportunities in that field, Costly wasn't persuaded IT would provide her with the long-term career she was seeking.\nAnd as a wife and mother of four, Costly said she knew it was important to have a rewarding career with good pay.\n\"I called the aviation department (at COA) and got some information about their program. I finally decided that aviation was the way to go for (me in) our area,\" she said.\nCostly also talked about some of the challenges veterans face when they go back to school.\n\"We are older, and we have had some experiences that a good amount of college adults will not be able to relate to,\" she said.\nBut overcoming challenges is something you learn to do in the military, Costly said.\n\"Just like all the hard things you accomplished in the military like training, running in the rain, heat and cold — we can do them,\" she said.\nMichelle Barnes, who is enrolled at ECSU, spent eight years working as an aviation electronics technician in the U.S. Navy. Barnes said the fear of traveling to unfamiliar places and the potential of having to face danger nearly delayed her decision to enlist.\nBut she's glad she did enlist. Barnes said her job in the Navy was challenging and provided steady pay.\nToday, she's glad she accepted the challenges the military offered. She met her husband, who is currently enlisted, while she was in service. Serving in the military also has helped her pay for her college expenses.\n\"Joining the military was the best decision that I could have ever made at the age of 25,\" Barnes said. \"I decided to embrace all that the Navy had to offer me in honor of those who fought and died for this country's freedom. \"\nBarnes said she will graduate in 2026 with a bachelor of science degree in aviation science with a concentration in professional aeronautics and a minor in unmanned aerial systems.\nDr. Catherine Edmonds, ECSU's interim chancellor, applauded her colleagues at MACU and COA for helping area veterans return to school to learn new skills. She also thanked the veterans who attended the event.\n\"Although we work every day to assist and honor our veterans, today is set aside specifically to recognize all of our veterans for their service and sacrifices,\" she said. \"We are a military-friendly university, proud to continue a tradition of excellence serving military members, veterans, and their families.\"\nBane Angles, vice president of student services at MACU and also a veteran, said he was impressed by the student veterans' stories. He also was glad, he said, that the city's three institutions of higher education could come together and offer an event like Thursday's.\n\"There are many important lessons I learned from serving in the military,\" Angles said. \"Not least of these is the importance of unity. No matter where a person is from, what accent they have, what race they are, or creed they follow, all are part of something bigger.\n\"In a society that is too divided for many reasons, we can learn from our armed forces that a higher purpose brings us together in unity. I pray for the day when our country is not divided but is united,\" Angles said.\nCOA President Dr. Jack Bagwell said the community college was proud to host Thursday's event. He also applauded the veterans in the audience for their service and urged them to help the college serve them better.\n\"We believe we can get better everyday,\" he said. \"With you helping us there are things we have not thought of yet that will serve you better. Please share those. We are always open to your feedback. We're certainly open to how we can be more military friendly.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Athens High School holds Veterans Day event for students\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Gabriel Scotto APG Media | Section: News \n \n 570\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ATHENS - Ahead of Monday's Veterans Day celebrations, Athens High School held a special assembly for its students to talk and hear from veterans throughout Athens County.According to a study conducted by the United States Census Bureau in 2022, 6.2% of the adult population are veterans. However, this number has fallen significantly. In 2005, there were 23.4 million veterans. By 2022, there were only 16.2 million, with nearly half of those being 65 or older. There are only 795,600 veterans who served in the Second World War or the Korean War.\nIt is for these reasons that Melissa Myers, student council advisor and a French teacher at Athens High School, says this event is important. Myers recounted when she volunteered at an assisted living home while in high school and formed a bond with a Belgian woman who'd lived through the World Wars and how it changed her perspective.\n\"You can study history and read books and watch movies, but you never truly get an understanding of what people have gone through,\" Myers said. \"It's (about) making those stories come to life and having a better appreciation.\"\nMyers' perspective is also shaped by her father, who served in the Army National Guard, as well as her time serving in the Peace Corps. She hopes talking to veterans will help high school students gain a similar perspective on the importance of service and on fighting for a cause that's greater than oneself.\n\"Hopefully for our high school students it helps our young people understand, no matter what your positions are on various things, everyone who serves, they're serving their country. It's one single vision.\"\nThe main event at the Veterans Day assembly was a speech from Chad Springer, associate superintendent at Athens City Schools and a former United States Army sergeant. Springer felt it was important to share his experience with the students of Athens High School, even if he personally prefers to celebrate Veterans Day quietly.\n\"Some veterans like to go to the public events and things like that,\" Springer said. \"Generally, I don't, because service is very personal to me, because all of us had our own reasons for serving.\"\nSpringer told the story of his uncles, Bob and Howard. Howard was a United States Army Ranger during the Second World War, while Bob served in the Army during the Korean War. Bob was able to rise to the rank of sergeant first class in three years, an impressive feat that would've taken years to achieve during peacetime, but he carried the scars of Korea with him for the rest of his life.\n\"Most of the family saw him as a larger than life man with a short fuse, a quick temper and a love of the drink,\" Springer explained.\nSpringer said that serving in the military and experiencing the challenges of military service gave him a different perspective on his Uncle Bob than the rest of his family had and that had he not served, he would've remembered his uncles very differently.\n\"I learned to not judge lest ye be judged, because when it came down to it, we were all needed by each other. I became a brother to those around me,\" Springer said, recounting his time in the Army. \"When someone needed me, their needs were met. When I needed something, others were always there for me. It instilled in myself a sense of community and belonging that I have never felt before nor since.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

GOTTO Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 888\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — A colorful, repurposed school travels about Kent County, stopping at various elementary schools to deliver not only their wonderfully imaginative series of children's novels, but some good, old-fashioned face time with the books' authors, Robbi Behr and Matthew Swanson of Chestertown.For several years now the entrepreneurial illustrator and writer pair have been quietly supporting the effort to provide better access to books for kids in Title I schools. With every school they visit, they have been winning kids over with a lively presentation that allows the children to imagine what it's like to be creators themselves.\nThis agency-invoking exercise would prove to be the catalyst that convinced the married couple to embark on their cross-county, \"Busload of Books Tour.\" The intent to visit one Title I school in every state over the course of a year was the direct result of the enthusiasm that kids and educators alike found in the approachable, friendly and totally immersive experience that Behr and Swanson provided.\nA team of educational researchers from Washington College was also assembled to compile the data necessary to ascertain relevant outcomes and impacts that will be used to assess and support the needs of Title I schools going forward.\nThe trip was chronicled daily by the pair via social media and by others who had the opportunity to see this presentation for themselves. And even though it is more than a year since they all got off the bus, narratives about this remarkable trip and its impacts on the communities of kids visited continues to make news on both the local and national level, with an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show and articles in both Forbes and People magazines, among many others.\nThroughout the 2024-2025 school year, the couple has continued their literacy initiative by planning to visit a total of 12 schools across the country; six in-person and six virtually.\nBehr and Swanson, who have a significant portion of their career portfolio anchored in the art of collaboration, have been regular speakers on the topic over the last decade, honing a particular blend of authentic communication skills and humor that resonate with their audiences. As a result, they have been recognized and supported by peers within their creative, collaborative sphere of influence, which has led to other opportunities to share what they know.\nEarlier in 2024, Swanson said, they received an interesting email from one such peer who felt they would be a thought-provoking addition to a roster of speakers at this year's Masters of Scale Conference held in San Francisco and sponsored by the podcast of the same name and its parent company, WaitWhat media properties.\nThe email, which was authored by company CEO, Jeff Berman, was a pitch for the couple to join a distinguished list of thought-leaders in their respective fields who would speak to the conference's theme which leans heavily in all things tech, with a focus this year on the advent of Artificial Intelligence, or AI.\n\"First of all, I was like, why do they want us to talk at this thing?\" Swanson said. \"From what we understood, it's like a tech conference and we are kind of like the most analog people with what we're doing. We're driving around in a bus giving out boxes of books.\"\nTo date, this would be the largest and most widely recognized conference at which the pair would speak, with notables such as American internet entrepreneur and venture capitalist, Reid Hoffman, the CEO of Chewy, Inc., Sumit Singh, former President Bill Clinton, and Wes Moore, governor of Maryland, scheduled to present.\n\"However, it totally made sense from the standpoint that Robbi and I have never fit in wherever we've gone,\" added Swanson. \"Our first big speaking gig was the International Illustrators Conference, when we had not published a single book. We were there because of our story being an inspiring sort of tale of entrepreneurship and outside-of-the-box thinking. And to that extent, being invited to Masters of Scale was the same thing. We had done something unexpected that people found inspiring and interesting and that they thought might serve as a model to others about how to look beyond the expected solutions.\"\nSo how would they take a presentation geared to elementary school kids and age it up for an adult audience?\n\"Really there's about 30 different stories, single stories you could tell, right? Behr conjectured. \"There's the story of the research, there's the story of the kids, there's the story of the teachers, there's stories of communities, there's the story of us driving around.\"\nThe result was an interactive, yet intimate chat with an audience of about 800 people that spoke to the genesis of their outreach, the challenges that Title I schools continue to face, family life on the road in that colorful bus, and the incredible partnerships forged from the very beginning.\nBy the time the winding tale of an adorable hippo named Jenny whose dream to own an ice cream shop was realized and then threatened by the evil, lactose-intolerant sun, there wasn't a dry eye in the house, as the audience whole-heartedly leaned into their exercise—their attention definitely captured.\nBehr and Swanson summarized their talk by relaying that in a sense, we all have the option to create a \"colorful school bus\" of sorts and drive it down a path of our choosing that represents a change for the better. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland conservatives make gains in school board races\n\n November 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Adam Hudacek Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1263\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Conservative school board candidates saw sweeping wins across Maryland this week, defying expectations in the largely blue state and solidifying the influence of the 1776 Project PAC, the Republican-aligned organization that endorsed 19 candidates statewide.In total, 11 of the political action committee's endorsed candidates either won or narrowly led their races as of Friday morning. Candidates backed by the PAC won control of the school boards in Somerset and Calvert counties, while appearing poised to win in Talbot County. Final results await the counting of some mail-in and provisional ballots, which must be counted by Nov. 15.\nCampaign finance records show that the Maryland State Education Association Fund for Children and Public Education — the political arm of the state's teachers union — spent $516,999.57 during the 2024 election cycle. And the 1776 Project PAC clearly sees the teachers' union as its defeated rival in the election.\n\"Even outspending us by $450,000, the teachers' union couldn't beat us in deep-blue Maryland—their message is just too extreme,\" said Stefano Forte, executive director of the 1776 Project PAC. \"Voters chose raising test scores and graduation rates over their far-left culture war. On Tuesday, common sense won, and that has no price tag.\"\nA fourth school district with candidates targeted for defeat by Democrats — Washington County — also flipped to conservative control without the aid of the 1776 Project PAC.\nOf those 11 winners endorsed by that conservative PAC, six had also been targeted for defeat by the Maryland Democratic Party, which selected 24 \"extreme\" conservative school board candidates in the state to directly invest against — a move the party referred to as \"unprecedented.\" Of those 24, only nine have been lost thus far. The remaining 15 all won or are leading their respective races.\n\"We are proud that we pushed out some of the most extreme elements in these races,\" said Luca Amayo, spokesperson for the Maryland Democratic Party. \"It's clear, however, that we must continue to bolster our grassroots efforts and make Marylanders aware of the far-right agenda encroaching into Maryland's public schools, especially as they are emboldened under a Donald Trump presidency.\"\nThe party considers the 1776 Project PAC a \"radical ring-wing group,\" and helped defeat five of its endorsed candidates from winning office. Ryan James Girdusky, the committee's founder, wrote on the PAC's website that he created the organization \"to change public education by reforming school boards and electing reform-minded conservatives who wanted to improve public education in this country.\"\nAs of Oct. 16, the PAC had pumped $90,580.50 toward the campaigns of 13 candidates across Cecil, Queen Anne's, Talbot, Calvert, Somerset and St. Mary's counties.\nIn Calvert County, candidates endorsed by the 1776 Project PAC won all three school board seats.\nRetired principal Mike Shisler lost his bid for the board. He said he fears that the new conservative leadership, all of whom were targeted by the state's Democratic Party as well, would create inequity and fear within the county's education system.\n\"I'm very disappointed in the results,\" Shisler said Wednesday, \"It's not going to be inclusive of everybody. It's going to target folks. It's going to try to undo the work of previous boards of education when it came to stressing equity and diversity, and I think they're trying to roll back the clock.\"\nJoseph Marchio, who defeated Shisler, said he expected a close race going into Tuesday night. His margin was the closest of the three 1776 Project PAC-backed victors in Calvert County.\nIn Washington County, on the state's panhandle, all four candidates that Democrats targeted for defeat won their election, flipping the county's school board into conservative control. All three non-targeted incumbents lost reelection, while April Ann Zentmeyer, the only targeted incumbent, defended hers.\n\"I look forward to working with new board members and faithful colleagues to maximize opportunities for students, faculty, staff, and parents; and to identify solutions that will strengthen WCPS,\" Zentmeyer said in a statement.\nWashington County has a county-wide school board election process, as opposed to the school districts where candidates are elected by district. Instead of one-on-one races, all school board candidates in Washington County face each other in a crowded pool, with the top four vote-getting candidates winning seats. Carroll, Allegany and Frederick counties have similar systems.\nThe success of conservative school board candidates around Maryland reflects a larger trend from this year's election cycle: the state's rightward shift. According to data from the Associated Press, every county in Maryland shifted rightward this year compared to the 2020 election — from two points in Charles County and Baltimore City to eight points in Cecil County.\nSome races remain too close to call. In Frederick County, two conservative candidates targeted by Democrats led the race for three seats as of Friday, but two other candidates trailed close behind. Talbot County, which flipped conservative this cycle, saw two 1776 Project PAC-endorsed candidates win seats, while a third trailed by a narrow margin as of Friday with votes still left to tally.\nSomerset County, the third district flipped by 1776 Project PAC-endorsed contenders, saw massive margins of victory for the conservatives, with Mary Beth Bozman securing about four-fifths of the vote in her race. Her opponent was Alverne \"Chet\" Chesterfield — who, the Local News Network reported last month, had a peace order initiated against him in 2022.\nThe Local News Network also reported that Brandie Edelen, a 1776 Project PAC-endorsed candidate in St. Mary's County, had a state tax lien filed against her in 2019. Edelen handily lost her race to Josh Guy.\nIn deep-blue Howard County, Andrea Chamblee is in a tight race with Trent Kittleman, an early supporter of the county's Moms for Liberty chapter. Even though Democrat Kamala Harris carried over two-thirds of the votes cast in the presidential race in the county, Chamblee led Kittleman by only 3.5 points as of Friday morning.\nMail-in and provisional ballots, which have leaned in favor of Chamblee this far, are still being counted.\nThe founder of Moms for Liberty in Frederick County, Jaime Brennan, appeared headed to victory. She said that despite the Maryland Democrats' campaign against her and Colt Black, the other conservative in the race, that effort didn't appear to be all that effective.\n\"They spent a lot of money in opposition to me and Colt, and to prop up the other side, but I didn't hear from a single person who said, 'Oh, I heard about this and I'm not voting for you,'\" Brennan said.\nIn neighboring Carroll County, where Moms For Liberty lobbied for the removal of 60 books from school libraries — 21 permanently — conservative candidates secured their hold on the board. Greg Malveaux and Kristen Zihmer defeated Amanda Jozkowski and Muri Lynn Dueppen, who together ran an underdog progressive campaign called the Slate for Student Success, which was endorsed by the Carroll County Educators Association.\n\"It's really a shame that a lot of voters in our county chose to kind of take their marching orders from their political party, rather than considering the opinions of the educators,\" Jozkowski said. She previously ran and lost in 2022.\nJozkowski said the race was a reflection of the national results, which saw an overwhelming rightward shift in nearly every state and in many down-ballot races. Malveaux and Zihmer were both targeted by the Maryland Democrats.\nThat rightward shift could also be seen in the school board race in Anne Arundel County's District 3. There, the conservative candidate, Chuck Yocum, fell only 2.76 points behind his opponent, Erica McFarland, despite weeks of controversy over Yocum's 1994 acquittal on child sexual abuse and perverted practices charges.\nLocal News Network reporters Sasha Allen, Marwa Barakat, Ela Jalil, Colin McNamara and Tolu Talabi contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — The Talbot County Free Library, St. Michaels Branch has opened its temporary location at the St. Michaels Village Shopping Center on Talbot Street. To celebrate the grand opening, the library provided free coffee, craft bags and donuts for all visitors on Tuesday morning.The Talbot Free Library on Fremont Street is currently undergoing construction for its building expansion. The temporary location, at the site of the former St. Michaels YMCA, will serve residents of St. Michaels until the expansion is complete.\nShauna Beulah, branch manager for the library, said construction at the Fremont location will take about a year to 18 months.\n\"A full service library will offer all of the services we had there, a Xerox machine, children's area with all the different kinds of materials they had, and audio books and DVDs, new books, all of those things,\" Beulah said.\nBeulah said the location of the temporary library was important because it needed to be accessible and a familiar space for residents to visit.\nThough it is a full-service library, there are some amenities the temporary location does not provide, including meeting rooms and an external book drop, so books will need to be returned during open hours.\nBut Beulah said the wait would be worth the vast renovation expected at the Fremont location. Renovations include an eating area, social computer rooms, a quiet reading section and a multi-purpose section for all.\nDiana Hastings, youth services librarian, said the first few families who visit the new library will get a fall bag with fun crafts for all ages to encourage creativity and family-based activities.\nHastings, who is also an art therapist, said she tries to provide hands-on crafts and activities to young readers to create and explore and prepare for their journey into literacy.\nThough the temporary library is a smaller space, Hastings said it provides an extensive array of youth books, including bilingual children's book, fiction, non-fiction chapter books, vox books (live print audio books) and recorded storybooks. If a book is not available at the library, librarians can order it from a different library.\nThis way efforts are made for residents to still have access to the information they need.\n\"We hope that families take advantage of coming here, utilizing our resources, and we welcome them,\" Hastings said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Districts 2, 5 and 6 were on the ballot in the November election.\nFor district 2, O'Connor won with 52.7% of the vote, according to the State Board of Elections, beating out incumbent Board Member Candace Henry. O'Connor said her campaign provided the opportunity for her to get a better understanding of leading a campaign, school board responsibilities and Blueprint, Maryland's 10-year plan to improve the state's education system.\nO'Connor said she has just skimmed the surface and is ready to learn more.\nShe said she will be prioritizing academics and discipline. With academics, she said she would like to see elementary students reading every night and working on more book reports, and for schools to provide summer reading lists.\nFor discipline, O'Connor said she has noticed a lack of consistency, or \"different rules for different people.\"\n\"We need a plan for all the schools that this is the way we're going to, you know, this is the dress, this is the behavior when you walk in the building. If you veer from that, there's going to be this consequence, and you got to, I mean, it's the follow through,\" she said.\nFor District 5, Karla Wieland-Cherry won with 54.6% votes, according to the State Board of Elections. Wieland-Cherry, who defeated incumbent Board Member Anna Howie, said she appreciated the support she received from her campaign, though she did mention she \"got a lot of negativity.\" She hopes she can work through any negative sentiments to have a productive four years on the board.\nWieland-Cherry said she will be prioritizing open communication for everyone she works with and promoting the Career and Technology Education Program, which offers job training in various fields.\nShe said it's important to encourage kids to look at career alternatives for those not interested in college, whether that be training to become a firefighter, plumber or welder.\n\"I think (the CTE program is) under encouraged, under utilized,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"And that's where jobs are.\"\nFor District 6, Jurrius won with 51.9% of the vote, defeating Kerry Gunshenan, according to the State Board of Elections. Current District 6 Board Member Mary Wheeler did not seek reelection.\nJurrius did not answer calls from reporters in time for publication. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Student-parents need support from colleges\n\n November 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE MUNOZ | Section: Columns \n \n 711\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After my daughter's mom left when she was an infant, I raised her as a single father while I went to college. As a first-generation student, higher education was my hope for a better future for both of us.Like so many student-parents, I faced numerous obstacles including housing and food insecurity and a lack of affordable child care. I know what it's like when you can't pay for books, food or a place to live. Beyond the scarcity of physical resources, I felt like I didn't fit in.\nIt's not uncommon for student-parents to feel hopeless and isolated on campus. As president of Long Beach City College, it is my personal and professional mission to make sure all students who come to our campus feel a sense of belonging.\nAcross the nation, one in five college students are parents. In addition to attending college, student parents engage with multiple sectors including early childhood education, K-12, the labor market and social safety net programs. Together, we must do more to ensure student parents have the support they need to achieve the aspirations they have for themselves and their families.\nAccording to Long Beach Community College data, the majority of our student-parents are mothers of color who are 25 years of age or older and facing financial disadvantages. The majority of our student-parents also identify as single.\nWhen I look back on my own experience, I remember single mothers telling me I was in a position of privilege because I am a dad. I stood out as a single parent, and they saw that people wanted to help me. While research on student fathers is scarce, one study shows that student fathers are indeed more likely to receive help than student mothers.\nI believe that being a student-parent is challenging no matter how you identify, but single mothers deal with a unique level of stigma.\nWhen I arrived at Long Beach Community College as vice president of student services, I noticed signs with a stroller and a bar through it saying \"No children allowed.\" We got that changed immediately. That wasn't the message we wanted to send. At the college, we want student-parents to know they are appreciated here, and so are their children.\nIn addition to the Child Development Center for children ages 2-5, student-parents can also access cost-free after-school care for children ages 6-18 through the Viking Clubhouse, in partnership with the Boys & Girls Club of Long Beach. We also offer a CalWORKs (California Work Opportunity and Responsibility for Kids) program to assist student parents with education, training and job skills. One of the programs that I'm most excited about involves our partnership with Raise The Barr. Through this partnership, single parent students and their families can access affordable child care and housing.\nWe are making progress, but we have more hard work ahead. Culture change takes time, and we need to continually hold ourselves accountable. A recent survey revealed that more than half of the student-parents on our campus do not know about the resources available to them. We cannot expect student-parents, who are already more likely to face time poverty, to spend hours researching where to find help and navigating disparate processes.\nAs we strive to improve, we're engaging other partners in this important work. We are one of four community colleges selected for Ascend at the Aspen Institute's Postsecondary Leadership Circle Activation Fund. Through our partnership with Ascend, we are driving two key strategies forward.\nThe first involves streamlining resources so that student-parents can more easily access services and programs. Our team is in the process of creating a one-stop shop for housing, food, child care, mental health, academic supports and more. The next strategy involves an outreach campaign to make sure students know about available services.\nBy nurturing our student-parents through degree completion or through the transfer process to a four-year university, we are creating opportunities for one generation to the next. Student-parents model hard work and commitment for their children. Today, my daughter is a community college professor, and I couldn't be prouder.\nBeyond providing the very best for their families, student-parents have much to contribute to their campuses and their communities. When these dedicated caregivers succeed, it is a win for us all, and that's why we must continue to dedicate ourselves to their victory. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland schools get new rules for shooter drills\n\n November 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARISSA YELENIK Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 809\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Active shooter drills in Maryland schools will be different next school year under a new set of state guidelines meant to limit the impact those drills have on the mental health of students.The new guidelines prohibit trauma-inducing elements like imitation of gunfire or explosions. They also require school systems to notify parents in advance when students will be practicing what to do in the event of an active shooter in their buildings.\nThe new guidelines were released by the Maryland Center for School Safety this fall, ordered by a new state law requiring them to draft new parameters and create a new process for collecting and analyzing data on their effectiveness. The center will also look into the psychological impact the shooter drills have on staff, parents and students.\nParts of the guidelines — including bans on gunfire and the requirement to notify parents — have already gone into effect because they are part of state law. The full set of guidelines will be put into effect at the beginning of the academic year in 2025.\n\"The mental health crisis that we see in our young people is undeniable,\" said Del. Jared Solomon, who sponsored the measure in the Maryland House of Delegates earlier this year. \"As we normalize having to deal with school shootings, we are creating more anxiety and more issues among young people.\"\nWhile schools have long practiced safety drills, active shooter drills are relatively new, following the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School, according to the guidelines.\nSchool systems have made an effort to keep students safe by implementing active shooter drills, however, concerns have been raised across the country about the impact these drills have on student's mental health. This led to the April passage of the Maryland bill, as well as an executive order signed by President Joe Biden to increase federal guidance on the subject.\nMaryland's new guidelines, released in October, call for unified terminology between districts to discourage miscommunication between the school system and the relevant public. They intend to increase communication between staff and students to create an open dialogue where everyone feels comfortable raising concerns, as well as creating a diverse planning team who will work on planning the drills and doing a post-analysis of how it went and any shortcomings it faced.\nThe guidelines emphasize that active shooter drills are not a one-size-fits-all matter, and should be adjusted to fit the age group.\n\"These are going to be part of a young person's life for the foreseeable future, but that doesn't mean that you can't do them in a way that is both trauma-informed and age-appropriate,\" said Solomon. \"It's really important that the way school systems do these types of events reflects a care and age appropriateness of the grades that are being impacted.\"\nThe guidelines also recommend that a mechanism be established to pause or stop the drill when necessary, for schools to notify parents before and after all drills to increase trust and communication and to allow students and staff who feel uncomfortable to opt-out from the drills.\nThe Maryland General Assembly sponsors of the bill, Solomon and Sen. Cheryl Kagan, felt that the impact guns have on today's children needs to be mitigated as much as possible, and worked to balance a focus on their safety while prioritizing their mental health.\n\"The law that Del. Solomon and I sponsored and passed tried to walk the fine line of thoughtful preparation that isn't traumatic,\" Kagan said. \"And we also had to consider parents and community members who are understandably alarmed and concerned when they see the impact of these drills … Our concern was that [the drills] were not being strategic in how they were handled, and were actually causing trauma for those involved.\"\nOne active shooter drill that occurred in Solomon's district served as a driving force for his involvement.\n\"Families were literally getting texts from their kids saying 'I don't know if I'll ever see you again' and it was a drill. They didn't know,\" said Solomon. \"There was no requirement prior to this for a school or a school system to notify families before or after.\"\nAdditional drivers for the bill included shared experiences from other parents Solomon spoke to, he said. Many shared frustrations at the lack of foresight they had into when the drills would be taking place and what would happen during them, preventing them from having appropriate conversations with their children to prepare them.\nStarting in January, schools will distribute a new survey made by the National Center for School Mental Health to gather feedback from staff, parents and students on how effective the drills are, and the mental impact they have on all involved.\n\"The goal is not to create fear but to instill confidence and preparedness,\" the Maryland Center for School Safety said in their guidelines. \"By working together as a community, schools can foster safe and supportive learning environments.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A dozen Kent Island High School Honor Society student coaches also lend a hand in serving as role models to younger students.\nCrediting Queen Anne's County Public Schools as a fantastic partner, Ray thanked the initiatives' Advisory Board, the county commissioners, and QACPS for collaborative support.\nWith well over 20 years of providing assisting students, the community came together unofficially in 1999 to consider an initiative to support county students in the wake of the Columbine tragedy, before officially forming the character focused resource initiative in the fall of 2000, according to Committee Co-Chair Wayne Humphries.\n\"Its been a very exciting and very quick time,\" Humphries said, and credited phenomenal teams of volunteers and the support of the community to ensure the continuation of the legacy.\nOver the decades it is estimated Character Counts has reached a total of between 70,000 and 100,000 students, he said.\n\"Its hard to believe in a county our size, but in 25 years it adds up,\" Humphries said.\nPresenting an official anniversary proclamation, County Commissioner and former Character Counts Coach Phil Dumenil remembered the organization's 12th anniversary and the graduating students at the time who had been with the program since its inception.\n\"It's obviously a brilliant program,\" Dumenil said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Three new members will be sworn in next month.\n\"Your guidance and direction as board members has strengthened the bond between our community and our schools,\" Pepukayi said.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said the three outgoing members were crucial to the Board of Education's work to improve education in the county.\n\"That (work) is quietly often led by these three, which maybe you aren't aware of in the community. But I'm telling you tonight,\" Jackson said. \"We are going to be cut down at the knees. We will grow back. But we are losing three incredibly important and valuable resources.\"\nWheeler, the outgoing District 6 representative who opted not to run for reelection, served on the board for 7.5 years. Cynthia Jurrius will assume Wheeler's seat after defeating Kerry Gunshenan in this month's election.\nBoard Member Amy Dodson said she will miss Wheeler's \"pragmatism\" and \"common sense.\"\n\"I hope that I've done some good for the kids in Talbot County Public Schools. If I didn't, I know I tried,\" Wheeler said. \" … Cynthia, the person who's taking my place, is here tonight. I so enjoy your enthusiasm.

The outgoing vice president is the director of Salisbury University's Disability Resource Center.\nJackson said she's \"so proud of the work\" she accomplished alongside Henry, who has often spearheaded special education and accessibility efforts carried out by the board.\n\"As I step away from this role, I encourage you all to stay focused on what truly matters — every student, and I mean every student,\" Henry said. \"Don't let individual agendas divide you or distract you from the essential work of seeing that every student is seen as valuable and worthy of our full support.\"\n\"I wish better for our community,\" she continued, \"but now I get to just hold people accountable from another seat, and that's exactly what I plan to do.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As part of this recognition, nearly 50 students from Kent Island High School had the incredible opportunity to attend the Ravens game against the Washington Commanders and be celebrated for their contributions.\"The Interact Club, led by [teacher Lacey] Phelps has been doing remarkable work to support leadership development,\" Principal Dan Harding said, \"under the guidance of Katie McGrath and in partnership with the Giving the Edge Foundation, run by Bobby Woolley and Colleen Williams. This partnership and the outstanding leadership opportunities it has provided for our students were recently recognized in a big way.\"\nWilliams shared their organization, Giving The Edge Foundation, was the winning recipient of the \"Honor Rows\" Program with the Baltimore Ravens, a program salutes youth groups that provide outstanding service to their communities. Honorees are selected by a panel of youth service leaders with the assistance of the Baltimore Ravens, the Governor's Office on Service and Volunteerism and M&T Bank staff. This year, The Edge nominated the Interact Club and Leadership Cohort at Kent Island High School.\nThe Leadership Cohort started in the spring of 2021 at Kent Island High School by the Giving The Edge Foundation, led by McGrath. The Foundation seeks grants to help support the program and is fully-funded by the Foundation, explained Williams.\nLeadership Cohort allows student leaders to understand their \"WHY.\" Over the years the program has grown from a handful of students to over 40+ students who voluntarily meet before school to talk about who they are, what drives their passion, and they even take a personality test. Last year an Interact portion in partnership with the Rotary of Kent Island was launched to encompass a service above self-component. This school year the Interact Club has over 70 students ready to serve and give back to their community.\nAt the game, the students were welcomed at the Honor Row tent where everyone received a t-shirt and ticket to the game, including VIP access where they were escorted down on the field for pictures and a chance to meet players during warm-ups. While on the field Giving The Edge Foundation was awarded a Governor's Citation for the State of Maryland. The Honor Row was also recognized on the jumbotron during the second quarter.\nTo support their mission or learn more visit https://www.theedge360.net/gtef \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Although board members did not comment on the decision to terminate the contract at the meeting, board member Chris Wheedleton said in an email that the actions the board took were in support of Thompson's recommendations to \"equip\" educators with the best resources to \"get the best possible outcomes for our kids and our community.\"\n\"The board is working to encourage and support Dr. Thompson's plans to continuously review and refine the best approaches possible to create the best conditions for each of our students to thrive academically,\" Wheedleton said in the email.\nFour months earlier, the board voted to terminate its more than three-year contract with an alternative education program for high schoolers that would have cost the district over $3.3 million. The program had been met with criticism from residents since the contract for it was approved in September 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said families are moving out of the district because they're concerned about sending their kids to Sandy Hill.\n\"Our school is old and falling apart,\" she said.\nMcGowan brought up plumbing issues in bathrooms, issues with the building's room temperatures and the difficulties of having to teach and learn in open concept classrooms. Other teachers brought up mold problems and critters and bugs getting into the building.\n\"There's organic growth in the building,\" Sandy Hill teacher Christy Starling said. \"Just two years ago, we had to push back our availability to enter the building prior to school starting due to massive mold infestation that had to be treated within a month before school started.\"\nAs part of the consent agenda passed during the meeting, the board voted in favor of having architecture firm Hord Coplan Macht do an ed specifications and feasibility study for the district's oldest elementary schools, including Sandy Hill.\nThe ed specifications and feasibility study is being funded by Maryland's Interagency Commission on School Construction. The IAC is also allocating money for school capital improvement projects in the county once the study has been completed.\nDuring a Board of Education work session in October, board members heard from the IAC on the different programs it operates and its projected budget allocations to Dorchester County.\nFor fiscal year 2026, the IAC estimates $2.75 million of its Capital Improvement Program will be allocated to Dorchester County, with a state cost share of 98%. The IAC'S Built To Learn Program, a temporary program created to hand out project-specific grants across the state, has $3.9 million budgeted for Dorchester County. Those funds need to be spent by 2031.\nAt the meeting Thursday, Assistant Superintendent of Administrative Services Michael Collins said it is important that the district moves forward with the ed specifications and feasibility study quickly because the IAC funding for it needs to be encumbered by the end of the year.\n\"We want to get this phase done so we can make big decisions on our old elementary schools,\" he said.\nCollins said the ed speculations process will take six months. He said a committee will work with the community to get an idea of what the ideal Dorchester County elementary school looks like. The feasibility study, he said, will determine what makes the most sense for each of the schools included.\n\"The feasibility study basically looks at each school and says, is it feasible to either renovate this school, replace this school or combine this school in order to make it fit with the ed spec?\" Collins said.\nOnce this process is complete, the district will be able to bid out capital improvement projects. Collins estimated it will take about a year to complete the studies.\nAt the end of the meeting, board member Talibah Chikwendu told the Sandy Hill teachers that she is sorry it will \"take so long\" to build a school.\n\"Because even though the things are in place for us to actually get a large amount of that money to get it done, the process takes a very long time,\" she said. \"I am sorry that you will have to continue to work in those conditions while we do so.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's a whole lot of fun. Eating, eating, eating,\" said Maisuh, who is pursuing a doctorate in economics at the University of Delaware.\n\"I feel like over here in America, everybody is like time-constrained, so it's an opportunity for families to come together and friends to come together and share and make merry,\" she added.\nOn Sunday, Maisuh was one of 500 international students and their family members who took part in the annual Thanksgiving dinner sponsored by UD's Center for Global Programs & Services. They gathered at the Trabant University Center and were treated to a full turkey dinner with all the fixings, plus pumpkin pie for dessert.\nThe event is a way to introduce international students to an American tradition, said Vina Titaley, associate director for international student engagement and success.\n\"It's an opportunity for students who have never experienced a Thanksgiving holiday to experience a Thanksgiving holiday,\" Titaley said. \"But also it's a way of building community amongst our international students.\"\nEach year, UD welcomes nearly 4,000 international students and visiting scholars representing 100 countries.\nDuring Thanksgiving week, the campus shuts down and most students head home to spend the holiday with family and friends. However, international students, for whom home is an ocean away, often stay on campus. The annual dinner at Trabant gives those students a place to celebrate the holiday and feel included.\n\"This event is extremely important from a sense of creating belonging and really telling our students that they matter,\" said Ravi Ammigan, associate provost for international programs. \"We are grateful to have such a large, diverse international student community on our campus.\"\nAmmigan is from Mauritius and still remembers his first American Thanksgiving nearly three decades ago. He was attending college in Chicago, and a professor invited him and other students over for dinner.\n\"It was new, but very impactful. I felt that I belonged, because when the campus was empty, I had a place to go,\" he recalled. \"And I think tonight, these students feel exactly the same way. They feel that this campus, this community, this university, cares. And we truly do.\"\nThe Center for Global Programs & Services started hosting a Thanksgiving dinner 11 years ago, with approximately 40 people attending. It has since grown into a signature event that students look forward to each year.\n\"We're all here, of course, to celebrate Thanksgiving,\" Ammigan said. \"But I think it's much more than that. It's to celebrate cultures around the world. It's to have gratitude for friendship and being able to be together in a learning environment like what the University of Delaware is.\"\nTitaley, who is originally from Indonesia, said many students are excited to try new foods.\n\"Turkey really is the highlight for a lot of students because turkey is kind of like a big icon for Thanksgiving,\" she said, adding that many students end up discovering that the side dishes are as delicious, if not more, than the turkey itself.\nNeha Sindhu, a native of India who is pursuing a doctorate in bioinformatics, said her favorite Thanksgiving food is pumpkin pie. She said she enjoys getting to experience Thanksgiving because it provides a slice of American culture.\n\"It feels like we belong here in this culture, in this country,\" Sindhu said. \"It feels good to have someone tell us that.\"\nFaith Wanjiku, from Kenya, is experiencing her first Thanksgiving. She came to UD 11 months ago to earn a master's degree in bioinformatics.\nShe said she was most looking forward to trying turkey.\n\"This event is very important because most of us cannot go home, so it's a good way to come together and meet with other people and give thanks to be here,\" Wanjiku said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline Commissioners hear update on potential for new middle school\n\n November 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 560\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — The Caroline County Commissioners were given an update Tuesday morning on potential plans for a new middle school in the county.Bill Mengel, director of operations at Caroline County Public Schools, presented a revised fiscal year 2026 capital improvement plan to the commission. That improvement plan includes a priority item of year one and year two funding for a potential new middle school building.\nMengel noted that while the district was in the \"talking phase\" in August and September, it has \"transitioned into the planning phase.\" This will soon include working with a consultant and eventually procuring a feasibility study, which may be complete in around six to eight months, Mengel said.\n\"One thing I've learned about building a new school is that it's a very serious endeavor,\" he said. \"It takes a very long time to build one, approximately five years. But things change very, very quickly. That's really what kind of happened here, early October.\"\nCurrently, Colonel Richardson Middle School in Federalsburg and Lockerman Middle School in Denton serve as the district's two middle schools. It is unclear if the district will aim to build an entire new school, renovate, or add on. Mengel said those outcomes are largely dependent on the feasibility study's recommendation and the Board of Education's subsequent approval or denial.\nThe revised capital improvement plan was unanimously approved by the three commissioners Tuesday. Its top priority requests are $500,000 for HVAC work at Denton Elementary School and $5.5 million in early planning and design costs for a new or expanded middle school over the next two fiscal years.\n$76 million in requested funding from the state for a new middle school build is listed next on the form. Mengel said that $76 million in requested state funding is around 89% of the total $86 million estimation for years one and two, meaning the county would be responsible for around 11% of the funding.\nMaryland's Interagency Commission on School Construction, which the funding form will be submitted to, is looking at an approximate capacity of 126,000 square feet for a potential new build, according to Mengel. Mengel said the district's main point of negotiation is \"How do we get more square footage?\"\nCost per square foot has risen sharply year to year, the director of operations noted.\n\"If we get shovels in the ground in FY28 and we're able to move in for FY30 school year, that could be at or north of $490 per square foot,\" Mengel said. \"So that's the driver.\"\nCommission President Travis Breeding asked that the school district keep the county updated on the early planning and feasibility study results.\n\"Keep us in the loop on the study, because we would like to, if we're on the hook for 11% of this, we'd like to have input into, is it a renovation, addition, new location, all those discussions,\" Breeding said.\nMengel said he doesn't want work to begin on a large capital project if it's not set to accommodate increases in student population.\n\"I am aware, and so is the Board of Education, that there are some communities that are planned in and around Denton and points north (in) Caroline County,\" Mengel said. \"We expect that there will be some students moving in impacting our populations. The last thing I want to do a build such as this, and then have it be at 100% occupancy within a couple of years.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — Four St. Michaels residents are going out of their way to provide local students with hygiene supplies. They have donated products including dental floss, toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouthwash, deodorant, feminine hygiene products and soap.In collaboration with St. Michaels Middle/High School, this group is working to ensure students can focus on their studies without worrying about basic needs.\nThe initiative began in September when Kevin and Marybeth Sullivan attempted to make a donation for a back-to-school event hosted by the police station and Christ Church for the Smile Program. The Sullivans were told that the church had all the supplies it needed for the school year.\nWanting to put their donations to good use, they reached out to St. Michaels Commissioner Jay Hudson for an alternative way to help students. Hudson talked with a guidance counselor at the school, who said they were in need of hygiene supplies from pads and tampons to deodorant.\nHudson contacted fellow Commissioner Katrina Whittington. Together they used the Sullivan's funds to buy basic essentials for the St. Michaels students.\n\"There's so many ways in middle school and high school that you can get embarrassed, but it's not something you think about,\" Kevin Sullivan said. \"But what happens if a young woman goes into her period or something, … They either come from a family that can't afford it, or they're just unprepared for it.\"\nFor Hudson, the connection between a child's self-esteem and their academic achievement is incredibly important.\n\"I think self esteem and quality of life being the real undercurrent of this whole kind of idea,\" Hudson said. \"It kind of pours over because if they're comfortable in their skin and they're confident in their behaviors, then they're definitely going to have the opportunity to be more successful scholastically.\"\nHudson said any student needing hygiene items can reach out to Rebecca Mielke-Mann, assistant principal at St. Michaels Middle/High School, who is holding all the ready-to-use supplies.\nMielke-Mann said the donations have a significant impact on the school because they removes barriers to student success.\n\"When students have access to basic hygiene items, they can focus more on their education and less on personal insecurities or distractions,\" Mielke-Mann said. \"It helps create a more inclusive, positive learning environment and demonstrates to our students that their community cares about their well-being.\"\nMielke-Mann said particularly accessible hygiene products for girls are critical for ensuring that they can attend school confidently and consistently. According to Mielke-Mann, a lack of these items can lead to missed school days, distractions or discomfort, which can impact academic performance and self-esteem.\nBy providing these essentials, they're helping to level the playing field, Mielke-Mann said.\nAlthough there was no official plan for the duration of the program, Whittington said if funds are running low she would kick in money to replenish the supplies.\nThe Sullivans and Hudson agreed they would do the same. According to Hudson, the supplies have been well received by students, and Whittington and Hudson will be refilling some of the more used items.\nMarybeth Sullivan encourages anyone who has the inclination to support students to work with their local schools and see what needs aren't being met.\n\"I feel that most people really want to try to reach out and help other people,\" Marybeth Sullivan said. \"I don't think it's a unique thing by any means. So if they know the need, then I think they're happy to try to help.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It's also one of goals of Feed The People, a local food access program through Four Eleven Kitchen.\nKidd said that through Feed The People, Four Eleven Kitchen aims to feed bellies and feed minds.\nFeeding minds entails getting people into the kitchen to learn cooking skills and gather accessible recipe ideas. It entails farm-to-table education, which Four Eleven Kitchen is working on a curriculum for.\n\"We are developing partnerships and relationships that will allow us to create a curriculum and resources for the local community that desires to be first-generational farmers,\" she said.\nThe nonprofit is working with the City of Cambridge and Habitat for Humanity to turn two parcels at Douglas Street and Lincoln Terrace in Cambridge into an urban \"learning\" farm.\n\"The community will be able to go, and they'll be able to tend to the farm,\" she said. \"But while they're tending to the farm, they're learning skills, and they're learning how to then go back and implement it.\"\nThese programs are aimed at targeting what Kidd called \"a starvation of knowledge and education.\"\nOmeaka Jackson, a Four Eleven Kitchen board member, pointed at the small number of grocery stores in Dorchester County.\n\"I think having a program where we talk about nutrition (and make) sure people have access to food and things like that, I just think that's something that's important in all communities, but definitely Dorchester,\" she said.\nWhen it comes to feeding bellies, one of the group's goals is to bring back those community suppers that Kidd started with a group of people in 2016. Kidd said the suppers fell off with the pandemic, so they are starting from scratch.\nThe hope, Kidd said, is to revamp and relaunch the suppers in 2025. She said that she and the other community members involved had a long-term vision that she hopes she can carry out with Four Eleven Kitchen.\nThe suppers brought together an array of members from the community, Kidd said.\n\"It didn't matter if you made $5 a day or $500 a day,\" she said. \"Everyone could come and eat.\"\nJackson said the suppers helped facilitate family conversations around the dinner table.\nKidd remembers hearing a single mom at one of the suppers talk about what a relief it was to be able to sit at the table with her kids and not worry about preparing the food or cleaning dishes.\n\"And then they got to have other conversations with adults while watching their kids eat and not being isolated,\" Kidd said. \"And so what I saw was ... that experience was offering the sense of family and community.\"\nIn September, Four Eleven Kitchen opened its doors to their shared kitchen at the Packing House in Cambridge. Along with having the kitchen space, the nonprofit considers itself a food incubator hub. From cooking classes to tastings, the organization aims to connect with the community regarding all things food.\nJackson said she is \"super proud\" of Kidd for what she has accomplished.\n\"She has tenacity and a vision that anything is possible as long as you set your mind and heart to it,\" Jackson said.\nThere are multiple ways for people to support the nonprofit, including becoming a \"Foodie Friend.\" In return for monetary donations, Foodie Friends will get access to a library and resource hub that Four Eleven Kitchen is developing. Proceeds from Foodie Friends go directly to the Feed The People program.\nAlong with that, there are corporate Foodie Friends opportunities where donations go toward the nonprofit's overall operation.\nFor Kidd, when it comes to the Feed The People program, it's all about addressing the dire — although sometimes invisible — issue of hunger.

    "date": "2024-11-30",
    "author": "BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library",
    "content": "That which brings us together at the library\n\n November 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 889\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Back in September, I attended a lecture at the library given by Meg Daley Olmert, entitled \"Sit, Stay, Heal.\" Olmert is a writer who has worked on documentaries for Smithsonian World, National Geographic Explorer, and PBS, among others. In 1992 she was asked to join a research team studying the neurobiology of social bonding.Listening to Olmert speak, it became obvious that her work on that study changed her view of history; and I began to think it might change mine as well. So I picked up a copy of Olmert's book on the subject, \"Made for Each Other,\" rushed home and devoured it.\nI have referred to Jared Diamond's \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\" before in this column. That book's thesis, that geography rather than racial superiority gave Western Civilization a leg-up on the rest of the world, is now the lens through which I view and understand the past.\nBut if Diamond's book posits geography as history's fulcrum, Olmert's work places an even less obvious entity at that pivot point: a simple molecule, oxytocin.\nOxytocin is often referred to as the \"love hormone.\" All mammals produce it, and in all mammals it produces the same effects.\nWhen it's time to give birth, oxytocin brings on labor. When it's time to suckle our young, oxytocin brings on lactation. When animals groom one another — whether it's a ewe licking her lamb or a man helping his wife with a zipper — oxytocin is released and all concerned feel a rush of goodwill.\nOxytocin boosts trust, empathy, fidelity and nonverbal communication; it encourages and solidifies social bonding.\nAll of this is well known, but what Olmert's book makes clear is that these benefits are interspecific, that is: the effects are the same whether a woman is straightening her husband's tie or removing a thorn from her cat's paw. In both cases, their health improves and their bond is strengthened.\nFor years it has been received wisdom among archaeologists that humans created their first permanent settlements around 10,000 years ago, with the advent of agriculture. But recent discoveries have pushed that date back to a point 15,000 years before people began cultivating crops. Why then?\nWell, it turns out that the earlier date dovetails nicely with humanity's first successful domestication of a wild animal; the wolf became a dog, oxytocin was released, and the bond between man and man's best friend was created. People could now go to sleep in the same place night after night secure in the knowledge that their dogs would alert them if a saber-toothed cat or an enemy band approached their settlement.\nIf permanent settlement is the necessary first-step toward civilization, then we can thank Fido for Chartres Cathedral and the great pyramids. But before those piles could be erected, oxytocin still had more tasks to perform.\nWhen Homo sapiens first entered Europe, among the megafauna they encountered was a monster that stood six feet tall at the shoulder and sported eight-foot horns: the aurochs. When Caesar saw his first aurochs in Germany, he declared them too vicious to ever be tamed. The general would have been surprised to learn that the cattle marching placidly along in his army's wake were, in fact, descendants of the first domesticated aurochs.\nBut let's think for a moment about how that animal's vastly significant domestication first took place.\nImagine the courage it took for some Neolithic man or woman to approach a wild aurochs, corral it and slip a rope over its neck. Olmert makes the case that this person, whoever they were, was the test pilot of their day, that their one small step toward an aurochs represented a greater leap in world history than Neil Armstrong's. And it was successful, almost certainly, thanks to the oxytocin released in both man and beast.\nIf oxytocin helped create the bonds between people and animals that made civilization possible (think horses, camels, sheep, dogs, cattle, pigs, etc.), then Olmert's book closes with a cautionary note about what a deficit of oxytocin might mean for our modern world.\nSince the Industrial Revolution, people have been moving in ever greater numbers away from the animals that fueled civilization's development. Today, so few Americans still live on the land that the Census Bureau no longer lists farming as a career category to be checked off.\nAs we moved away from our farms and our farm animals, two particularly devastating mental disconnects blossomed among our children: autism and ADHD. Both conditions are characterized by low levels of oxytocin in the bloodstream. The severity of both has been found to be reduced by giving affected children the opportunity to care for a non-human animal.\nIn a study performed in 1995, oxytocin was found to protect adults against the modern world's leading cause of death. Among 369 victims of heart attack, dog ownership was found to be a better predictor of survival than regularity of heartbeat, absence of diabetes, or strength of the patient's heart. One year after their coronary, 20 of the 369 patients studied had died — only one of the 20 owned a dog.\nWhether or not you think the world would be a better place if we all spent more time stroking Fido or milking Clarabelle, Meg Daley Olmert's \"Made for Each Other\" will convince you there's more to both than meets the eye. You can find \"Made for Each Other\" at that hallmark of civilization: our local library. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "More than half of Talbot County students receive free and reduced lunches\n\n November 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Life \n \n 944\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — More than half of students in Talbot County Public Schools receive free or reduced cost meals at school every week, according to the Maryland Department of Education.Free and reduced meals allow them to eat well at school.\n\"It is basically healthy for them. They get a fruit, a vegetable, a protein and they get a milk,\" said Michelle Garniga, assistant coordinator at the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center for the after school program. She has six children in TCPS.\nThe number of free and reduced meals in a school is a measure of poverty and food insecurity in a community.\nThe Maryland Department of Education found 58.41% of the students in Talbot County received free and reduced meals in 2022-2023, just under 13% higher than it was the school year prior.\nAt some county schools, this rate is even higher.\n\"What drives up the numbers are Easton Middle School and Easton Elementary School,\" said Catharine Poe of the Talbot Hunger Coalition, an organization of food banks and resources fighting food insecurity in the county. \"Easton Elementary is 76% and the Middle School is 64%.\"\nAt other schools, numbers alone may not be enough to gauge the full scope of students' needs. Poe said the Easton High numbers trend lower because the kids do not want the other kids to know they need food.\nDebbie Gardner, communications director for Talbot County Public Schools, said \"We definitely talk about hunger. We consider feeding children to be one of our responsibilities in addition to educating them. We know the needs are greater than even what we see on paper.\"\nFOOD INSECURITYThe increased rate of students receiving free and reduced meals mirrors a growing amount of food insecurity in Talbot County, where costs of food, housing and other necessities are outpacing salary growth.\n\"If you make $15 an hour (minimum wage) and work every single day for a 40 hour week, you only make $31,000. So if you have a family, that is not going to go very far. As soon as you have multiple children, it becomes impossible,\" Poe said. She said you need $38,000 for one person to make it in Talbot County.\nEmily Moody, cofounder of CarePacks, said they started the nonprofit because \"on weekends some kids were not eating until they got back to school on Monday morning. That is the nature of food insecurity — the uncertainty. Free and reduced meals are a lifeline. No question about it.\"\n\"Food insecurity is on the rise everywhere,\" Moody said. \"What we have seen in the school system is an increase in the free and reduced meals program. People are working, but at wages that are not a livable wage and we live in an area where the cost of housing is really exorbitant. The cost for basic necessities like food and gas and utilities have increased. The place where the budget gets squeezed is with food at the grocery budget.\"\nKatie Fox, community school program manager at Easton Elementary School, is the school based coordinator for CarePacks.\n\"Transportation impacts, if you don't have reliable transportation, which a lot of people in Talbot County don't have. That is a non-negotiable,\" Fox said.\nAnd if you live in the far corners of Talbot County like Tilghman Island, it is hard to even get to a grocery store.\"\nMoody said, \"For people who are working full time to be able to afford housing and afford transportation and insurance and utilities. When those needs are met , then ideally there is room in your budget to be able to feed your family too.\"\nIt is not an issue of lazy for the working poor.\n\"It is not that people are not going to work. It is just that living is really expensive right now,\" Fox said.\nFREE AND REDUCED MEALS HELPFamilies in need benefit from the free and reduced meals at the TCPS, which ensure students receive at least two meals a day for five days a week.\n\"It is not easy to give $4 every single day to four or five kids. That is like $24 a day. It would be fairer if everyone got free food. Just because you make more money, it is not fair for kids not to get the lunch,\" Garniga said.\nGarniga said without the program she would be in debt and that over $100 a week for food would be a lot.\n\"It takes a lot of pressure off especially if you have a household with several kids. Being able to rely on the school system to provide breakfast and lunch every day, it is one of the biggest roles that the school plays,\" Poe said.\n\"They have figured out that it would save the average family $1,200 a child each year. It would end all this, and everybody who goes to school gets a free meal,\" Poe said.\nChildren in Talbot County are not alone in experiencing the benefits of free and reduced lunch programs.\nAt the state level, Gov. Wes Moore has signed a state Senate bill requiring the Maryland Department of Education to report to the General Assembly how much it will cost to provide free meals to all public school students in Maryland.\nSB 579 opens with, \"The Maryland General Assembly recognizes the positive impact on student's academic, physical and social and emotional health that results from ensuring students have access to breakfast and lunch programs while at school.\"\nFiguring out how much it costs is the next step in pursuing universal expansion of free school meals, lawmakers argue.\nThe bill still needs to be funded, and it looks like the state budget is getting tighter. According to the latest briefing in the state's Spending Affordability Committee, there is a projected $2.7 billion budget shortfall that will confront the state legislature in January. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In referring to the recent election, Ms. Gill states that the newly elected Talbot County school board members Ann O'Connor and Karla Wieland-Cherry are also members of Moms for Liberty. Ms. Gill describes the Moms as a \"conservative national group\" who advocate for \"changes in curriculum and policies.\"First of all, both Mrs. O'Connor and Mrs. Cherry have repeatedly stated they are not members of Moms for Liberty; they merely participated in a debate sponsored by the Moms in which, to her credit, Ms. Jurrius also took part.\nSecondly, Moms for Liberty is a support group for parents, teachers and citizens who are concerned with the education of the next generation. They provide resources for parents as well as information in educational trends throughout the country. While I have never attended one of their meetings, I do receive their newsletter and follow them on social media. Plus I have numerous friends who regularly attend the meetings.\nTheir agenda is to maintain parental rights through grades K through 12. Additionally, Superintendent Dr. Sharon Pepukayi, and even some of her staff, have attended three or four meetings. If it was so extreme why would they continue to return? Why is this continually portrayed by the Left as a terrible thing?\nThirdly, I wish Ms. Gill had been more specific when mentioning the \"changes in curriculum and policies\" that the Moms are advocating. Is she referring to better scores in English and mathematics, which the Moms advocate? Is she referring to less violence in the schools and classrooms, which they also advocate? Does she mean the schools' dispensing of contraceptives to children, opposed not only by the Moms but also by many parents?\nAs for the mention of concentration camps, in 2019 Trump was criticized by the Left for detention centers that had been built by Obama. Remember the children in cages? That happened under Obama, too. Trying to conflate Trump with the Nazis by mentioning \"concentration camps\" is actually a horrific insult to the millions of victims of the real Nazis. Plus everyone was trying to escape from Hitler's Germany. If America was so bad under Trump, why did people still risk their lives and fortunes to live here?\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A group of Morton's former third grade students at Trappe Elementary School reminisced over lunch.\nSharing stories with one another before Morton arrived, many said she was far and away their \"favorite teacher.\" Morton, who taught at Trappe Elementary School for more than 20 years and still lives in Trappe, turned 100 on May 24.\n\"Can you believe it?\" said Linda James, one of her former students. \"She's 100 years old, and she still knows us.\"\nFellow classmate Ruth Worm said when she and a couple others realized Morton had recently hit her milestone birthday, they knew they needed to organize a time to catch up.\n\"When I called her, she was just (so) excited,\" Worm said. \"She said, 'Oh this is going to be so wonderful.'\"\n\"She was just very genuinely nice and kind,\" Worm said, recalling how Morton treated all of her students the same.\nMany of those that joined to celebrate on Friday graduated high school in 1971 and had Morton as their teacher in the 1961-1962 school year. They recalled what made Morton so memorable and impactful on their lives, even at such a young age.\n\"She left a lasting impression on all of us,\" James said, adding that Morton was \"very sweet\" but still garnered respect from the students. \"She controlled the classroom. She didn't let us walk all over.\"\nAt the time, James said teachers such as Morton were such an integral part of children's lives and growing up. \"That's all we knew, was home and teachers,\" James said.\nFor Susan Watts, Morton's excellence in teaching had a twofold impact. Watts not only had Morton in third grade, but Watts' daughter had the revered teacher in kindergarten as well. Morton's kindness since Watts first met her has carried on ever since, the former student said.\n\"She's still really warm, a very warm person,\" said Watts.\nMorton said she \"loved teaching\" and it's what she wanted to do when going to college. But that aspiration came and went during her college years.\n\"When I went to college, that's what I wanted to do,\" Morton said. \"And walking down the halls my freshman year (hearing), 'What are you going to do when you graduate in June?'\n'Oh I don't know, be a teacher I guess,' And I thought well, that's not for me. So I didn't graduate to be a teacher.\"\nHowever, the itch came back, and she went back into the education field — a decision that surely changed the lives of many who grew up attending Trappe Elementary.\nOn Friday, Morton went around the table, talking to each of her former students. She recalled how one student had a knack for rope climbing back in school.\nNot one student was a troublemaker or misbehaved, Morton said to the Elks Lodge waitress.\n\"Now when we got to the fourth grade, that was a different subject,\" one of her former students joked.\nWhen asked her favorite part of teaching those present on Friday, the same people who sat in her third grade classroom over a half-decade ago, Morton said it was all about the students.\n\"When you had a group like this, why wouldn't they be good?\" Morton said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Stars are gained using multiple indicators, including academic achievement, academic progress, graduation rate and school quality.\nAccording to the report card, the academic achievement indicator went up 0.2 points — from 7.6 to 7.8 — overall at Dorchester elementary schools. At Dorchester middle schools, the academic achievement indicator went up 0.6 points, from 6.7 to 7.3 points. Elementary and middle schools can receive up to 20 points for academic achievement.\nDorchester high schools increased their academic achievement overall by 1.1 point, from 12 to 13.1 points. High schools can receive up to 30 points for academic achievement.\nThe school district news release also stated districtwide improvement in English language arts and math proficiency as well as improved graduation and attendance rates.\n\"While our schools have shown movement in a positive direction, some areas and schools have seen significant gains with others advancing more slowly,\" Superintendent Jymil Thompson said in the news release. \"To achieve our ambitious goal of moving from 23rd to 15th in academic performance statewide, a larger percentage of growth is necessary. Continued focus on targeted strategies and interventions will be crucial to accelerate this progress.\"\nSince becoming superintendent in June, Thompson has made known his hope of bringing the district's ranking up from 23rd to 15th in the state in four years. This year, the district is focusing on instructional leadership, taking a top-down approach in an effort to improve student success.\nIn September, Thompson told the Star Democrat that in order to jump from 23rd in the state to 15th in four years, the district will need to be consistent with developing instructional leadership and following through on it.\n\"Making sure that I'm having meetings with the principals, having conversations on how they're progressing on their goals,\" he said in September. \"And if they're not progressing, how can we shift and go in a little different direction to ensure that they're meeting their goals?\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline superintendent projects 'good budget year,' discusses Blueprint\n\n December 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 617\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — At last week's Caroline County Board of Education meeting, Superintendent Derek Simmons provided board members with a preview into the district's fiscal year 2026 outlook as budget season nears.Simmons said he and his team are in the process of developing a draft budget. What happens in this year's state legislative session is expected to impact how the budget looks, the superintendent said.\n\"We are really contingent upon what happens at the state level for our funding, and we do expect the General Assembly to be very engaged in things that could impact us budget-wise,\" Simmons said. \"So it is 100% likely we will not have a clear picture of our budget, of our revenue numbers until mid-April at best.\"\nAt the Dec. 3 meeting, Simmons reviewed the fiscal year 2025 budget, noting that around 60% of unrestricted funds were spent on salaries and wages. Those funds largely come from the state, as the district received around 66% of its FY25 revenue from the state in unrestricted money.\n\"When we talk about where our expenses come from, it's people,\" Simmons said. \"No surprise as we've said for years, we are a people business. It takes people to educate children. It takes people to make school work.\"\nContracted services accounted for just under 7% of the unrestricted budget. Board Member Troy Plutschak said he wants the board to find out how much auditing through outside companies costs.\nSimmons said the district is often audited, but that moving audits in-house would be difficult and put the district in a \"world of hurt.\" Potentially, one or two finance-related positions would be added, along with adding a stress onto the workload of school principals, Simmons said.\nAccording to the superintendent, he doesn't expect federal money or county allocations to drastically change heading into fiscal year '26. \"We knew '25 was the tight year,\" he said.\nAssuming no major changes are made to the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's initiative to increase education funding, Simmons has an optimistic outlook. That's partly due to increased multilingual learner, special education and overall enrollment in the county.\n\"We are anticipating what should be a good budget year for Caroline County Public Schools,\" Simmons told the board.\nBLUEPRINTWhile there was positivity in the fiscal year 26 forecast, Simmons made clear to board members that the outlook could drastically change if state legislators enact major adjustments to funding in Blueprint.\nChanges to fiscal 26 funding \"can have absolute detrimental impacts to Caroline County Public Schools,\" he said, since Caroline County Public Schools is \"not a district that has extra wealth to go to to fill gaps.\"\n\"Not trying to paint a dire picture, but I don't want to paint roses where they may not exist,\" he said. \"They should. But I want to make sure that everybody in the public is very clear as well. It should be, but if they go changing things in the FY 26 formula, it will hurt in this county more so than others probably.\"\nState legislators may be tasked with discussions about Blueprint funding this winter, as the state faces a predicted budget deficit of $2.7 million for fiscal year 2026.\nBlueprint will require all schools to meet a minimum teacher salary of $26,000 by July 2026. Caroline County Public Schools has not met that mark yet, but Simmons said the district is making progress.\n\"We are still working to get our starting teacher salary up to the mandated $60,000 by FY27,\" Simmons said. \"We have done a great job through negotiations. We're roughly $5,000 away.\"\nLooking to the next budget cycle, salaries and maintaining adequate staffing levels are at the top of mind for the superintendent and his team.\n\"We need to stay competitive with salaries and benefits for all employees,\" Simmons said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, Easton Middle was the lone school in the district to lose a star compared to 2023 ratings.The report card, released by the Maryland State Department of Education on Dec. 3, awards schools points based on performance in four categories: academic achievement, academic progress, progressing in achieving English language arts proficiency, and school quality and student success.\nEaston Middle notched a two-star rating and 32nd percentile rank, down from three stars and 48th percentile last year. Star rating and percentile rank are based off of a school's total points out of 100. Easton Middle scored 44, down from 46.1 in 2023.\nEaston Middle's 2024 scores in academic achievement (7.7 out of 30) and academic progress (16.7 out of 35) remained the same. It increased slightly in English proficiency, from 2.2 to 2.6 out of 10 total points, while decreasing from 19.5 to 17.1 points out of 35 total in school quality and student success.\nTalbot County Public Schools' Director of Communications Debbie Gardner said in a statement that the district is \"closely examining\" the report card results. \"Findings and recommendations\" will be presented to the Talbot County Board of Education at its Dec. 18 meeting, she added.\n\"We are encouraged by the improvement shown in student proficiency in both math and English language arts in all of our student groups,\" the statement read. \"There was progress in other areas as a result of our continued focus on our district priorities. We also see opportunities for additional data collection and analysis to inform our short and long-term planning.\"\nOf the eight schools in the district, St. Michaels Elementary rose from three to four stars, while White Marsh Elementary had the district's largest percentile increase, from the 69th in 2023 to the 82nd percentile in 2024.\nOTHER SCHOOLSOf all schools in Caroline, Dorchester and Talbot counties, Easton Middle was the only one to see a year-to-year decrease in its star rating, though other schools did drop in their percentiles or overall points.\nCompared to fellow middle schools, Easton's 2024 rank slots in above Mace's Lane Middle (two stars, 6th percentile) and Lockerman Middle (two stars, 30th percentile), but below North Dorchester Middle (three stars, 56th percentile) and Colonel Richardson Middle (three stars, 62nd percentile).\nBy student group, the Easton school had mixed results. All student groups saw year-to-year increases in English proficiency except for Black and African American students. Asian students and economically disadvantaged students reached their annual targets in English proficiency, according to the report card results.\nHowever, in math proficiency, only Asian students and multilingual learners improved from 2023. None of the subgroups reached their annual targets in math proficiency.\nTo view the full Maryland School Report Card, visit reportcard.msde.maryland.gov/. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Noam Chomsky at 96: The linguist, educator, philosopher and public thinker has had a massive intellectual and moral influence\n\n December 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Robert F. Barsky The Conversation | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1749\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Robert F. Barsky, Vanderbilt UniversityNoam Chomsky, one of the world's most famous and respected intellectuals, turned 96 years old on Dec. 7, 2024. For more than half a century, multitudes of people have read his works in a variety of languages, and many people have relied on his commentaries and interviews for insights about intellectual debates and current events.\nChomsky suffered a stroke in June 2023 that has severely limited his movement, impaired his speech and impeded his ability to travel. His birthday provides an occasion to consider the tremendous corpus of works that he created over the years and to reflect on the many ways that his texts and recordings still critically engage with contemporary discussions all across disciplines and realms.\nChomsky's vast body of work includes scientific research focused on language, human nature and the mind, and political writings about U.S. imperialism, Israel and Palestine, Central America, the Vietnam War, coercive institutions, the media and the many ways in which people's needs are subjugated in the interest of profit and control.\nAs a scholar of humanities and law, I've engaged with Chomsky's work from an array of perspectives and authored a biography called \"Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent\" and a book on Chomsky's influence called \"The Chomsky Effect: A Radical Works Beyond the Ivory Tower.\" One important theme in his broad corpus is his lifelong fascination with human creativity, which helps explain his vociferous attacks on those who seek to keep the rabble in line.\nEarly daysAvram Noam Chomsky was born on Dec. 7, 1928, in Philadelphia. He and his younger brother, David Chomsky, were raised in a lively household by Elsie Simonofsky and William (Zev) Chomsky, progressive educators who were deeply immersed in wide-ranging Jewish and Zionist cultural activities.\nChomsky often dates his own interest in teaching and learning to his close readings of Hebrew works with his parents and to the lively educational experiences he enjoyed at the Oak Lane County Day School, an experimental school that subscribed to John Dewey's approach to immersive learning and promoted individual creativity over competition with other students.\nA precocious learner, Chomsky at 12 years old read the proofs for his father's book about a 13th-century Hebrew grammarian named David Kimhi. It was an auspicious beginning to a life immersed in philology, philosophy and the study of language and the mind. From very early on, he sought to understand innate human propensities for freedom, dignity and creativity, which inspired his interest in fostering those properties of human nature.\nWhile Chomsky's parents were what he called normal Roosevelt Democrats, he was drawn to more radical approaches to society and to the promotion of noncoercive social structures. At age 10, he read about the Spanish Civil War, which inspired him to write an editorial about the fall of Barcelona for his school's newspaper. This was an early harbinger of his public intellectual work and his vociferous challenges to systems of oppression and illegitimate authority.\nAs a young man, Chomsky joined a socialist wing of the Zionist youth movement that opposed a Jewish state, and from his readings and discussions he came to favor Arab-Jewish class cooperation in a socialist Palestine. His deep knowledge of Palestine and Israel, bolstered by his ability to read and speak Arabic and Hebrew, helped inform his many vehement critiques of Israeli state power.\nRadical pedagogyAfter an early education focused on self-discovery and free-ranging exploration, Chomsky was introduced in high school to rote learning, competition with other students and a mainstream system of values. In reaction, he began to make regular trips to New York City, where he explored bookstores. He also made regular visits with a relative who ran a newsstand on 72nd Street that served as a lively intellectual center for emigrés interested in more radical approaches to society.\nIn 1944, Chomsky completed high school and enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania. Although he has expressed some dismay about the structures of conformity and status quo thinking he encountered there, he did find inspiration in courses with philosopher C. West Churchman, linguist Giorgio Levi Della Vida and, moreover, linguist Zellig Harris. Chomsky knew members of the Harris family because Zellig Harris' father hosted Jewish services in the Harris home that the Chomsky family occasionally attended.\nChomsky's father's approach to the study of language bore similarities to Zellig Harris' work in Semitics, the study of Arabic, Hebrew and other Semitic languages. Harris invited Noam to read the proofs of his \"Methods in Structural Linguistics.\" This highly anticipated book was rooted in the idea that the function and the meaning of linguistic elements are determined by their their relationship to other components that make up sentences. After working hard to understand Harris' linguistics paradigm, Chomsky eventually abandoned it, but he remained fascinated by Harris' political views and by the unstructured, lively and creative debates that he promoted.\nChomsky met Carol Doris Schatz at the Hebrew School where her mother taught and Chomsky's father was principal. Years later, when they were both students at the University of Pennsylvania, they started dating. They were married in 1949, and four years later they decided to move to an Israeli kibbutz, or communal agricultural settlement. They had expected to find a culture of creative free thinking there. Instead, they were deeply disappointed to find what Chomsky described as ideological conformity to Stalinist ideology. They returned to the U.S. after only six weeks.\nThe young couple settled in Boston and started a family. Noam pursued graduate work, while Carol paused her own studies to raise the children. She later returned to research on language acquisition, which she eventually taught and researched at MIT and Harvard. Carol Chomsky died in 2008. Noam remarried in 2014, to the Brazilian translator Valeria Wasserman Chomsky.\nChomskian revolution\nWhen Chomsky was a student, most academic psychologists described human language as a system of habits, skills or dispositions to act that are acquired through extensive training, induction, generalization and association. By this account, language grows incrementally with experience, reinforced by a system of rewards and punishments.\nThis framework was at the heart of a structuralist paradigm, which analyzed the form and meaning of texts as different parts of the same thing. Any language, from this standpoint, restricts how phonemes and morphemes — the smallest units of sound and meaning in language — and other constituents are assembled and distributed. By this view, humans have the capacity to learn language in ways akin to how they acquire other kinds of knowledge.\nChomsky's Ph.D. work, the resulting 1957 book \"Syntactic Structures\" and his New York Review of Books review of B.F. Skinner's \"Verbal Behaviour\" challenged this paradigm and heralded the Chomskian linguistics revolution.\nChomsky's starting point was that humans are endowed with universal grammar, which is activated by exposure to natural language. Children gain proficiency in a language by building on innate knowledge. This means that the capacity for language quite literally grows in the mind in a manner akin to how organs develop in the body.\nChomsky's interest in innate human abilities draws in part from a range of philosophical treatises penned in the 17th and 18th centuries and associated with the Port Royal system of logic and Enlightenment philosophy, which emphasized science, individual liberty and the rule of law. He developed these ideas in a book called \"Cartesian Linguistics,\" which outlined his intellectual debt to the writings of, among others, Descartes, Kant, Rousseau and Wilhelm von Humboldt.\nBy the early 1960s, Chomsky's work had gained him recognition in linguistics, philosophy and psychology. His own research, and that conducted by the growing number of linguists who adopted his approach, led to significant advances in the study of syntax, generative grammar, language and the mind, semantics, form and the interpretation of language.\nHis political engagement was documented in what I believe is a remarkable collection of interviews and books about U.S. imperialism, the Cold War, the Middle East, Central America and Southeast Asia, including \"Problems of Knowledge and Freedom\" and \"For Reasons of State.\" Puzzled by Americans' spirit of resigned consensus, he began to collaborate with Edward S. Herman on books including \"Counter-Revolutionary Violence,\" \"The Political Economy of Human Rights\" and \"Manufacturing Consent,\" which was turned into a popular film by the same name.\nCommon thread\nThe common thread connecting Chomsky's many intellectual projects are four \"problems\" that were the focus of much of his life's work. One is Plato's problem, which considers why it is that humans, whose contact with the world is brief and limited, can come to know so much. The second is Orwell's complementary problem, which asks how is it that human beings know so little given the amount of information to which they have access. The third is Descartes' problem, which pertains to the human capacity to freely express thoughts in constantly novel ways over an infinite range by means that are appropriate to circumstances but not caused by them. Finally, there's Humboldt's problem, which focuses on what constitutes language.\nThese problems are connected in different ways to how people learn, what impedes human development, and to speculations about the initial state of the language faculty, which he outlined in a range of texts, including \"Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin, and Use,\" \"Language and Problems of Knowledge: The Managua Lectures,\" \"The Minimalist Program\" and \"Why Only Us? Language and Evolution,\" with Robert C. Berwick.\nChomsky's legacy\nRemarkably tenacious and active, Chomsky continued to publish and to speak out on contemporary issues into his mid-90s. His ideas evolved but were rooted in a series of deeply seated ideas about the nature of the human mind. He is one of the most cited intellectuals in history, and he was voted the leading living public intellectual in The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll. Millions of people have watched his debates and discussions with William F. Buckley, Angela Davis, Alan Dershowitz, Michel Foucault, Howard Gardner, Christopher Hitchens, Richard Perle, Jean Piaget, Briahna Joy Gray and even Ali G.\nAs the figure widely viewed as the founder of cognitive sciences, Chomsky has been critical of the hype surrounding big data, artificial intelligence and ChatGPT.\nAs a voice for the downtrodden and the oppressed, he has spoken from the perspective of human rights, intellectual self-defense and the popular struggle through independent thinking against structures of power and subjugation.\nChomsky's extraordinary achievements resonate far and wide — and are likely to continue to do so into the future.\nRobert F.

    "content": "'Vision from the beginning': BAAM leaders excited for new academic center\n\n December 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 559\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The tall, welcoming windows in the classrooms of Building African American Minds Inc.'s new academic center in Easton don't just bring in sunlight. They connect the surrounding residents to new opportunities.Three stories high and nearly 25,000 square feet, the center will house classes, tutoring, youth programs, community gatherings and more. It sits on Jowite Street, next to the BAAM Athletic Center and across from a large residential area.\nJames Bell, director of instruction, academic support and community wellbeing for the nonprofit, believes the space fits within the organization's mission of creating an educational and social space for underserved children in the area.\n\"The excitement really is looking out of the windows and seeing the potential,\" Bell says. \"So when you see the community, out of every window here in the facility, it lets you know that it's an opportunity for them as well.\"\nSaturday, Building African American Minds will cut the ribbon on the academic center, which is expected to be up and running in January. The center will allow the nonprofit to significantly expand how many children it serves in after-school and summer enrichment programs.\nThere is a library, media center and multipurpose dining room on the first floor. Above are eight classrooms, as well as speciality rooms for esports, art and music.\nClassrooms are designed with desks situated for full-group, small-group and individual learning.\nDina Daly, executive director of Building African American Minds, pointed out a wellness wing, which will be a private space for health, counseling and more. She added that BAAM's sister agency, private school Polaris Village Academy, will operate out of the academic center in 2025.\nWhile the organization's focus has been serving under-resourced youth in the nearby neighborhoods, its reach isn't limited to children or Talbot County residents, Daly says.\nAdult workforce programs will be hosted in the new academic center during the day. On the third floor, Chesapeake College will begin hosting GED and English second language classes in February.\n\"We had a vision from the beginning,\" Daly said. \"So we're just following up on our vision for what we thought needed to happen, not just for the youth.\"\nIn its 20th year, Building African American Minds has long hoped for an academic center like the one that sits on Jowite Street today. Its previous hub, the athletic center next to the new building, isn't going anywhere either.\nHowever, the new academic center was about a $10 million project, Daly said, more than double what the athletic center cost. Private donors, community donations, and state and federal funding made it possible.\n\"We build for the future,\" Daly said. \"From the inception of BAAM, we always talked about building a school and academic center. It's more than a school now. It's more like a community center, really.\"\nDaly said it's been a long process, but she knows the wait was worth it. Starting small and meeting a select group's needs instead of going too broad, such as when the organization began as a boys-only nonprofit in 2005, was the path to success.\nReflecting on the fact that a 20-year goal is finally coming to fruition, Daly hopes the journey of Building African American Minds can inspire others to start small and dream big.\n\"That's why I tell people, 'don't give up on your dreams,'\" Daly said. \"Make smaller goals, make them achievable, and then just keep building it up. And look at what we've accomplished.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Weiss said. \"My office will hold accountable applicants who undermine the integrity of the federal grant process by knowingly failing to submit complete and truthful applications.\"\nAccording to the settlement agreement, in 2020, UD accepted a grant from NASA, which is prohibited from using funds to collaborate with China or any Chinese-owned companies. While accepting the grant, UD certified that the money would not be used to collaborate or coordinate with China.\nHowever, the government later learned that one of lead professors associated with the grant, Xiao-Hai Yan, did in fact have ties to China.\nYan is a faculty member at Xiamen University in China, received funding from the National Science Foundation of China and participates in a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with knowledge or access to foreign technology intellectual property, according to the settlement.\nThe settlement does not constitute an admission of liability by UD, nor does it prevent the government from pursuing criminal charges against any parties involved.\n\"Along with our law enforcement partners, we will continue to safeguard taxpayer funds that are intended for federal research and development programs,\" said Adelle K. Harris, a special agent in charge for the NASA inspector general.\nYan has been a UD professor since 1990. He teaches in the School of Marine Science and Policy and serves as director of the Center for Remote Sensing.\nAccording to a glowing profile of Yan on UD's marketing website, he is \"internationally known for using satellites in tracking the notorious weathermaker El Niño and in developing new techniques for monitoring global climate change and coastal responses.\" In 2019, he received the Outstanding Doctoral Graduate Advising and Mentoring Award from UD President Dennis Assanis.\nThe article also praises Yan for playing \"an integral role in the university's efforts to improve and expand the intellectual exchange between UD and Xiamen University\" — the Chinese university that UD failed to disclose Yan's involvement with while accepting the NASA grant. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Chopping block or all talk: How much will Trump, GOP Congress cut federal education spending?",
    "date": "2024-12-17",

    "content": "Chopping block or all talk: How much will Trump, GOP Congress cut federal education spending?\n\n December 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG Media | Section: National \n \n 1407\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. Department of Education (DOE) and the federal government roles in K-12 public education are potentially on the chopping block with President-elect Donald Trump and a new Republican Congress taking office next month.That's at least according to campaign stump rhetoric, Trump's own pronouncements and conservative policy blueprints — including the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025.\n\"Federal education policy should be limited and, ultimately, the federal Department of Education should be eliminated,\" according to Project 2025's policy recommendations. The agency has a total budget of $241.7 billion.\nProject 2025, which stirred criticism from the left during the 2024 campaign, calls for Title 1 federal funding for poorer schools to be shifted back to the states and localities. Title 1 funding totaled more than $18.4 billion in fiscal year 2024, according to the Center for American Progress.\nOther federal education spending would be shifted to other departments, converted into grants to states and localities or eliminated.\nThe goal is to minimize the federal role in education and have localities and states enable (and fund) education savings accounts (ESAs) for parents and guardians to use for charter and private schools and other options.\nTrump has distanced himself from Project 2025 saying he was not involved in its formation and he does not agree with all its ideas. But Trump recently told Time Magazine — which named him 2024 Person the Year — he favored eliminating DOE.\n\"You're going to need some people just to make sure they're teaching English in the schools. Okay, you know English and mathematics, let's say. But we want to move education back to the states,\" Trump said.\nHezekiah Herrera, a special education teacher in San Diego, has been following the issue and how what happens in Washington might impact school districts and special needs instruction.\n\"Advocates say that diminished federal power grants states and localities more control to shape policies to suit their specific needs. Some also argue that it will spur innovation and cut bureaucratic red tape, resulting in efficient, more streamlined decision-making,\" Herrera said. \"On the other hand, a lack of federal guidance may exacerbate allocation inequalities, especially in states with fewer resources.\"\nAxing or gutting, Title 1 and other programs aimed at helping poor kids worries Stefano Lodola, owner of Think Languages LLC and Think in Italian (a Wyoming-based foreign language instruction company).\n\"The consequences of cutting or eliminating the DOE would be widespread and severe. Federal funding, which constitutes approximately 8% of total K-12 education funding nationwide, plays a vital role in supporting programs like Title I, which serves over 25 million students in low-income areas, and Pell Grants, which help nearly 7 million college students afford higher education,\" Lodola said. \"Without these funds, disparities between wealthier and poorer states would likely grow, leaving underfunded schools even more resource starved.\"\nProject 2025 and conservatives also oppose expansions of free and reduced lunch programs at poorer schools. That $17.2 billion program serves 28 million low-income kids and is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nThe Project 2025 blueprint and some Republicans also want to eliminate Head Start — a $11.4 billion program that provides preschools to close to 800,000 lower-income kids. They contend it is inefficient and wasteful.\nIt is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nTherein lies some of the rub when it comes to a conservative, Trump or government efficiency efforts to be championed by Elon Musk.\nBen Wallerstein, CEO of Whiteboard Advisors (a Washington D.C.-based education policy and consulting firm), said in addition to education programs handled by other agencies, a number of federal education statutes \"long predate the creation of the Department of Education.\"\nHe said narrow GOP majorities in Congress and the complexities of shuttering an entire agency and accompanying statutes make the odds of a complete DOE closure long.\n\"Eliminating the department would require statutory change. Republican lawmakers will introduce bills to that effect, but Democratic Senators can rely on the filibuster to stop the process. In the end, a complete elimination of the department seems unlikely,\" Wallerstein said in a post-election analysis.\nPatrick Riccards, who served as an education advisor and consultant to the Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama administrations, said some of the education talk from the right may be just that — talk.\n\"We've been talking about getting rid of the U.S. Department of Education since it was founded in the seventies,\" Riccards said.\nHe said a complete elimination is doubtful, but he does see moves to give states and localities more flexibility in how they spend federal money and how they approach K-12 schools.\n\"Congress isn't really interested in public education. They believe it is a state and local issue,\" said Riccards, who also previously served on the school board in Falls Church, Virginia.\nThat's what the Heritage Foundations and conservatives want.\n\"The future of education freedom and reform in the states is bright and will shine brighter when regulations and red tape from Washington are eliminated. Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes. It raises the cost of education without raising student achievement,\" the conservative think tank writes in its controversial report.\nSPECIA\nL EDUCATION\nApproximately 7.6 million special needs students receive special education services funded via the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). That's 15% of all public school students.\nWhen IDEA was approved in 1975, advocates hoped to see the feds cover 40% of special education costs. For 2024, Congress and the Biden administration allocated $15.4 billion under IDEA, according to the Congressional Research Service.\nContemporary funding covers 14.7% of total special education spending, according to the Special Needs Alliance. Full funding requires $43.3 billion, according to SNA.\nLodola worries about special education potentially getting hit hard by federal rollbacks or a downsized DOE.\n\"The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which ensures that 7.6 million students with disabilities receive a free and appropriate public education, depends heavily on federal funding and enforcement. Without the DOE, many states may lack the resources or political will to adequately support these programs, leaving vulnerable children and their families to shoulder the burden,\" he said.\nHerrera agrees.\n\"Without a department, the future of IDEA compliance would almost certainly fall to the states, resulting in wide variation in how (or if) services are provided. This may leave families without the resources or legal protections they currently depend on. Some states may not have the budget to support special education services at the same level without federal funding.\"\nJacqueline Cooper, a Washington D.C.-based attorney who also holds a special education certification, said she has already seen some states \"not providing equitable and sufficient education because of a lack of resources, staffing and content development.\" She worries about that dynamic if federal oversight is removed.\n\"I believe in the arena of education we need federal standards that are implemented at the state level. Without the guidance and supervision of a federal agency, many states will not provide support to those who are in need of support,\" Cooper said.\nThat could extend to civil rights law and which federal agency takes the lead in those in the education realm. Trump and his acolytes could also focus on high-profile fights over transgender rights related to high school sports and school restrooms.\nRiccards said special education parents have proven effective voices for education at the state and local levels and could bring that energy if Congress goes down that path.\nHe sees Linda McMahon — Trump's pick for education secretary — championing literacy and vocational education programs and giving more education power and flexibility to states and localities. Wallerstein said that is something states have wanted for years.\nMcMahon served as small business administrator in Trump's first administration. McMahon and her husband, Vince McMahon, both of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) fame and fortune, contributed more than $21 million to Trump's 2024 efforts, according to campaign finance filings.\nRobert Kesten, executive director of Stonewall National Museum Archives and Library in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, expects the incoming administration and Trump's backers in Congress to step up efforts to promote private and charter school vouchers and tax credits and other alternatives to public schools. Conservative lawmakers and policy groups have been pushing for that in various states.\n\"This is now moving to a steroid version of that,\" Kesten said.\nWhile conservatives want to see less federal impacts on the education system and more control by local communities and parents, Kesten worries about right-wing agendas being emboldened, increasing their efforts related to curricula, textbook content and school library offerings.\n\"Those are things we should be alarmed about,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Budget discussions kicked off at Talbot Board of Ed work session\n\n December 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 619\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot Board of Education was presented with preliminary budget considerations during a Monday work session as planning for the fiscal year 2026 budget is underway.Talbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones outlined the priorities her team is focusing on. Those priorities include achieving academic equity in math, fostering an engaging environment for students and staff, and recruiting and retaining staff members.\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi said those areas were determined as priorities during a board retreat last year.\n\"When the dust all ended, we said that these were the three priorities that we wanted to move forward with,\" Pepukayi said. \" … And then most recently, we've talked about special education being a focus for us as well.\"\nDuring the meeting, Jones provided an overview of the budget process and how the state's expansive 10-year education funding initiative, The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, allocates money on a per-student basis.\n\"Every student in our system grades (K-12) qualifies for a base amount, and that's called our foundation funding,\" Jones said. \"That's how we keep our lights on. That's how we have insurance.\"\nThen, depending on student classifications in other categories, such as multilingual learners and special education, more money is allocated to a school. Each school receives different funding based on their enrollment statistics, Jones said.\nShe added that the expectation from the state is that \"at least 75%\" of the money given toward a certain school is \"spent directly at that school.\" Costs related to human resources, finance and transportation often aren't school-specific.\nAccording to Jones, the district needs to \"make some shifts\" in two programs — compensatory education and multilingual learners — in order to comply with Blueprint requirements. No district in the state is fully compliant at this time, she noted, but the Blueprint Accountability & Implementation Board is seeking progress.\n\"We're just not spending enough money on those areas to meet criteria,\" Jones said.\nPepukayi said the strict requirements affect funding for smaller schools, a topic that's come up in her discussions with fellow superintendents on the Eastern Shore.\n\"The foundation funding is insufficient to do all that we need to do, particularly for the smaller schools, the districts that have smaller schools,\" she said. \" … It's compliance-driven and rigidness for our budgeting versus giving us the flexibility to make those decisions and differentiate ourselves.\"\nSchools and departments in the district submit budgets every year, along with providing a list of requested positions. Position requests include teachers, coaches, English second language professionals, special education staff and social workers.\n\"We're not at the level where we were at last year,\" Jones added.\nBoard President Emily Jackson brought up whether or not the district could revisit previous hopes to hire someone for a grants manager position since managing grants is a significant stress on the finance department.\nJones said it's \"burdensome\" to track all of the necessary results and data from grants.\n\"You have to have a really detailed knowledge of the public education landscape to be able to write those grants, I would say,\" Jones said. \"And that was our challenge.\"\nHowever, Jones was optimistic on the prospect that a grants manager could eventually help Talbot County Public Schools bring in more revenue.\n\"Hiring a grant person might make sense financially,\" she said. \"They might at least be able to pay for themselves, and then hopefully generate some revenue in other ways.\"\nThe Talbot County Board of Education will meet with the Talbot County Council on Jan. 7 to discuss a proposed budget. The proposed budget will first be brought to the board at a Jan. 13 work session, and then on Jan. 15 for first reader.\nAs of now, a public hearing on the budget is scheduled for Feb. 10, with a potential board vote slated for Feb. 12. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "St. Michaels' Classic Motor Museum donation campaign for new property\n\n December 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 516\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST MICHAELS — The Classic Motor Museum is seeking to grow its space on Talbot Street, aiming to complete the purchase of an extension by Jan. 17.With about $300,000 left to raise of their $1.2 million goal, volunteers and members of the museum are making last efforts to raise enough donations to make it happen.\nThe Classic Motor Museum is a nonprofit organization dedicated to appreciating, preserving and showcasing America's heritage of automotive innovation and adaptation.\nThe extension would be used to provide hands-on experiences for students of the organization's Automotive Technician Apprenticeship Program. This three-year program began in 2022. It comprises 2,000 hours annually of on-the-job training in a local facility with one-on-one mentorship and 160 hours of classroom instruction per year through online resources.\nApprentices are commissioned by an automotive repair and maintenance shop for the program. Additionally, they are given a $4,500 stipend for tools after three months of training.\nGina Verhalen, administrator of the Classic Motor Museum, said so far the Drive Forward Capital Campaign to purchase the 906 S. Talbot St. property has gathered over $900,000 in donations.\n\"It just shows the incredible support that we have from not just the community,\" Verhalen said. \"We have a number of donors, and we don't even recognize their names, so we know that the support goes well beyond just St. Michaels.\"\nVerhalen said nationwide there has been an active decline in the number of new automotive technicians. According to the TechForce Foundation, an organization providing sholarships and other support to students in tech fields, the automotive industry needs 258,000 new automotive technicians every year, yet only 48,000 are graduated.\nVerhalen said the museum's apprenticeship program is providing people with the opportunity to explore new career avenues and learn from experienced instructors.\nJim McCrea, an instructor for the program, said prior to retirement he had worked 48 years in the automotive industry. For McCrea, the development of new property would provide valuable opportunities for the students and also for the town.\nThe renovation plans for the property would include renovating the building back to a '50s style gas station while providing classroom learning inside. McCrea said currently the property is a bit of an eyesore, but if the museum is able to purchase and renovate the property it could be a classic part of the town.\n\"The real reason we wanted to get this (property) is so we could have more of a hands-on place for them. It's more realistic as far as working in a shop,\" McCrea said.\nMichael Landolo, director of education at the museum, said those living on the Eastern Shore should feel invested in the outcome of the new generation and have a responsibility to make sure the area has a pathway for young people to find good jobs in their hometowns.\n\"It's really investing in the future, and it's allowing the young men and women who may not have a pathway to college, may not even have an interest in it, but they still want to have a job where they use their brains, they use their hands and they can be someone who's really contributing to society,\" Landolo said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's monotonous, tedious, and humbling, but also stimulating, uplifting, and gratifying. Kaeo and Carstan have moved through everything that it is, and they've come out of the other end of it in good working order, perfectly capable, and with plenty of enthusiasm to keep on going.\"\nClarke is a native of Annapolis. His father runs the Oak Harbor Marina in Pasadena, Maryland and he was working there in 2021, learning the basics of maintenance and rigging on modern metal and fiberglass vessels, when he applied for the apprenticeship in CBMM's Shipyard to learn the trade of wooden boat building.\n\"In my interview, I said that I'm much better at moving boats than building them,\" Clarke said. \"I still don't consider myself an expert at woodworking or boat building, but I can tell you that I know a whole lot more now than I did when I got here.\"\nHe's also worked on the Maryland Dove build and the refit of Chesapeake Bay buyboat Winnie Estelle.\n\"It's an honor to be part of Dove's story,\" Clarke said. \"There are a couple portions of that boat I can point at and say, 'Yeah, I did that.'\"\nGage is from Oregon and made the cross-country move to CBMM in August 2022 with a design degree and experience working as a carpenter but little familiarity with boats.\n\"I would say the community is a big part of why I was able to succeed here,\" Gage said. \"All of the people here are very helpful, and they've created an atmosphere where it's OK to take your time and really learn.\nGage has spent most of his time at CBMM focused on helping to maintain its floating fleet. One of the highlights was getting the historic skipjack Rosie Parks fit for sailing for the first time in several years, which included replacing sections of the sheer clamp, side planking, and deck boards, CBMM said in an announcement.\nGage sailed on Rosie Parks this fall to the skipjack race in Cambridge and Sultana Downrigging Festival.\n\"After all that, I feel confident in saying Rosie is probably the best-looking skipjack on the Bay right now,\" Gage said. \"I had a big part in that, so that's a good feeling.\"\nThe pair logged the requisite 4,000 hours of hands-on experience, plus additional skill development training, under the direction of CBMM's staff.\nAfter words from program supporter and CBMM Board Emeritus Tom Seip, Hilgartner, and Shipwright Educator Steve Garrand, the offered his congratulations to the new graduates of a program that is unique in its scope and ambition, not just across the state but nationally.\n\"This is truly a standalone program,\" said Maryland Department of Labor's Director of Apprenticeship & Training Chris MacLarion. \"This is the only registered one that I can find on the books anywhere in the country left that's doing this through the state or federal government, that's registering apprentices, training them, and graduating them to not only not lose the knowledge and the skills but to carry it down to the next generation.\"\nThat impressed Clarke.\n\"That was really cool to hear,\" Clarke said. \"I didn't know we were such rare birds in this program, but I'm happy to have been one.\"\nCBMM's Shipwright Apprentice Program will add two more Shipwright Apprentices in the new year.

A $500,000 grant was given to the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation, which is funding STEM centers at 10 different schools in Maryland, including Lockerman.\nCaroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said the foundation's contribution is bringing unique experiences to Lockerman students.\n\"There's no way that this level of resource and these tools would be able to get in the hands of our middle school kids if it wasn't for your partnership and Ripken Foundation's work,\" Simmons said.\nOn Tuesday, students showed off the new tools and gadgets that were funded by the grant, such as a 3D printer, coding robots and electronic kits. In the school cafeteria, two students flew drones.\nSixth grader Gracie Spiering showed off her knowledge of how to make backpack security alarms or model cars using littleBits Electronic kits. She knew how to order the kit's pieces and wires, and learned how the coding worked.\n\"It's been so much fun to have in class,\" Spiering said. \"Everybody's been so ready to come into that class.\"\nMeanwhile, many students have been utilizing the 3D printers to make ornaments for the holidays. Seventh grader Madison Watson said it's been a smooth learning process thanks to the help of her teachers.\n\"It's pretty fun to have them just at any time we really want them to be here,\" Watson said.\nLockerman Middle School Principal Jeannine Necessary said students love learning how to use the new materials. Staff members were trained and encouraged to integrate the STEM tools into everyday learning, the principal said.\nDuring the ribbon-cutting, University of Maryland Shore Regional Health President and CEO Ken Kozel said the healthcare system appreciates students involved in STEM because the students are \"highly motivated and educated.\"\n\"We're here to promote STEM because it's such an important part of the healthcare system,\" Kozel said. \"We're local, we're small, we're a community hospital system, but we need our community to help support our workforce needs.\"\nWith a handful of students excited to show off the new technology on Tuesday, Simmons reflected on how much the grant means to the Denton middle school, given the district's financial challenges.\n\"About 60 to 65 percent of our students qualify for free and reduced meals, which puts a little bit different lens on the opportunities that our kids have to access things,\" Simmons said. \"It also puts a lens on the opportunity the school system has funding-wise to be able to provide those avenues.\n\"We are thrilled that we were selected by you guys, in partnership with the Ripken Foundation, to be able to provide opportunity and access that we could've never funded for our students.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Beloved bus driver 'Mrs. Dea' brings holiday cheer to young passengers\n\n December 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lilly Howard lhoward@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1200\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CECIL COUNTY — Nedean Crawford, more commonly known as Mrs. Dea, is much more than a bus driver to the students she drives to and from school each day, where she makes a lasting impression on their lives through her caring nature and holiday cheer.\"When they're on my bus, they're my kids,\" Mrs. Dea said. \"It's like you're a teacher, you're a nurse, you're a psychiatrist, you know, you're a mother, you're a counselor, you're all of those things, just not a school bus driver.\"\nOver her 28 years driving with Marshall Bus Company, during which she has averaged around 61 students per semester, Mrs. Dea has made an impact on many lives as a positive female role model.\nShe greets each and every student entering and leaving the bus each morning and afternoon, and spends extra time getting to know them.\n\"A little bit of 'hello,' or a little hug or something like that, really makes that child's day,\" Mrs. Dea said. \"And if I see it on their face, that they're not right, we get to the school a little bit early and I say, 'Come on, come and talk to Mrs. Dea. What's going on? Tell me your story.'\"\nHer route includes Elk Neck Elementary, North East High School and their Twilight program for students who need extra help.\nMany of the middle school students who grew up riding her bus look forward to reuniting with her in high school.\n\"My oldest is now a big sixth grader and says 'I miss Mrs. Dea' because her new bus driver, even though he's nice and all, is just not the same,\" one parent, Todd Hudson, said.\nThe feeling is mutual.\n\"It's the kids that keep coming me back,\" Mrs. Dea said. \"Once they go into middle school for three years, six to eight. I don't see them, but I get them back in ninth grade, and it's such a joy to see how much they've grown since…it's just amazing. I'm 61 years old, and it's just, oh, it really gets to you…on my elementary run, my kids just love me, hug me every day, and it makes my day. And that's what has me coming back day after day after day.\"\nAccording to Mrs. Dea, retirement is not a decision that's up to her.\n\"I can't retire, because I get them back in high school and the parents say that you can't retire until my child graduates,\" Mrs. Dea said.\nAll four of Ashley Culley-Meekin's children have experienced riding with Mrs. Dea.\n\"My son, who's in kindergarten this year, calls her the magic school bus driver,\" Culley-Meekins said, adding that Mrs. Dea cares about the children and is always decorating her school bus and dressing up for each and every holiday.\nThe interior roof of Mrs. Dea's bus 77 is currently embellished in battery powered string lights with festive colors for the holidays. She hung garland with ornaments above the windows and along the side of the bus as well.\nMrs. Dea started this tradition five years ago when she found out some of her students didn't have a Christmas tree at home.\n\"So I decorated the bus like it was a Christmas tree so that they could feel and see what a Christmas tree would be like, other than, you know, really not having the green branches, but just giving them an idea with the lights and the garland. And it clicked, so I continued to do it every year,\" Mrs. Dea said.\nWhen those students came home telling their parents about the Christmas decorations in the bus, their mom had to see for herself, and peeked inside in awe when picking her kids up from the bus stop one day.\nIn addition to the lights, Mrs. Dea puts on the radio and the students sing along when holiday favorites come on the airwaves, like \"Rudolph.\" Mrs. Dea always makes the students on the bus feel special.\n\"If they have a bad day at school and they get on Mrs. Dea's bus, they're always happier when they get home…even the little things, like she'll give them Halloween goodie bags and Christmas goodie bags, just to brighten their day,\" one parent with four children who have ridden on bus 77, Heidi Smith said.\nBut more than the jolly songs and goodie bags, Mrs. Dea watches out for every child that comes through her bus doors.\n\"The most important thing besides all that, is her caring for not only my kids, but a bus full…She treats them like they're her own [children]. She's always aware of her bus at all times,\" Culley-Meekins said.\nSmith's son RJ is diabetic and Mrs. Dea carries Smarties candy and bags of chips in case his blood sugar drops on the bus. This happened recently, and when RJ's glucose monitor beeped indicating low blood sugar, Mrs. Dea safely pulled over to ensure his levels evened out before she dropped him off.\n\"I feel safe with all of my kids on there. But like, RJ, being diabetic, I don't know that I would trust another bus driver,\" Smith said, adding that Mrs. Dea always checks in with RJ to ensure his blood sugar levels are steady, and carries snacks just in case.\nShe is attentive to every child on the bus.\n\"There have been times where she has stopped the bus in front of my house for my kids to get off the bus, and she's quickly closed the doors because a car has ran through the bus,\" Culley-Meekins said.\nMrs. Dea mentioned that some of her biggest challenges come from outside of her magical bus, with crazy drivers, road conditions, and bad weather causing problems.\nLast year during a series of storms, a tree fell across Elk Neck Road, blocking Mrs. Dea's route and leaving the bus full of kids stranded, according to Hudson, a parent of students on this bus at the time who was called to move the tree.\n\"Mrs. Dea was playing games, keeping the kids occupied…They were stranded for quite a while. So she was tap dancing, doing everything she could to keep the kids entertained, under control, and happy and not scared,\" Hudson said, adding that she even sent his children home with baked goods the following day as a thank you for clearing the road.\nMrs. Dea is always doing her best to make the children on her bus happy.\nBus driving is an often overlooked career choice and drivers sometimes face the stigma that they are uneducated, but Mrs. Dea emphasized that she could and has pursued other careers, but does this because she loves the kids.\n\"I don't have to drive a school bus. I choose to drive a school bus,\" Mrs. Dea said.\nBefore bus driving, Mrs. Dea graduated in the top third of her class at Glasgow High School in Delaware, went to college, and became a certified dental assistant until she had to have rotator cuff surgery five times and was unable to continue this work.\n\"I would never go back to the dental field, even if my arm got better…I really enjoy driving the bus. The kids are fantastic,\" Mrs. Dea said. \"There's a lot of times as bus drivers, we get overwhelmed, and sometimes you don't feel appreciated. But I do have a good run…I wouldn't give this run up for anything.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This application is due in March, she said.\nStudents will be selected for enrollment via lottery, with all county students eligible to attend, she said.\nOptions for school facilities are still being explored with the hopes to mirror Frederick County and Anne Arundel counties' business park locations, Scott said.\n\"It would be a real feather in the cap of Queen Anne's County to have the first one on the Eastern Shore,\" Scott said.\nA public meeting about QACCS welcomes the community to learn more Jan. 25, 2025 at 10 a.m. at Kent Island Fire Department, 1610 Main Street in Chester.\nMore information including a petition of support can be found at QueenAnnesCCS.com and its Facebook page. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "State eyes new way to count students in need\n\n December 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JACK BOWMAN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 376\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland is set to examine its current method of evaluating poverty in schools throughout the next year, potentially opening a pathway to boost funding for schools with students in need.A new study is meant to address the undercounting of poverty in Maryland public schools, according to Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman. The Board of Public Works approved funding for the study at its Dec. 4 meeting.\n\"This issue is exacerbated for undocumented students or citizen children of undocumented parents,\" Lierman said at that meeting.\nThe current method of tabulating poverty \"really penalizes\" schools with large numbers of immigrant students, Lierman said.\nThe state currently uses proxy measures, such as eligibility for national programs like Medicaid and SNAP, to calculate aid for public schools, according to the proposal for funds from the Department of General Services.\nAccording to the Governor's Office for Children, an accurate count of students in poverty is important to ensure that they get adequate resources. The office also told CNS that the \"Blueprint for Maryland's Future created several new school funding streams that rely on counts of low-income students.\"\nSchools currently rely on applications for the free and reduced meals program and enrollment in social programs like Medicaid as methods of calculating student poverty. According to the Governor's Office for Children, \"not all low income families participate in these programs.\"\nThe office also said that \"districts that provide free school meals to all students under the federal community eligibility program do not collect that data.\"\nIn the case of immigrant families, some may not qualify or, as the office told CNS, may be hesitant to enroll and reveal their citizenship status.\nOther data the state might rely upon is out of date. According to Lierman, the Maryland State Department of Education recently proposed using data from 2013 to calculate school poverty in Baltimore City. Lierman said that many public schools have been shuttered in the city since that data was collected.\n\"As a Baltimore City Public School mom,\" Lierman said, \"I've got a lot of strong feelings about this.\"\nThe board approved the DGS request for $48,000 monthly for \"modeling, analysis and providing a presentation on findings.\"\nAccording to the Office for Children, a recommendation based on the results of the study will be made to the Maryland General Assembly by Dec. 1, 2025. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chesapeake College works to become Hispanic-Serving Institution\n\n January 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: VERONICA FERNANDEZ-ALVARADO valvarado@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 950\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Zulema Delacruz Martinez, a 2024 graduate of Chesapeake College, was described by the school's faculty as an achievement.During her time at Chesapeake College, she was a founder of the Hispanic/Latino Student Union, the chair of the annual Unity Fest and a mentor for area high school students with TRiO's Upward Bound summer program.\n\"She's the type of person that (Chesapeake College) would love to see her success repeated in many more,\" said Lorelly Solano, director at the Chesapeake College Cambridge Center.\nDelacruz Martinez credited support programs like TRiO, a federal student services program, for her own college success. She said having TRiO provided her opportunities for academic success and to better understand financial resources for education. It is programs such as TRiO that motivated her to lead in the creation of the Hispanic/Latino Student Union.\n\"In my mind, when I founded (Hispanic/Latino Student Union), it's more like, 'How can I help others? What kind of resources can I create, or kind of resources can become available, so that way the students coming after me, who come from similar backgrounds, they don't have to worry as much, and they can focus more on being students, focus on being essentially teenagers and young adults enjoying college life and creating connections?'\" Delacruz Martinez said.\nThe student union hosts community nights to assist Latino community members who are having trouble filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, commonly called FAFSA.\nThis form assists current and prospective college students to determine their eligibility for student financial aid. The Hispanic/Latino Student Union has been leading Chesapeake College's Latino student recruitment by hosting events catered to potential students.\nDelacruz Martinez said that more than 90% of attendees of FAFSA Nights applied to Chesapeake College. She assisted families from all age groups, including grandparents with limited knowledge of the internet.\nChesapeake College, a public two-year regional community college in Wye Mills, is going through changes to address the growing Hispanic population.\nAccording to Marcie Alvarado Molloy, director of public information at Chesapeake College, over the last decade the Hispanic population at the school has increased by more than 64% and is expected to continue to grow.\nThe college has made an effort to translate all pamphlets and documents for Spanish speaking families and students. Additionally, the school is trying to increase the number of Spanish-speaking staff, especially in key offices like financial aid. The college has made efforts to collaborate with family liaisons from Talbot County Public Schools and has attended various community events to increase the school's presence and visibility.\nClifford Coppersmith, president of Chesapeake College, said the college is on its way to becoming a Hispanic-Serving Institution. A Hispanic-Serving Institution is defined by the U.S. Department of Education as an eligible institution with an undergraduate enrollment that is at least 25% Hispanic.\nAccording to the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, in 2023 there were about 600 Hispanic-Serving Institutions in the United States. The U.S. Department of Education offers Hispanic-Serving Institutions 64 grants through the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institution program, and in 2023 the Biden-Harris Administration announced it would award more than $40 million to support Hispanic/Latino students.\nCoppersmith said more and more Hispanic students are transferring from Chesapeake College to four-year colleges every year.\n\"So with our Hispanic population, up until probably fairly recently, the predominant interest has been short-term non-credit, but more and more we are seeing Hispanic students getting into transfer education,\" Coppersmith said. \"They intend to go in and get bachelor's degrees.\"\nGENERATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTSolano said she appreciates the collaboration Chesapeake College does with schools and nonprofits to help accomplish the academic dreams of the Hispanic community.\n\"When our society is so polarized, and you also hear a lot of negative rhetoric about immigrants, I think it is so important for for these kids and for their families to actually demonstrate to themselves and to others that that they actually can achieve their dreams, that they can show this very dignified side of of their dreams, because, quite frankly, this is about generational achievement,\" Solano said.\nCollege degrees have generational impacts on families. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' Center for Household Financial Stability, families with at least two generations of college graduates have median income and wealth that are higher than those of families where fewer generations have college degrees. Hispanic families across the county have been enrolling their children in record numbers over the past two decades, according to the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.\nIn 2023, Chesapeake College welcomed its class with Hispanic students making up the largest minority student demographic at more than 43% of the college's more than 1,395 minority students.\nDuring this year's graduation Delacruz Martinez was awarded the John T. Harrison Award. This award is given each year to a student who has demonstrated the highest academic performance, leadership and overall contributions to the college and the community.\nMilton Nagel, vice chair of the Chesapeake College Board of Trustees, presented the award to Delacruz Martinez and gave her praise for her commitment to Hispanic and Latino students within the region who are interested in college but may be intimidated by the academic process.\nDelacruz Martinez, said she is happy to see schools throughout the Eastern Shore adapting to the growing Latino population through different programs and the efforts to hire diverse faculty and staff. According to Delacruz Martinez, these efforts are not going unnoticed.\n\"Hispanic Latino students are resilient. We are very, very, very hardworking,\" Delacruz Martinez said. \"We will put in the effort if given the chance. But this issue is that sometimes we aren't given that chance. We have to focus on other difficult situations we are placed in, within our own homes, within their own communities. So invest in us, and we will certainly put in the effort.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

In order to celebrate the foundation's accomplishments and to share the upcoming year's goals, the foundation held a gala/luncheon for its supporters on Dec. 14.During the foundation's annual fundraiser event, over a 100 people gathered together to participate in a silent auction and honor scholarship recipients, their experiences and their accomplishments.\nKeasha Haythe, founder of Foundation of HOPE, said the fundraiser provides the opportunity for donors and supporters of the organization to see the progress made so far through presentations and speakers, including past students and scholarship recipients.\n\"It was really good to have people in the room to hear about where we've been, where we're going, what our goals and our priorities are to expand the program to not only have more girls participate, but also to serve the community,\" Haythe said.\nHaythe said speakers for the event included 2024 scholarship recipients Kaleigh Hammond and Michaela Gibson. Gibson, a student at John Hopkins, and Hammond, a student at Chesapeake College, shared their experiences with the program and how the foundation helped them achieve their goals.\nHaythe said they were a part of the second cohort of the program, which offers after-school classes to sixth-grade girls.\nHaythe said the Foundation of HOPE program was established in 2018 with the goal to teach middle school girls how to be viable contributors to the future workforce. The program covers topics including addressing low self-esteem, bullying, social media, workforce development, and economic and community development.\nHaythe said over the years the program has grown to cater to more girls in the community. According to Haythe, the program hopes to grow to include 30 students. Additionally, they hope to start pre construction work for a foundation headquarters around quarter two of 2025.\nAccording to Haythe, the foundation received $150,000 from the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development in December. The foundation has launched the capital campaign to the public.\nHaythe said supporters can make donations to the foundation in many ways, but she encourages the public to show their appreciation for women or girls in their lives by honoring them with a Rose of Hope. A Rose of Hope is a donation made in someone else's honor to help support the foundation's Economic Development and Empowerment program. Names of those honored are shared on the foundation's website and listed at the Annual Gala Program.\nHaythe said she is proud of the opportunity to help girls in the program. She shared that Gibson wanted to study marine biology in sixth grade and now she is studying at John Hopkins. For Haythe, continuing to foster that growth and belief in young girls is what she enjoys.\n\"I think looking over the last year, I've been most proud of how the girls who have completed the program have blossomed into young women,\" Haythe said. \"How they are following their dreams. I mean, these dreams that they had in sixth grade, they're manifesting for them… these young ladies are truly understanding who they are, and they're developing in the program, and after completing the program, into nice young ladies that are going after their dreams.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Biden, Jr. School of Public Policy & Administration and Biden Institute,\" UD spokesman Christopher Vito said.\nThe Biden Institute was created after Biden left the vice presidency in 2017, and it is currently located in the old Blue and Gold Club on Kent Way. Chaired by the president's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, the Biden Institute hosts events, brings prominent speakers to campus and focuses on developing domestic public policy.\nUD's highly ranked School of Public Policy & Administration, which was renamed for Biden in 2018, offers undergraduate and graduate programs in leadership, public administration, public policy, public health, disaster management and related fields. It is currently headquartered in Graham Hall on Academy Street.\nVito said the Biden Hall project is still in the early stages, and more details will be made public as the process moves forward.\n\"This modern facility will harness the latest technology to cultivate academic growth, interdisciplinary research collaborations, dialogue, and civil discourse, all of which are crucial to a flourishing democracy in the 21st century,\" he added.\nThe new building will be located on the main campus in Newark, but the specific location has yet to be determined.\n\"We are fundraising and planning with intent to enter design and programmatic planning in the 2025 calendar year,\" Vito said.\nFormer Gov. John Carney included $20 million in state funding for Biden Hall in his recommended capital budget, which he released just one day before resigning to be sworn in as mayor of Wilmington.

If a student leaves the pouch at home, they put their phone in the school office for the day.\nEvery classroom in Caroline County comes equipped with a wired phone for use in case of an emergency, and teachers have been given a special pair of scissors to cut through cellphone pouches if needed.\nFor students with health needs, the schools offer special services allowing students to check their phones for medical purposes only.\nThere have been talks within the county of expanding cellphone pouches to ninth graders in coming years, but that determination has not yet been made, district officials said.\nIn determining whether the pouch program will be expected, the district still has to weigh the pros and cons, officials said. They hope that by the end of the school year they will have a solid understanding of the program's successes and shortcomings.\nSUCCESSES\nThe pouches have done a good job at keeping students off their phones during the school day, district officials said. But beyond that, the middle schools where the pouches have been implemented have seen some other benefits from the program.\nThe cellphone pouches help prevent cyber bullying in the school during the school day, they said. Students have needed less disciplinary intervention since the pouches were rolled out.\n\"We've seen about a 21% reduction in discipline incidents,\" Simmons said.\nSimmons also said teachers report that taking cellphones out of the picture has allowed them to better focus on instructing students.\n\"We ask a lot of our teachers, most of our class sizes average 20 to 20 plus students, so if you're asking them to improve reading or improve mathematics on top of being able to see if they're on cellphones it's a lot,\" Simmons said. \"With the pouches they don't have to be the cellphone police.\"\nAlthough schools don't yet have test scores back for last semester, the superintendent said pass rates have gone up with the cellphone pouches.\nDIFFICULTIES\nReception of the cellphone pouches has not been entierly positive among students and parents in the district, Simmons said.\nStudents have tried to tamper with or break into their pouches during the school day on multiple occasions.\n\"They're not indestructible, they're not the end all be all, but they are a great preventative tool to put in place,\" Simmons said. \"They're easy to tell if somebody's tampered with one, It's also easy to tell if a kid has their phone or has a phone out because they don't want their pouch or pouches to look empty.\"\nSome parents do not like the idea of the phone pouches because they prefer to have a direct line of communication with their child, Simmons said.\nStudents have not yet been polled on their feelings about the pouches, but the districts plans to weigh student attitudes toward the program in any future decisions made.\n\"I think overall, we're seeing a positive impact on the academics, on the social skills piece. If we asked kids if they'd rather have access to their devices, I'm sure they would,\" Simmons said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed sees initial budget proposal\n\n January 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 720\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot Board of Education had its first look at the district's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 Monday.During a board work session Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones presented the draft budget, which totals $85.8 million in unrestricted dollars — an $8.6 million increase from fiscal year 2025, Jones noted.\nJones provided the year-to-year budget changes by looking at 12 different categories of expenditures. The areas in which increases were highest are fixed charges ($2.23 million increase), instructional salaries ($1.7 million increase) and other instructional costs ($1.47 million increase).\nJones added that while $9 million to $10 million in grants are expected next year, anticipated grant funding is more than $5 million less than last fiscal year. That drop in grant funding precipitated a portion of the rise in the requested unrestricted budget.\nIn Annapolis, it still remains to be seen how Maryland's expected $2.7 billion deficit is tackled and if legislative decisions will impact funding for The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education improvement and funding initiative.\nTalbot school leaders say budgeting will be a fluid process in the coming months as they keep an eye on state legislation and the Accountability & Implementation Board, an entity that ensures the state and county governments are correctly implementing Blueprint.\n\"There's one area where I did do a little bit of hedging our bets, on the conservative side,\" Jones said of the proposed budget. \"I don't think we'll know any of that until April or May. But as certain pieces of legislation gather steam and seem to gather support and seem likely, then I think we will work behind the scenes to figure out how we will address this if this comes to fruition.\"\nIn creating the draft budget, Jones and Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi emphasized that the district considered its top priorities: academic equity in math, an engaging environment for students and staff, recruitment and retention levels, and meeting Blueprint objectives.\nMonday's discussion included a breakdown of 33 proposed additional positions for the next fiscal year. The proposed budget includes a $3.6 million jump in salaries and wages.\n\"This list is whittled down, if you can believe it, from a longer list of wants and desires,\" Jones said. \"And it was very much informed by school administration. This is what they felt they needed in their buildings.\"\nADDITIONAL POSITIONSJones outlined the 33 additional positions that are in the requested budget. Six of those positions are for English for Speakers of Other Languages teachers, assistants or coaches.\nShe cited the district's need to serve its multilingual population, along with the state funding for multilingual learning, for adding the positions.\n\"Our (Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program) data … demonstrates that we do consistently underserve our multilingual students,\" Jones said. \"And so, we just need to provide more resources there.\"\nBoard of Education President Emily Jackson asked if those English for Speakers of Other Languages positions will be difficult to fill.\n\"Because I know we've had problems — specifically with ESOL in the past — finding people who are qualified and had a desire to do that,\" Jackson said. \"And that's a quarter of the positions we're looking for.\"\nZulieka Jarmon-Horsey, assistant superintendent of administrative services, systems and strategies, said it's a challenge both in Talbot County and statewide. She said recruitment and retention are key aspects.\n\"We have to definitely start promoting earlier and just doing the best that we can,\" Jarmon-Horsey said. \"And doing things that are unconventional, like our on-site career fair that's going to be happening here this week.\"\nOther requested positions in the budget include: an art teacher at Easton Middle, a high school math coach, a middle school reading coach, four special education positions at Easton Elementary and a special education teacher at Easton Middle.\nOne athletic trainer to serve Easton High School and St. Michaels Middle High School was also on the proposed list.\n\"I'm happy to see that at the top of the list,\" Jackson said of the athletic trainer role. \"I would be in favor of two … making sure that we have coverage for all of our athletic events. I know sports parents, they have eyes on that.\"\nThe draft budget will be discussed again at Wednesday's monthly Board of Education meeting before the board hosts its joint meeting with the Talbot County Council on Jan. 22. On Feb. 10, the board will host a public hearing on the budget. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed adds makeup day for snow; approves 2025-26 calendar\n\n January 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 580\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — During Wednesday's meeting, the Talbot County Board of Education added a day onto the end of this year's school calendar following last week's snowstorm.Talbot County Public Schools was closed Monday through Friday last week due to snow that blanketed the Mid-Shore. However, the 2024-2025 school calendar only had four inclement weather days built in, meaning an additional day was needed to comply with the state's 180-day requirement.\nHelga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, recommended that a day be added in June, moving the last day of school for students to Friday, June 13.\nThe last day for teachers would be Monday, June 16. Einhorn said that historically, most teachers complete mandated training that affords them with not having to come in on the last day.\nThe board unanimously passed the adjusted calendar for this year.\n2025-26 CALENDAROn Wednesday, the board also chose the district's calendar for the 2025-2026 school year.\nAt last month's meeting, Einhorn presented a draft calendar with two days off in March and a five-day spring break, which was the recommendation of the calendar committee. Board President Emily Jackson, however, expressed frustration there weren't multiple options posed.\nThis month, Einhorn returned with three draft calendars. The first was similar to what the board saw in December, with a four-day weekend in March and the shorter spring break. The second draft removed the off days in March and had an eight-day spring break.\nA third draft included both the March break and an eight-day spring break, pushing the last student day back to June 10, 2026.\nAll three drafts included the typical days off in November for Easton's Waterfowl Festival, as well as a winter break from Dec. 20, 2025, to Jan. 4, 2026.\n\"There is no calendar that we're going to create that is best for every single person,\" Jackson said.\nJackson said it's clear — based on previous polling and community input — that most families favor the extended spring break. Board Vice President Amy Dodson suggested the board move forward with the second or third calendars.\nBoard member Karla Wieland-Cherry said she preferred the first calendar with the shorter spring break.\n\"You're losing a lot of school time for eight days off for students,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"You're losing a lot of momentum. And plus you're concerned with providing day care. Not all employers are going to allow that. That's quite a long time to take off of work and find day care and so forth.\"\nShe added that not all families are looking for a longer spring break.\n\"My only concern is that if 59% of our students are at the poverty level, we're really talking about more of a smaller group who are really going to financially be able to afford an Easter holiday,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"… You really could possibly potentially be causing more hardship for something that's more an elitist type thing, quite honestly.\"\nJackson said while she agrees with Wieland-Cherry's point, she has \"to go with what the community is saying.\"\n\"We have asked again and again, and the majority of the respondents to any time we've asked this have said they like that spring break,\" Jackson said.\nFollowing board discussion, Jackson motioned for approval of the third calendar featuring two off days in March and five days for spring break. Her motion included an amendment to the calendar that the March days off serve as two of four inclement weather days for the district.\nBy a 6-1 vote, with only Wieland-Cherry voting against, the board approved the 2025-2026 school year calendar. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore had decided to postpone implementing the experimental Blueprint for Maryland in our schools, due to the $2.7 billion deficit accrued by the state of Maryland.The Blueprint has been described as follows:\n\"It has taken the focus of schools off teaching students the academic and content knowledge they need to be successful adults in our society and made them 'one stop shopping' for services like medical, dental, nutritional, social engineering and mental health. It has promoted the implementation of 'restorative discipline' which has created a generation of students who are out of control and violent since there are no consequences for bad behavior. It has drained our schools of teachers as they flee to other states where working conditions are better even if the salaries are lower. These are just some of the negative impacts.\" (Easton Gazette, Dec. 20, 2024)\nHow disappointed was I to read in The Star Democrat (Jan. 15, 2025) that the Talbot Board of Education wishes to implement the Blueprint anyway, especially equity in math, with an $8.6 million increase to the school budget. With nearly 60% of Talbot County students (grades 3-8) showing a lack of proficiency in basic English language skills, while mathematics proficiency for Talbot County students stands at a dismal 17.2%, the last thing we need is for our children to be guinea pigs in yet another social experiment.\nWhat is equity in math? According to Edutopia: \"Math teachers can use short activities based on student goals related to equity in order to make classes feel more inclusive and accessible.\" The key words are \"feel\" \"inclusive\" and \"accessible.\"\nI was a sixth grader once, a sixth grader who hated math class. We had a strict teacher, of whom most of us were afraid. But we all learned to multiply and divide, in spite of the negative feelings, unlike, it appears, many of today's children who are not even being encouraged to memorize their times tables.\nThose negative feelings can give way to feelings of confidence and assurance when a subject has been mastered. I beg our educators to return to basics and stop making our children the latest casualties of yet another half-baked, ill-conceived progressive scheme for remaking society according to the designs of Karl Marx or Saul Alinsky.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Four winners are chosen: one early elementary student, one elementary student, one middle schooler and one high schooler.\nThis school year, the winners were:\nVienna Elementary second grader Adalynn Haugh.Hurlock Elementary third grader Kali Johnson.North Dorchester Middle eighth grader Elisabeth Claggett.North Dorchester High 10th grader Adrien Sinkeldam.\nTheresa Connors, the district's supervisor of English language learners, library media and fine arts, said the DCPS' central office staff loves getting to see the submissions and vote on their favorite every year. She said that each year the number of submissions gets larger.\n\"Even though they're supposed to screen them at the schools before they send them and choose their best, they send me more and more every year because it's hard for them to make a decision on what to send,\" she said. \"So it's very competitive.\"\nAs Connors read the names of each winner, the students got up from their chairs to accept a certificate and show off their designs, which included snowmen, Christmas trees and snow globes. Their teachers were also at the meeting to show support. Sinkeldam was not able to attend.\nAt the end of the meeting, Dorchester County Board of Education members and Superintendent Jymil Thompson talked about the students and their designs. Thompson said they did a \"fantabulous\" job.\n\"I just made that word up,\" he said, laughing. \"I really, really liked the cards. And everyone we sent the cards to liked the cards. ... They did a great job.\"\nBoard President Sheri Hubbard called it a \"wonderful time\" when students are recognized at board meetings.\n\"That's one of the best parts of this job,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In an email to The Star Democrat, the district said the arrest did not take place at the school.\nSchool and police officials say rumors of a parent being detained while dropping off a child at the elementary school are false.\nRepresentatives of the Easton Police Department added that the arrest was made due to outstanding warrants for an individual in town and not as a result of any directive from the new presidential administration. EPD officers were not involved in the arrest, but the department contacted the Department of Homeland Security following the incident as rumors began to circulate.\nAs of Monday, the Talbot school district had not communicated with families regarding the rumors, though counseling and mental health support for students, families and staff has been made available. TCPS' Director of Communications Debbie Gardner said in an email that the district has reviewed its existing protocols around \"actions or inquiries by law enforcement.\"\nLast week, State Superintendent Carey Wright sent a letter to Maryland superintendents outlining the practices school employees should take if immigration authorities enter schools.\n\"If federal immigration officials or law enforcement enter a school building seeking access to students (for interviews and/or questioning), school personnel should contact the local superintendent immediately for guidance,\" Wright wrote on Jan. 23.\n\"School personnel should not argue or debate with immigration enforcement officials but should direct them to the local superintendent or designated administrator for further action,\" the letter read.\nWright's letter comes as Donald Trump's immigration initiatives have brought sweeping policy changes since the inauguration last Monday.\nA directive last week from the Trump administration reversed a policy that established places such as schools, churches and shelters as \"protected areas.\" That policy discouraged immigration enforcement agents from conducting arrests in those areas.\n\"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest,\" Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Benjamine Huffman stated. \"The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.\"\nIn her letter, Wright said that if immigration officials request student records, local schools should consult with their attorneys.\n\"Personnel should immediately notify the student's parent or guardian if an immigration official or law enforcement officer requests or gains access to a student for immigration-enforcement purposes,\" Wright stated, \"unless such access was following a judicial warrant or subpoena that restricts the disclosure of the information to the parent or guardian.\"\nIn a statement, Talbot County Public Schools said that superintendents across the state had a meeting with Wright, as well as the Maryland ICE director. The district is following guidance from the Maryland Department of Education on immigration enforcement actions.\nRegarding the Easton arrest, a spokesperson for Enforcement and Removal Operations' Baltimore field office did not provide specific information on the arrest or if other arrests in the area have occurred in the past week. Enforcement and Removal Operations is a directorate of ICE.\n\"ERO Baltimore works daily to prioritize public safety by arresting and removing undocumented alien offenders who pose the greatest threat to our communities, to include those with serious criminal convictions who have violated our nation's immigration laws,\" an email statement read. \"By focusing on these high-priority cases, we aim to uphold the integrity of our immigration system while promoting the safety and security of Maryland's residents.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Currently, with carryover in funds from previous years, the estimated deficit is at $10.19 million.\n\"We've just got some difficult decisions to make as a district on how we're going to move forward with the current budget crisis that we're in,\" DCPS Superintendent Jymil Thompson said during a Dorchester County Board of Education budget work session Thursday.\nJodi Colman, district assistant superintendent of academics and student services, said the budget increases for fiscal year 2026 make it possible to keep the district's current staff in place.\n\"This would just be to basically maintain the programs that we have right now,\" she said about the draft budget. \"All of those increases were due to just keeping our staff that we have for the most part.\"\nThompson said \"a whole host of things\" has caused the deficit, mentioning fixed costs and unfunded mandates from the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and the quality of education across the state.\nBoard of Education Member Brandy Dawson Cumberland said that although the board likes a lot of what the Blueprint aims to do, there are \"certain unfunded mandates that are going to cut other things.\"\nThompson said the district is still waiting on exact numbers from the state and county. He said once they have those numbers, it is possible the deficit could be lower than $10.19 million.\n\"But I don't think that it will be higher than that,\" he said.\nSo far, the district has taken a number of actions to reduce the deficit, Thompson said. This includes:\nReducing some positions added with Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief fundingSending emails about non-essential spendingDeciding not to hire for vacated positionsReducing the central office custodian scheduleReducing student support monitorsMerging some job dutiesEliminating the education specialist position\n\"We did try to make some significant changes,\" Thompson said. \"And there's more that I didn't put up that we have done. But the reality is it's not enough.\"\nThe district is looking into more actions that can be taken to reduce the deficit. Some possible actions include revisiting who should have board vehicles, auditing and reducing the number of programs and platforms the district uses, revising overtime policies, sharing resources with the county and reducing staff.\n\"No one wants this one,\" Thompson said about reducing staff.\nWhile listing different \"cost containment options\" Thompson and board members made it clear that the district hasn't made any decisions yet, and is just looking at potential cost-cutting options.\n\"We are just at the beginning of starting to think about what things we can do to attack that number,\" Board of Education Vice President Talibah Chikwendu said.\n\"And that's why we really would like to have public input to know what the public feels are areas we should focus on if possible,\" Board President Sheri Hubbard said. \"Because we want to do what's best for kids, bottom line.\"\nThe Dorchester County Board of Education will host another budget work session on Feb. 13. It will also hold one in March. The district's proposed budget must be submitted to the county in June.\nBoard Member Chris Wheedleton said that if community members are able to do anything, they should talk with their representatives in Annapolis.\n\"Because we need their help,\" he said.\nThompson urged that this is the time to work together and not be divided.\n\"Because at the end of the day, we know that $10 million deficit that we're in, that's going to hurt the kids,\" he said. \"That's going to have a profound impact on how we can provide resources for our students.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Van Hollen talks federal grants pause with Eastern Shore legislators\n\n February 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 758\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n While speaking with Eastern Shore legislators Friday morning, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said a short-lived pause of federal funding earlier this week had impacts on local organizations such as fire stations and law enforcement agencies.Monday, President Donald Trump's budget office issued a memorandum ordering a pause on federal grants and loans. A U.S. district judge temporarily blocked the pause Tuesday before the White House rescinded the memo the following day.\n\"Because of the public outcry, they did pull back on this overall freeze,\" Van Hollen said. \"But there's still a whole lot of uncertainty and confusion. So if you are hearing from folks on the Eastern Shore that are recipients of federal programs that are being disrupted, please let us know.\"\nAt the weekly Eastern Shore Delegation meeting, Del. Steven Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) asked Van Hollen to elaborate on his perspective of what happened.\nVan Hollen said the memo from the Office of Management and Budget brought forth confusion for government agencies. The senator heard from thousands that were impacted, he said in an email newsletter.\n\"It was very broadly worded and very ambiguous,\" Van Hollen said. \"Federal agencies interpreted this based on what it said. Essentially, they did freeze a lot of ongoing payments to organizations that do important community work.\"\nArentz said some of the spending that was paused could be viewed as \"questionable\" in the first place.\n\"I think that's the point that was being made about that,\" Arentz said. \"I keep getting questions on it, because it does look like when you portray it in one way, it looks bad, but in the other way, you look at some spending that people would have questions on. And I think that's part of the explanation I try to give.\"\n\"The way the memo was worded and the reason it was retracted was because it was so broad that it appeared to impact everybody,\" Van Hollen responded.\nSen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) also attended Friday's Eastern Shore Delegation meeting. She explained to state senators and delegates her line of thinking when voting to confirm recent political appointees, emphasizing that she is prepared to vote on \"qualified\" candidates across party lines.\n\"My primary interest and sole interest, really, is making sure that I protect the interests of Maryland,\" Alsobrooks said.\nSUPERINTENDENTSEastern Shore superintendents gathered at the meeting Friday to provide legislative requests and recommendations.\nCaroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons, president of the Eastern Shore of Maryland Educational Consortium superintendents' group, framed Friday's discussion around The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education funding initiative.\nIt comes as Gov. Wes Moore (D) and the state legislature attempt to balance a $3 billion state deficit, in part by making cuts to education funding.\nDorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson explained the importance for districts to attract a diverse and qualified teacher workforce. However, state requirements, such as teacher salary minimums, sometimes bring about challenges.\n\"It is not good for a district, especially like mine, since we don't have the funding that other districts have,\" Thompson said.\nQueen Anne's County Public Schools Superintendent Patty Saelens said the Eastern Shore superintendents don't support Moore's proposed funding cuts to teacher collaborative time (out-of-classroom time to grade and plan) and community school initiatives.\n\"Our number one priority right now that we just can't support is literal cuts to our budget, specifically as it relates to the collaborative time and the community schools,\" Saelens said. \"Those are two major things that will negatively impact our overall state support.\"\nEDUCATIONRepresentatives from colleges and universities attended Friday's meeting, including Chesapeake College President Clifford Coppersmith and Washington College President Mike Sosulski.\nSosulski provided an update on Washington College's Innovation Plant Project, which is a project the institution is collaborating with Chesapeake College on.\n\"In the year-and-a-half of its development, it's already garnered $3 million in public and private funding to support it,\" Sosulski said.\nSosulski added that he hopes the Maryland Sellinger Grant Program, which provides independent colleges and universities with state funding, isn't slashed.\n\"I can't tell you how important Sellinger has been to making a Washington College education affordable and accessible to all Maryland residents,\" he said. \"It is really, and quite literally, the difference for many, many of our students and their ability to achieve the kind of education that we can provide.\"\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) asked about whether universities are considering raising tuition due to potential state funding cuts.\n\"We fully understand the need for the governor to cut the budget,\" said University of Maryland Eastern Shore President Heidi Anderson. \"We will not be looking at increasing tuition for our students, and we will abide by that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore and the state legislature aim to tackle a $3 billion deficit.Hiram Burch, the local government research and analysis manager for the department, shared that local governments across the state will have to pick up around $144 million of the gaps in the fiscal year 2026 budget as proposed.\nIn Caroline and Talbot counties, projected local cost shifts are in the $700,000 range. Dorchester County is at $830,000, while Queen Anne's County leads the pack for the Mid-Shore at $970,000. Kent is the lowest of the five counties with a $300,000 projection.\nMany of those cost shifts come in the education realm, including teacher retirement funding.\nDel. Steven Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) questioned whether record education funding that the governor's office has touted was due to the governor's actions or the result of The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's funding plan for education passed under former Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\"The governor's saying we have record funding to education,\" Arentz said. \"And I'm wondering if that's mandated from The Blueprint.\"\n\"Most education funding is formula-based,\" Burch said. \"He's required to put that in.\"\nBurch said while Moore did provide some \"enhanced funding,\" most of the state aid is required by formulas in The Blueprint.\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) said she's hearing from constituents that they're concerned about special education funding amid around $200 million in proposed cuts to the state Developmental Disabilities Administration.\nBurch said that none of the state aid reductions will affect special education.\n\"There were reductions in collaborative learning that impacted the foundation program, the compensatory aid program (and) the English language learners program, but this reduction did not affect special education funding,\" Burch said.\n\"That is the one area that has been held harmless by his proposed reductions and postponing the implementation of The Blueprint,\" he added.\nAt the close of Friday's budgetary discussions, Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said the state is \"very willing to pass unfunded mandates down to the counties.\"\n\"What this means really for Eastern Shore citizens, is their tax rates, their rates on their property, are going up,\" Adams said, referencing increasing property assessments. And that's how we're unfortunately going to be funding Maryland.\"\n\"That's my raw take on it, and many of our members are very concerned,\" Adams said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot school leaders discuss immediate, long-term effects of Blueprint cuts\n\n February 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 494\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Budget cuts in The Blueprint for Maryland's Future could have a potential impact of $1.7 million to Talbot County Public Schools this fiscal year, district officials said Monday.That gap is the amount of additional local funding the district may need if the governor's current budget proposal is passed, Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said to Board of Education members during Monday's work session.\nShe added that the impacts may snowball over the next eight years to the tune of more than $30 million in reduced funding from the state.\n\"These are deep cuts that are being proposed,\" Jones said.\nGov. Wes Moore filed the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act last month, a bill that proposes drastic cuts to education funding amid a nearly $3 billion state budget deficit.\nIf passed, the most significant cut would be a reduction in the \"per-pupil foundation\" funding outlined in The Blueprint's original formulas. In fiscal year 2026, it would reduce Talbot County's funding by $685,000, according to district calculations.\nThat's more than a third of the projected $1.7 million gap created by state cuts this year, which also includes reductions in compensatory education and multilingual learners funding, a decrease in the state's share of nonpublic special education tuition costs, and a hike in how much pension costs districts are required to pick up.\nDistrict Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the cuts to foundation funding per pupil, along with the slashes to compensatory and multilingual education, stand out. Superintendents across the state are continuing to advocate against the proposals, she said.\n\"While this excellence in education bill overall is saving money, it's still not hitting the foundation,\" Pepukayi said. \"That's the main push in the advocacy.\"\nThe superintendent said it's been conveyed that districts are expected to go back to counties \"to make up those expenses.\"\n\"That's all well and good if you live in Montgomery County or Prince George's County,\" Board Vice President Amy Dodson said. \"That doesn't really help us out here.\"\nDuring the meeting, Jones provided what the cumulative reductions in funding to Talbot County will be if the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act passes as proposed. For fiscal years 2026 through 2033, $20 million would be stripped from what the current Blueprint formulas outline for per-student funding.\nAdditionally, $9 million in compensatory education aid and $2.9 million in multilingual learner aid could be slashed over the next eight years, she said.\nBoard President Emily Jackson suggested board members begin their own advocacy amid the looming cuts.\n\"If we could, as a board, come together and talk about how we could take a stand here, I think that would be good,\" Jackson said. \"I think that would be a good first step in that direction.\"\nDodson added on, asking if members of the community could speak up, too.\n\"Do we want to get people in the community to write letters about this at this point? They're chopping our funding majorly,\" Dodson said. \"It seems like people in the community should also speak up, if they're so inclined.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed discusses dress code, school uniforms\n\n February 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 527\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot County Board of Education held a discussion during its virtual meeting Wednesday, touching on dress code updates and the possibility of implementing school uniforms.District Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi shared a revision to the district's administrative regulations for dress code. Administrative regulations do not require board approval.\nUnder the dress code standards, wording that singled out specific clothing items, such as \"low rider pants\" and \"spaghetti straps,\" was removed. The dress code largely remained unchanged aside from a few strikethroughs.\nBoard Member Ann O'Connor asked why some of the language was removed. Pepukayi said there were discrepancies of students getting coded, particularly in regards to body shape and size.\n\"Some of our administrators feel like they spend a lot of their day chasing down specific, indicated things in dress code,\" Board President Emily Jackson said. \"And it becomes a barrier to creating a relationship. And we feel like we are policing tiny little infractions all day long.\"\nThe board president later added that when it comes to dress code, she's in favor of standards that promote \"the dignity, and value and worth of each student\" rather than rules that police \"individual items of clothing.\"\nBoard Member Deborah Bridges said the revision \"guts what we had intended it to be.\"\nO'Connor said while she wasn't on the board for past discussions regarding dress code policy, she doesn't see a need for spaghetti straps to be permitted. She then raised the topic of school uniforms.\n\"In fact, I know this is probably not the way to bring it up, but I'm in full favor of school uniforms,\" O'Connor said.\nShe said uniforms would put everyone \"on the same playing field\" and \"solve all problems.\" O'Connor asked for it to be put on the table as an option.\nPepukayi said the topic of school uniforms has been discussed since she joined the district in 2022. Rochelle Eisenberg, the board's attorney, said the board does have the power to require school uniforms.\n\"You can have a policy requiring school uniforms so long as you would be willing to purchase them for children whose families could not afford them,\" Eisenberg said.\n\"I'm not opposed to uniforms,\" Board Vice President Amy Dodson said. \"I actually went to a high school that required uniforms, and I personally loved them as a student because I didn't have to think about what I was going to wear.\"\n\"I know the kids aren't in favor of this at all, but it would solve many problems,\" O'Connor said.\nEisenberg suggested no matter how the board proceeds, it should procure sufficient community input.\nJackson, who has been on the board since 2018, said the discussion of school uniforms has come up under past superintendents. She suggested the board look at past data and outcomes.\n\"I was told that it was once tried and it was not widely adopted, and it was very hard to enforce,\" Jackson said. \"I think that was at one of our elementary schools.\"\nPepukayi said talking with administrators and advisory committees can be a \"starting point.\"\n\"I'll talk to team members who've been here to get some historical context,\" Pepukayi said. \" … And then with current groups that we have, we'll formulate some questions and get some information.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Rooted Wisdom partners with Bloomberg for guided history walk at Adkins Arboretum\n\n February 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY — Adkins Arboretum and Beech Works are have been collaborating on the Rooted Wisdom Podcast for months. Now, they are working together on a similar project, but with a twist — Rooted Wisdom Walks.Rooted Wisdom Walks consists of audio walking guides for three trails at the arboretum. For listeners of the podcast, the voice sharing history along the 45-minute to hourlong walks will sound familiar.\nRooted Wisdom Walks historian Anthony Cohen guides the listeners through the trails.\nAccording to Rooted Wisdoms producers, Adkins Arboretum best shows natures' role in the Underground Railroad through its diverse landscape.\n\"Adkins is one of the few places where you can go and see examples from these narratives of the landscape in one place,\" George Burroughs, one of Rooted Wisdom Walks producers, said.\n\"It leverages Adkins as a place to come and try to understand and put yourself in the footsteps of a freedom seeker by observing what they might have observed.\"\nRooted Wisdom Walks offers a digital guide from Beech Works with technology supplied by the Bloomberg Philanthropies Connects app for mobile devices.\n\"We were looking for an app ... and what would work best for it,\" Burroughs said. \"There is not WiFi on a 400-acre forest. That's another issue. So we came across Bloomberg Philanthropies, and they developed this app, this platform for it, and it's downloadable.\"\nAnother big component of choosing the Bloomberg app is the ability to add pictures and videos to the audio, producers said.\n\"The key to with the Bloomberg Connects digital guide is that it's a multimedia platform. Like, we can put video in there,\" Burroughs said. \"We didn't do it for this one, but we put photographs that were taken by us and Adkins staff to help listeners identify what's being discussed.\"\nCohen travels with listens and stops at certain points in the trail to give a little background on what the listener is seeing at the park. But the recordings also give the listener some points of independence with the walk as well.\n\"There are times where there's something that matches that they're talking about specifically,\" Lauren Giordano, one of Rooted Wisdom Walks' producers, said. \"So visitors are prompted to walk to that space and then listen to the conversation there, and then the next stop there.\n\"They're walking and listening to the next segment of the conversation. So there are times where it's really kind of self-guided, but there's also a choice from the participant, where you can take more time at a spot for reflection.\"\nCohen believes that time gives listeners a chance to reflect on different wayfinding tactics that were used during the Underground Railroad.\n\"The probably far too simply put story of the Underground Railroad, or part of it, is the story of wayfinding,\" Cohen said. \"How do you get from point A to point Z and what propelled you along that journey?\"\nAdkins Arboretum helps tracks attendance via their map box and general attendance at the park each year.\nGinna Tiernan, executive director at Adkins, expects the arboretum will see an uptick in visitors with the new guided walks.\n\"We have a visitor center here. We have a map box outside that they could use,\" said Ginna Tiernan, executive director at Adkins. \"Of course we have a big, beautiful sign as well. Bloomberg did a fantastic job in allowing the producers to find just the right sign makers, and Lauren Giordano (producer) did all the graphics, fabulous icons that show you the way, what trail to take.\"\nWith Rooted Wisdom Walks, listeners don't have to be at the park to experience the audio. They can also just listen at home.\nThe producers credit Cohen's creativity and knowledge of history to making to audio captivating.\n\"You have people that know the history, and it's very hard to find people that can help you experience it a bit and get you connected to it,\" Burroughs said. \"But what Tony does so well is the connective tissue in between that someone needs to be conduit and facilitate, and that's what Tony does best.\n\"That's the experiential history part, we haven't been on anything else around any other subject, where someone performs the work that Tony does, and they and provides that unique perspective that he does.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Mrs. Hollis was my compass,’ my true north': Pioneering educator and community activist dies at 97\n\n February 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DOUG BISHOP | Section: News \n \n 479\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — Madelyn Matthews Hollis, 97, a dedicated educator who taught for more than three decades in Queen Anne's County schools and became a steadfast community advocate, died Thursday, Feb. 20, while under care at Compass Hospice in Centreville.Born in Accomack County, Virginia, Hollis arrived in Centreville in 1948 when she was hired by then-Superintendent Harry Rhodes to teach mathematics at Kennard High School, which served African American students during segregation.\nHollis taught at Kennard until 1966, when segregation ended in Queen Anne's County. She then transferred to Queen Anne's County High School, where she taught mathematics and driver's education until her retirement in 1981 after 33 years in education.\n\"She was a really good teacher,\" said former student Naimbi Davis of Centreville. \"She was not a coddler with students. However, she knew how to teach them. Math was never my subject, but Mrs. Hollis taught me the essentials.\"\nBeyond her teaching career, Hollis was deeply involved in community service. She was an active member of New Life United Methodist Church in Centreville and served as president of the Lucretia Kennard Homemaker's Club for at least 16 years.\nPerhaps her most enduring legacy came through her fierce advocacy to preserve the former Kennard High School building when it faced demolition after closing. That preservation effort, spearheaded by Hollis and carried forward by alumni, culminated in the 2019 dedication of the Kennard African American Cultural Center and Museum.\nClayton Washington, who led the alumni restoration efforts, said, \"Mrs. Hollis was 'my compass,' my true north. She kept me on point. She always told me, 'Boy, don't start something you can't finish!' When we dedicated the Kennard African American Center in May 2019, I was pleased I could say to her, 'We got it done!' I know she was happy.\"\nFrom 1985 to 1995, Hollis served on the Queen Anne's County Public Schools Board, appointed by then-Maryland Governor Harry Hughes. During her tenure, she was instrumental in establishing Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday as a school holiday in the county.\nFormer board colleague Elizabeth Broderick described Hollis as \"an icon of the community\" who \"went to college earning her teaching degree when going to college was not open to everyone, especially African American women.\"\nHollis was known for her strong Christian faith and believed that prayer in schools taught students respect for \"a higher being\" that could be applied to all aspects of life.\nHer former classroom at the Kennard African American Cultural Center features her picture, her name, and writing on the blackboard in her handwriting—a tribute to \"living history.\"\n\"She was one of my favorite teachers,\" said Jim Brown, a Kennard High School graduate and former Grasonville Community Center President. \"I'd say she was a very kind Christian lady, who was devoted to her church, Kennard, and her work with the NAACP. I say she was a community activist.\"\nA Celebration of Life will be held later in March. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — Last week, the Commissioners of St. Michaels introduced an ordinance would allow St.Michaels Middle High School to have an illuminated sign outside of the school.The potential sign would bring more attention to events and announcements of school activities, proponents argued.\nSt. Michaels Middle High School students attended the introduction of the ordinance. Senior Phoebe Cole and junior Kyle Murphy spoke about how important an illuminated sign would be for the school.\n\"I think that having this big noticeable sign with the information of our games, half days and just school information, it would bring a lot more people to our school and a lot more revenue to our school,\" Cole said.\nWhile Cole discussed what the potential new sign would do, Murphy mentioned how the current sign doesn't grab anyone's attention.\n\"I don't think I've ever noticed a piece of information on that sign that is currently there,\" Murphy said. \"It's a waste of our administration and teachers time going out there putting out information that is just not being read. With this sign they can just change the information from a computer.\"\nCole and Murphy both talked about the exposure it would bring to the school and the town, which could get community members out to athletic games and school plays.\nThe town officials suggested that a change in the ordinance to allow the town to be able to announce other events besides school events on the sign. This change would allow other announcements beside school announcements to be made.\nThe officials also suggested changing the ordinance name from educational facilities to public school. This allows the town to control the amount of facilities that would need an illuminated sign.\nThe town government decided to move the ordinance to a second meeting, which would be a public hearing. The meeting is slated for the second town meeting in March. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

County officials say they've heard for years about the need for new lights.\nThe project will cost $817,000, just over half of a total $1.5 million to be pulled from the county's capital projects fund. Talbot County's fiscal year 2025 budget has already accounted for the costs.\n\"That's huge for the auditorium,\" County Council President Chuck Callahan said. \"So I'm glad that went through. That's going to be big for the school.\"\nCouncil members also unanimously approved $556,000 for light replacements at St. Michaels Middle High School and $116,000 for athletic field improvements across the district.\nFollowing those approvals, the County Council passed a bill permitting the county's sale of bonds to borrow $26.9 million for Chapel District Elementary School renovations. That funding from the county spans both fiscal years 2025 and 2026.\nThe renovation project, which broke ground last August, will upgrade the existing building and add on an additional 16,000 square feet. Chapel Elementary was last renovated in 1994.\nCallahan said Talbot County Public Schools Director of Operations Kevin Shafer has done a \"phenomenal job\" leading renovation efforts.\n\"You've done excellent keeping us up to speed and everything, and trying to keep everything on budget,\" Callahan said. \"We really, really appreciate it. It's huge for the community down there too.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The officials decided on a post Labor Day start for the new school year.Tara Downes, assistant to the superintendent, came before the Caroline County Board of Education at the March 4 board meeting. A survey was sent out to parents and staff on what start of school day was preferred.\nAccording to the survey, pre Labor Day start of school calendar was preferred by staff and parents in Caroline County, but survey officials felt from conversations with parents that the post Labor Day calendar was preferred.\n\"What I have heard has not been this,\" Board Member Chrissy Bartz said. \"Some feedback I've received is that its not their preference.\"\nThe board members discussed what factors played into each calendar to make their decision. Teachers having a longer break was one of the deciding factors.\n\"I worry about our teachers coming back that early and have a full July of summer camp and kids in building,\" Bartz said. \"I think if we could give them a few more days and have that long weekend available for families, I am hearing families would prefer that.\"\nFor the 2025-26 school year calendar the first day of school is slated to be Tuesday, Sept. 2. Teachers will return to the building on Aug. 25 to begin planning for the new school year.\nColonel Richardson High School is set to hold graduation on May 27, 2026, and North Caroline High School is set to hold graduation on May 28, 2026.\nThe last day of school for students is June 17, and the last day for teachers is slated for the day after.\nThe county has three inclement weather days accounted for in the calendar for the new school year. In the 2024-25 school year calendar, there were four inclement weather days, and all four have been used to account for snow this winter.\n\"The board can always change the number of snow days that we build in,\" Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"The board always has the ability to take certain days that are not state required days, we just have appeal to the state.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Rachael Whiting, the Eastern Shore affiliate's vice chair and lead mentor, said Easton High's project featured trains, buses, ferries and cars as well as trails and bike paths.\nSt. Michaels Middle High School's project, complete with an arcade, mini golf and go-karts, aimed to expand recreation in St. Michaels, Whiting said.\nSaints Peter and Paul High School's project was called \"Connecting Delmarva.\"\n\"They did a train station with 11 different stops along the Eastern Shore, connecting Maryland and Delaware,\" Whiting said.\nProjects judges included Aaron Goller with Easton Utilities, Jason Loar with Davis, Bowen & Friedel and Jay Yerkes with Rosin Creek Collaborative.\nWhiting said last week's ceremony included a dinner and a keynote speech from Casey Rauch of Rauch Inc.\nEaston High School engineering and business teacher Nicholas Werner was awarded the ACE Community Award. He called the award \"wonderful.\"\n\"It's just a great opportunity for the kids,\" he said about the program. \"I think my biggest part is being the cheerleader for them here.

In 2019, community schools were introduced as part of The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's initiative to fund and improve education.\nMore than 600 Maryland schools are community schools. Two are in Talbot County: Easton Elementary and Easton Middle. Those schools receive extra funds to create services for students and families in poverty.\nAs future funding remains up in the air this legislative session, Talbot County's two community schools are moving forward at two different stages of the process.\nLast school year, Easton Elementary came up with an implementation plan and goals. Those goals are to increase availability of healthy foods, provide mental health resources, raise enrichment by 15%, and add 100 students to the school's Choptank Community Health partnership, Fox said.\nFox, a longtime teacher before taking on her current role, said those needs become apparent.\n\"You could probably spot test any single classroom teacher. All of those things spike up,\" Fox said. \"Food insecurity, needing materials, clothing. All of that is prevalent in all of the spaces, especially post-pandemic.\"\nEaston Elementary is in its third year as a community school. Starting off, the school received state funding to hire Fox's position and a health care practitioner. In Year 3, it received \"per-pupil\" funding to begin providing specific services and resources.\nFox said the per-pupil funding has supported before- and after-school programs and Teddy Bear Fresh Produce boxes for family events, among other programs.\nEaston Middle, meanwhile, is in its first year. Community school facilitator Shelby Parks is spearheading a needs assessment that includes staff, family, student and community surveys.\nAt the middle school, Parks says mental health, food insecurity and transportation are focus areas.\n\"We can't offer too many after-school programs because we just don't have the transportation, and students are struggling,\" Parks said.\nFox noted that transportation to grocery stores for neighborhoods around Easton Elementary and Easton Middle is a challenge.\n\"We don't have a current grocery store that's within walking distance, so that's just something to consider,\" Fox said. \"If the family doesn't have their own personal transportation, it makes it more difficult to access any kind of healthy food outside of a few restaurants that are there.\"\nFUNDING UNCERTAINTY\nAttempting to close a nearly $3 billion state deficit, Gov. Wes Moore proposed a budget in January with significant cuts and freezes to education funding, including for community schools. Many education advocates pushed back.\nHis budget proposed freezing community school funding at next year's levels, potentially impacting the money provided to schools such as Easton Elementary in future years.\nBut last week, the House of Delegates amended some of Moore's education cuts by passing a refined Blueprint education bill. The House struck through his proposed pause to community school funding and sent the bill to the Senate chamber.\nKristen Tilghman, Blueprint implementation coordinator for Talbot County Public Schools, said the district is watching closely to see if community school funding is paused or affected in any way.\nThe district is \"going to move forward because our community clearly has a need,\" Tilghman added. Easton High, White Marsh Elementary and Tilghman Elementary are the district's schools next in line to become community schools. Job postings for community school program leaders are active for those three schools.\nTilghman said the state funding \"sets the stage\" for schools to create partnerships and assist families all over Talbot County.\n\"(It's) vital to the whole community, not just that particular school's community,\" she said.\n'HELPING ALL'\nTalbot school leaders emphasized that theme of not just helping the designated community schools but bettering the entire district.\nFor instance, Fox is involved in monthly food distributions for families across the district, not just Easton Elementary.\n\"Because we're a small county, I can do this heavy lift at Easton Elementary, but Easton Middle and High and Chapel (District Elementary) and Tilghman (Elementary) can benefit from some of the things that are happening,\" she said.\nAs Parks prepares to move EMS into the implementation phase next year, she's watching how Fox makes an impact at the elementary school.\n\"I'm excited that if Easton High comes on board, we can see trends between Easton Elementary, Easton Middle and Easton High, how it all flows, how we all work together,\" Parks said.\nThe concept of working together applies not just for every school in Talbot County, but for every student in each school. Fox said all students benefit from the community school resources and programs.\n\"You create something for one, it always ends up helping all,\" Fox said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Five years ago, Tamara Forte was in her 15th year of teaching first grade. On Friday, March 13, teachers were told to pack up their classrooms as if for summer vacation, covering items with bulletin board paper. They thought it would be for only two weeks.\"The fear of the unknown was big,\" Forte said. \"We were closing the school buildings but had no idea what the future would hold and how long it would be for.\"\nConditions were constantly changing, with teachers having little control or input. After closing for two weeks, teachers learned they would have to send learning packets home. Some parents printed the packets through email, while others picked them up at school. Staff members delivered packets to students' homes when necessary.\nForte admits having to ask colleagues for help recalling some details of what they went through five years ago.\n\"It was a blur, and I blocked many details out. It was a hard, worrisome time,\" she said. Her day care closed after she had paid weeks to hold her spot. \"My day care had closed; my work had closed. It felt like the world was closing down.\"\nAt home, Forte watched videos on properly cleaning and disinfecting groceries, even cereal boxes, as she moved them between counters. She balanced keeping her family safe while maintaining her teaching responsibilities.\nTeachers continued being flexible and adapting to unprecedented circumstances. Forte's sister traveled from New Jersey to help create a classroom in her basement. With a laptop and projector, teachers did their best to make virtual learning engaging.\nThey learned to conduct Zoom calls and waited patiently while students searched for misplaced pencils. Teachers virtually entered all their students' homes, observing family members engaged in various online activities that sometimes created distractions. Some students struggled without tech-savvy family members to assist them, while others, including Forte's own school-aged sons, had to learn to log in and out at specific times for whole group and small group instruction.\nTeachers spent considerable time troubleshooting frozen screens and internet glitches. Some created paper cutouts of themselves and mailed them to students with inspiring messages. They organized a school parade, decorating their cars with \"we miss you\" messages and driving through neighborhoods to wave and honk at their students. Teachers created grade-level photo collages with encouraging messages.\nWhen fall arrived, teachers returned to schools without students. They prepared pizza boxes full of materials for at-home use and distributed computers and hot spots to families in need. Before students could return, teachers learned to space desks 6 feet apart, marking the distance with tape.\nStudents gradually returned to school on rotating A/B schedules. Teachers simultaneously instructed in-person and at-home students. They observed children biting wet masks or dropping them on the floor before putting them back on. Physical expressions of encouragement like hugs and high-fives were no longer possible.\n\"Reflecting on teaching and life in the pandemic really makes you appreciate every smile, hug, high-five, and all the learning together,\" Forte said. \"It makes you cherish the many things that we take for granted every day. I never want to go back to this time.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Schools struggle to bridge learning gaps, adapt to a new normal\n\n March 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 726\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Five years after COVID-19 upended classrooms, Mid-Shore school districts are still working to close learning gaps, combat chronic absenteeism and adapt to lasting changes in education. While academic performance is improving across Maryland, with more schools earning top ratings, districts continue to wrestle with pandemic-era challenges — particularly in student engagement, virtual learning access and social-emotional development.\"We continue to see some gaps in students' learning,\" said Queen Anne's County Public Schools Superintendent Patricia Saelens, emphasizing the district's focus on tutoring, academic intervention and social-emotional strategies. Yet chronic absenteeism remains high, with some counties reporting rates above 25%, and virtual learning remains a logistical hurdle due to disparities in technology access.\nDespite the challenges, local educators say students have proven resilient, with many now excelling in academics and careers. The post-pandemic education system may look different, but its impact on today's students will be felt for years to come.\nLEARNING GAPSMaryland's most recent education report indicated steady improvements in school performance, with 91 schools achieving five-star ratings in the 2023-24 school year, up from 85 the previous year. About 41% of schools statewide received a four- or five-star rating, marking a gradual increase. However, despite these gains, schools statewide still fell short of meeting annual targets in every category.\nTo address learning gaps, Queen Anne's County Public Schools have expanded tutoring services where funding is available. Additional intervention programs in reading and math aim to support struggling students. Saelens stressed the need for continued focus on social-emotional learning, ensuring that students feel connected and ready to learn.\nCHRONIC ABSENTEEISMOne of the most persistent challenges post-COVID is chronic absenteeism, according to state Department of Education data. While attendance rates have improved since the height of the pandemic, absenteeism remains above 25% across the Mid-Shore:\nQueen Anne's County: 22.9%Kent County: 26%Caroline County: 28%Talbot County: 28.5%Dorchester County: 38.3%\nMatt Evans, supervisor of Student Services in Queen Anne's County said their district was already experiencing a slight increase in chronic absenteeism prior to the pandemic; however, that rate significantly increased during COVID-19 school closures and peaked during the 2021-2022 school year. Since then, the chronic absenteeism rate is on a steady decline but not back to the pre-pandemic rates, Evans said.\nHome instruction numbers also were increasing prior to the pandemic, with the sharpest increase and peak during the 2020-2021 school year. After 2020-2021, the home instruction numbers significantly decreased and ultimately plateaued, although they are not back to the pre-pandemic numbers, he noted.\nStatewide, officials are working to reengage students but lingering effects of pandemic-related disruptions continue to impact attendance.\nVIRTUAL LEARNINGVirtual learning, once an emergency measure, remains a complex issue. While some districts have successfully integrated online instruction for inclement weather closures, Queen Anne's County faces challenges in fully adopting virtual learning due to technology and connectivity limitations.\n\"In the state of Maryland, virtual learning days must adhere to all the guidelines of MSDE,\" Saelens said. \"Not all QACPS students have a one-to-one device, and unfortunately, we still have pockets throughout the district where internet connectivity is challenging.\"\nAdditionally, some teachers struggle with reliable internet access, making a full-scale virtual learning model unfeasible.\nADOPTION AND INNOVATIONDespite the setbacks, educators see lasting benefits from the changes forced by the pandemic. Kent County Public Schools Superintendent Mary Boswell-McComas noted that five years is a significant portion of a student's educational journey.\n\"A fifth grader in 2020 is now well into their high school years. Elementary school students today don't remember the pandemic and wearing masks,\" she said.\nWhile routines have returned to pre-COVID norms, teachers and students have become more proficient with technology. Virtual instruction, once foreign, is now a tool used strategically during weather-related closures.\nFederal funding post-pandemic helped schools innovate, including the implementation of student support coaches in Kent County classrooms. These coaches allow teachers to work with students in smaller groups, providing targeted academic support and aiding in social-emotional development.\nA NEW CHAPTERAs districts continue to navigate post-COVID realities, educators emphasize resilience and adaptation. Students who graduated during the pandemic are now succeeding at competitive universities and in the workforce, proving that the disruptions, while significant, did not define their futures.\n\"The pandemic was a challenging and troubling time for all of us: in schools, in our communities and around the world,\" Kent County's Boswell-McComas said. \"As with so many challenges, we have come out of it stronger. We learned more about ourselves and have incorporated innovative techniques that are still in use today.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We're having budget meetings on a weekly basis. We're talking to our team consistently with the board. We're trying to make the best decision possible for Dorchester County Public Schools, and it's not easy.\"\nWhile giving a budget update at the meeting, Thompson said the district will be looking into reducing its staff by 12 to 24 positions. He said those layoffs could save the district between $900,000 and $1.8 million.\n\"There are no definitive positions that we have identified as of yet,\" he said. \"But we will be moving forward to doing that at our next meeting.\"\nThompson said the district has been in conversation with district principals, Dorchester Educators, Dorchester Educators Education Support Professionals and the Dorchester Administrators and Supervisors Association to discuss where those staff reductions could be made.\nThompson said the district wants to retain as many staff as possible and minimize the impact on teaching and learning.\n\"If we want to get from 23 to 15, we can't afford to lose teachers,\" he said about the district's state rating. \"We have to make sure that we keep our class sizes small and keep teachers at all costs. And we're trying to do what's best for everyone.\"\nThompson said the district is reviewing attrition rate trends. He said he believes the number of teachers who leave the district for retirement and other reasons at the end of the school year will help.\n\"And we may not have to reduce as many staff,\" he said. \"But we will have to reduce some staff.\"\nAlong with looking into staff reductions, Thompson said the district will be opening up negotiations with its staff representatives, which include Dorchester Educators, Dorchester Educators Education Support Professionals and the Dorchester Administrators and Supervisors Association.\n\"And the reason is because we cannot currently honor the step increases and the (cost of living adjustment),\" he said.\nThompson said the district could potentially save $3.5 million through these negotiations. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Teacher for a Day brings community into the classroom\n\n March 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lilly Howard lhoward@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 808\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Community members were behind teachers' desks this week thanks to the \"Teacher for a Day\" event organized by the Education Foundation of Cecil County Public Schools at schools across the county.\"Our goal here at Rising Sun was for our teacher of the day to see several different classrooms and different teaching styles,\" Rising Sun Elementary School Principal Sherri Isaac said.\nVarious business leaders and community members visited elementary schools, middle schools and high schools throughout the county from March 3 to 13.\nJosh Hayhurst of Superdojo Martial Arts had participated in the former \"Principal for a Day\" at Rising Sun Elementary but found this experience to be more fruitful as he got to attend both Rising Sun and North East elementary schools — the largest elementary schools in the county — and sit in on classes, and facilitate a gym class for a more immersive day.\nIsaac enjoyed this initiative more than any other.\n\"I feel like our teacher for the day got to experience more of what educators do than when he was following me around for a day,\" Isaac said.\nHayhurst spent time with each elementary grade in both schools to see the full scope. He pointed out that — contrary to the popular narrative of low test scores reflecting badly on CCPS — \"these kids were ridiculously good readers and the teachers are rockstars.\"\nHayhurst said that he sees a lot of the same kids at his Superdojo, so he enjoyed being able to connect with them both in a space outside of martial arts. At Superdojo, he focuses on taking abstract ideas like how to create a positive environment and making them relevant in his teaching of martial arts, which he brought into facilitating the gym class with a fun twist on a jump rope activity.\nHayhurst also brought dry erase markers to replace the dried up ones for a teacher, and created \"reading buddies\" — pom poms with googly eyes — to make reading activities more fun for the kids. His efforts to bring in new elements made a positive impact on the students and the faculty.\n\"Go into the classroom and believe that you're a leader and you can make a difference with the kids just by being a positive role model,\" Hayhurst said.\nHe was impressed with the students' math abilities. He joined in on a multiplication table competition doing as many problems as quickly as possible, thinking he would win. But to his surprise, \"I look up and there's a girl that had been finished for like 10 seconds just looking at me like, 'What took you so long,'\" Hayhurst said.\nHayhurst valued the opportunity to connect with students and teachers and encouraged others to do the same.\n\"That connection is really important, and we've lost it in our community. We don't even know who our neighbors are, but we can find our neighbors in our local schools, and everybody, I think, should be a part of the schools,\" Hayhurst said.\nDarius Humphries with Chesapeake Care Resources said he enjoyed his time at Elkton Middle School where he sat in on a math class where the teacher pushed the students to think critically and strategize. He plans to volunteer more with public schools in the future because of his experience with \"Teacher for a Day.\"\nSchool officials said that situations such as these were the goal of the entire experience.\n\"We really just wanted our community to see what goes on, the amazing things that go on in our school every day and see what the kids are learning,\" Isaac said.\nNick LaBrant with Utilitrain had the opportunity to teach a Cherry Hill Middle School social studies class about the history of power lines. With an informative presentation and power line props, LaBrant immersed himself as a teacher.\n\"It was actually an incredible class,\" LaBrant said. \"I was able to give the students a little bit of an industry insight on something that really matters in the class.\"\nThe students had just learned about the history of railroads, so LaBrant's presentation fit right into the curriculum. LaBrant also educated students about soft skills necessary for the work force.\n\"I know that they're still in middle school, but I got to talk to them about teamwork and accountability and integrity from someone who's been out in the industry,\" LaBrant said.\nLaBrant added that he was impressed with the students' engagement with his lesson.\n\"For every student to be paying attention, have questions, remaining engaged, I think it says a lot of good things about our public school system here in Cecil County,\" LaBrant said.\nAs a parent himself, this initiative reminded LaBrant to get more involved in Cecil County schools, while seeing how much patience and gratitude the teachers have toward their students to be successful.\n\"We would welcome an opportunity to have another 'Teacher for a Day' next year and hope that people continue to take advantage of it,\" Isaac said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Plan to require school uniforms doesn't gain traction with Talbot Board of Ed\n\n March 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 453\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A proposal to institute school uniforms in Talbot County failed to advance at last week's Board of Education meeting.Board member Ann O'Connor, who first raised the uniform topic at a meeting last month, made a motion to institute school uniforms. However, that motion did not carry, as none of the other six board members seconded.\nBefore the failed motion, Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi shared results of a community survey with the board. Nearly 1,900 responses were recorded — 74% of those coming from parents, 15% from staff and 8% from students.\nOverall, around 49% opposed school uniforms, with 45% in favor and the remaining voting no opinion. Responses varied based on the grade level:\nElementary school: 49% in favor, 41% opposed.Middle school: 49% in favor, 42% opposed.High school: 44% in favor, 48% opposed.\nO'Connor said after one year of implementation, there could be a school shop with \"hand-me-down\" uniforms. She said purchasing uniforms wouldn't be \"an exorbitant expense.\"\nVice President Amy Dodson disagreed.\n\"If you have a family that is only making minimum wage, it's a significant expense,\" Dodson said. \"And you have a significant portion of our student population that is on free and reduced meals.\"\nBoard member Dyshekia Strawberry said she doesn't see the need to introduce uniforms since the survey didn't show \"an overwhelming response either way.\" President Emily Jackson concurred.\n\"I don't see an overwhelming need to make a major change in policy and procedure,\" Jackson said. \"Combined with the fact that, again, we are in a challenging budget year, and this would be an expensive undertaking should we go forward with it.\n\"Those two factors combined leave me not compelled to do anything in this regard.\"\nO'Connor said she was surprised by the high response rate. She told The Star Democrat she'd like the district to gather information on the impacts of uniforms at other schools and potentially revisit the topic next school year.\nIn an interview Friday, Pepukayi said she was surprised by both the high survey response rate and \"the closeness of the percentages that came out with elementary and middle\" school questions.\nThe superintendent said her team discussed the cost factors around having parents pay for uniforms, though they did not get into what specifics costs may be if the district assumed uniform payments.\nPepukayi said potentially helping families pay for school uniforms would bring up questions of which families the district helps and how that's determined.\n\"That's another discussion because then where do you draw the line?\" she said.\nPepukayi said she doesn't expect the topic of uniforms to come up again anytime soon.\n\"It didn't get the second (to) the motion, so it kind of died right there on the spot. But that's not to say it couldn't come up again,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Education workers empty their offices after recent layoffs\n\n April 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JADE TRAN and JESS DANINHIRSCH Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1041\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Suitcases and large cardboard boxes rolled across the pavement outside the Department of Education's offices last week as recently fired federal workers packed up their desks.Waiting outside, workers were greeted with claps, cheers and whistles as they emerged from the buildings, some raising their fists in defiance. Colleagues embraced, sharing quiet words or simply holding on. Signs with various messages floated above the crowd, most thanking the workers for their public service.\nWhat began as a smaller \"clap out\" outside the Office of the State Superintendent of Education, home to Free Application for Federal Student Aid offices, on Wednesday grew into a larger demonstration by Friday. Fired employees gathered at the Department of Education's headquarters, joined by advocates rallying in solidarity.\nAbout two weeks ago, workers in the department, which originally had 4,200 employees, began to hear rumblings of a large round of layoffs aimed at reducing the workforce by 50%. Some employees opted for early buyouts, while others took early retirements. The remaining 1,300 employees were subject to \"reduction in force\" notices, according to former employees Nikki Churchwell, of Calvert County, Maryland, from the Office of Performance and Improvement, and Kaitlyn Vitez, of Alexandria, Virginia, from the Office of Communications and Outreach.\nThe U.S. Office of Personnel Management lays out specific procedures for downsizing, which include ranking employees based on seniority and performance. However, Churchwell said the administration altered the way competitive areas were identified to bypass this process.\nVeronica Greene, 56, a nearly retired worker, made her way down the path outside the state superintendent's office, her belongings packed into two cardboard boxes stacked on a dolly. A security guard and another man, also carrying boxes, helped guide the load.\nA car pulled up to the corner of the building, its windows down. A man and a woman inside waved and clapped in support. With teary eyes, Greene said, \"These are my colleagues.\"\n\"We party hard. We love each other. It's hard to see these people leave because I don't know if I'll ever see them again, \" she said. \"Some I might, but a lot I might not.\"\nDescribing her experience, Greene said that she planned to retire, but this departure was not on her own terms. In just 15 to 20 minutes, the place she had considered home for decades was reduced to two boxes, after dedicating her life to student aid and loan services since 1991.\nHer days were spent answering phones and sorting through mail, but it was in her office in meetings, where she said she witnessed the dedication of her colleagues.\nKelisa Wing, of Virginia, a former employee with the Office of the Deputy Secretary at the Department of Education, was escorted to her workstation around 9 a.m. on Friday with just 30 minutes to pack up her belongings.\nAs she moved through the office, she noticed Homeland Security personnel monitoring the building. By 11 a.m., the walls of her workspace, once decorated with family photos, potted plants and an image of Martin Luther King Jr. from the night before his assassination, were bare.\nEverything had been carefully placed into a sleek black suitcase with a box stacked on top.\n\"All I ever wanted to be was an English teacher and look what God did, because of education,\" she said. \"Education saved my opportunities, so that's what they want to take away.\"\nThough for Wing, the moment was bittersweet. The abrupt departure offered a sense of closure, giving her the chance to say a proper goodbye to colleagues she had worked alongside for years.\n\"This is an assault on public education, because people know that education is the great equalizer,\" she said. \"It is the way that a student, a person like me, who came from nothing from Toledo, Ohio, from nothing, can end up working in a place like this.\"\nSupporters gathered with former employees, holding signs of solidarity. One sign, adorned with Sesame Street's Cookie Monster, read: Thank you! Gracias! Merci! Salamat!\nTony Sarmiento, a retired worker from Silver Spring, Maryland, who has attended 21 demonstrations in support of federal employees since the new administration took office, stood beside Greene, snapping photos and helping her with her belongings.\nHe said firings like these often lead to deep emotional struggles, with laid-off workers battling depression and self-blame.\n\"So, even with the completely irrational, cruel way these closings are happening,\" he said, \"there's a phenomenon where workers are so depressed, they aren't going to blame the right person.\"\nBill Bimber, a retired science and technology high school teacher with 34 years of experience in northern Virginia schools, spent many years without computers to teach his students computer repair. If it weren't for funding programs created by the Department of Education, he may never have received computers to teach his class.\nBimber expressed his concerns that if the department is experiencing massive layoffs, programs like this that provide equipment and materials to students may no longer get off the ground.\n\"I know how programs from this agency, this department, have affected schools over the years, and it's largely invisible, but it's huge,\" Bimber said. \"It really is enormous what they do.\"\nDressed in a Department of Education graphic T-shirt, Jackie Murray approached her firing with grace — after 40 years in communications and outreach — with a positive outlook on her future. After being placed on administrative leave over two months ago, the popular Murray bounced around the outside of the building with a smile and laughter.\nShe responded to a question about her next steps, saying, \"My mouth moves a lot, so it needs to get paid because it has to eat, you know.\"\nFor her, a support system of girlfriends, music, and scripture was key during moments like this that felt shared by many federal workers across the Washington region.\n\"Find you a support group that has accepted this, because there are still individuals, um, that I know who have not fully accepted this,\" she added, offering advice to those in her situation.\nIn the coming days, there will be debates about what form the department should take and how programs should be implemented, Vitez said.\n\"At the end of the day, we need to do what's best for schools … and for students and provide them the most resources and support to get the job done,\" she said. \"And people need more support, not less.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "University of Delaware asks state for $43.5 million to build Biden Hall, renovate labs\n\n April 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 654\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The University of Delaware is asking the state legislature for $43.5 million for capital projects, including building Biden Hall and renovating aging laboratories.\"These requests all support our overarching goal of meeting the educational goals of Delawareans who are coming to UD with greater financial need,\" UD President Dennis Assanis said Thursday during his annual capital budget request to the state legislature's Joint Capital Improvement Committee.\nThe committee, commonly referred to as the bond bill committee, hears capital budget requests from various state agencies and later will finalize the budget and send it to the full legislature for a vote in late June.\nUD is asking for $20 million to help build Biden Hall, an interdisciplinary social sciences building named after UD's most famous alumnus. The money is already in Gov. Matt Meyer's budget recommendation.\nUD first publicly disclosed plans for Biden Hall in January, but details remain scarce. Assanis revealed in his presentation to the bond bill committee that the building has been in the planning stages since 2018.\n\"We're still very much in the fundraising and planning stage of this project, so we have not set a timeline for construction yet,\" Assanis said. \"However, this demonstration of state support for the project will greatly help us in our efforts to continue to raise the necessary funds through philanthropy.\"\nOfficials have not disclosed where the building will be located or any details about it, other than it will be on the main Newark campus and will house the Joseph R. Biden, Jr. School of Public Policy & Administration and the Biden Institute.\nThe Biden Institute was created after Biden left the vice presidency in 2017, and it is currently located in the old Blue and Gold Club on Kent Way. Chaired by the former president's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, the Biden Institute hosts events, brings prominent speakers to campus and focuses on developing domestic public policy.\nUD's highly ranked School of Public Policy & Administration, which was renamed for Biden in 2018, offers undergraduate and graduate programs in leadership, public administration, public policy, public health, disaster management and related fields. It is currently headquartered in Graham Hall on Academy Street.\nBiden Hall \"will harness the latest technology to cultivate academic growth, interdisciplinary research collaborations, dialogue, and civil discourse, all of which are crucial to a flourishing democracy in the 21st century,\" a UD spokesman said earlier this year.\nUD is also asking the state for $20 million to address deferred maintenance of its laboratories and other buildings. Former Gov. John Carney recommended that amount in the budget he submitted days before leaving office, but Meyer reduced it to $14 million in his recommended budget.\nAssanis asked the bond bill committee to provide the full $20 million.\n\"We're hoping that you will consider providing that level of funding to help us maintain academic spaces, especially the laboratories that provide our students with hands-on learning in biology, chemistry, physics, engineering and other disciplines,\" he said. \"Maintaining modern facilities is a critical component in preserving our stature as a top-tier research institution, which is one of the most significant ways that UD serves the needs of our state.\"\nUD has struggled in recent years to keep up with maintenance, accumulating a backlog of $1.2 billion in needed repairs and upgrades.\nThe university is trying to reduce that backlog by consolidating space across campus, closing underused buildings and considering situations where it makes sense to construct a new building rather than continue to repair an old one. Still, Assanis said, state funding needs to be part of the equation.\n\"It is extremely difficult to find philanthropists who want to support replacement of HVAC systems or torn seats in a lecture hall,\" he said. \"State capital assistance is one element of our plan, and we're grateful for every dollar that you provide.\"\nThe remainder of UD's capital request is $3.5 million to renovate lab and classroom space in Georgetown and Lewes, which would boost the university's Associates in Arts Program in southern Delaware. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chapel District Elementary renovations nearing 30% completion mark\n\n April 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 366\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CORDOVA — As students approach spring break and the final stretch of the school year, construction teams at Chapel District Elementary School are making progress.Kevin Shafer, director of operations for Talbot County Public Schools, told district and county officials this week that the first phase of work should be complete at the Cordova school this June.\nAbout $11.28 million, or around 30% of the total cost, has been spent to date, Shafer said. Construction progress isn't quite at that mark, however.\n\"We'll be about 30% done at the end of the first phase in June,\" Shafer said during a meeting Monday. \"And the reason for that is a lot of front loading.\"\nThe renovation is a multimillion-dollar effort that includes around $27 million in county funding as well as state funds from Maryland's Interagency Commission on School Construction. Construction is being led by the Whiting-Turner Contracting Company.\nThe project is set to fully renovate the existing building and add around 16,000 square feet. There will be additional learning space for the school, as well as a Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers site located in the building.\nThe school's media center is moving to the center of the building, and the playground is also under renovation.\nConstruction, which began in summer 2024, is expected to take a couple years. The school was built in 1952 and last renovated in 1994.\nShafer noted the construction project started about 34 days late due to unforeseen septic system issues and permitting delays.\nHe credited Bill Stagg, the project manager appointed by the Talbot County Council, for preventing what could've been a significant delay.\n\"He was instrumental in making sure that this project even got started on time,\" Shafer said. \"If that would've hit about 40 days, it would've been pushed back a year.\"\nSchool operations have continued in the existing building this year during the first phase of work. Phase two of renovations will begin this summer once school ends, Shafer said.\n\"That is why you will see a front loading of expenses, making sure the supplies and equipment are here in place ready to hit the ground running,\" he said.\n\"That is a make-or-break time for this project. We have to be ready by the time kids come back in August.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Four months in, Easton Middle staff, parents weigh in on cell phone pouches\n\n April 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Since December, Easton Middle School students have been placing their cell phones in locked pouches, a policy that's largely succeeding according to staff, though it hasn't quelled all parents' concerns.School principal Kelly Murdoch says students are no longer multi-tasking during teacher instruction by trying to talk to their friends on social media or texting apps. Overall, it has improved student engagement and restorative conflict management, she says.\n\"We've been intentional in trying to build those skills of having face-to-face interactions, because it's a skill that has been missing,\" Murdoch said.\nTalbot County followed suit of Caroline and Dorchester school districts, both of which began cell phone pouch pilot programs closer to the beginning of the school year. The districts acquired the pouches from the company Yondr.\nStudents place their phones in locked pouches at the start of the day, carry those pouches with them and unlock the pouches on a Yondr magnetic device when leaving.\n\"Initially, I was a little hesitant because of the safety issue that if something happened at school, I wanted to be able to get a hold of my child,\" said Carla Beavers, an EMS parent.\nBut Beavers said she was \"alleviated\" upon hearing from the district that emergency services professionals recommend students not use their phones during most emergencies. EMS also has \"portable\" unlocking devices, which Murdoch says allow students to unlock their phones if administrators deem it necessary during an emergency.\nPARENTS CHIME IN\nBeavers' son, a seventh grader, has left his phone at home since the new pouches were instituted. She says he's more focused on school instruction, and she hopes the pouch policy stays in place.\nHer son using the school phone to call her was \"seamless.\"\n\"He went to the office, he was allowed to make a phone call,\" Beavers said. \"I feel like the administrative team has it down.\"\nNicole Crosby, parent of an EMS eighth grader, has her son leave his phone at home too. He immediately brought his grades up, she said. But the decision to leave the phone at home stemmed from the pouches being \"ineffective,\" Crosby says.\n\"Having the knowledge that I do on what goes on in the eighth grade (and) what goes on in the middle school,\" Crosby said, \"I do not anticipate (the pouches) being very successful for the main reason of — we all had bets on how long it was going to take for the kids to break them and unlock them.\"\nMurdoch says Yondr has noted there are magnets out there that can be used to unlock their pouches, but the company warns it comes with the risk of damaging or breaking the phone. Murdoch said she hasn't seen students bring their own magnets yet.\nCrosby contends the policy would have better results with community investment. She says teachers are doing everything they can, but the ultimate responsibility falls on parents.\n\"They can't parent our children for us all the time,\" Crosby said. \"And if they don't have that support from us, then everything's going to be ineffective, unfortunately.\"\nMORE POUCHES TO COME?\nTCPS is leaving the door open to expanding the policy to other schools in the district, though not until next school year at the earliest. Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said opinions from members of her student advisory board are \"mixed.\"\n\"I have some students that feel like in high school, let's relinquish some of that independence and they should be able to have their phones,\" Pepukayi said.\nGabriella Streaker, a senior at Easton High and Board of Education student representative, believes the pouches could be useful at the high school level, particularly for ninth and tenth graders — though it wouldn't be a popular rule.\n\"Students can't really go anywhere without them. The phone is always with them,\" she said. \"And I often think the phone could be causing more issues than not.\"\nWhile others schools may or may not see the phone policy in coming years, the pouches have brought consistency and simplicity to Easton Middle's phone policy.\nTeachers, as well as administrators, are spending less time out of their days policing cell phones.\n\"It frees them up to do what they're supposed to do, which is be instructional leaders,\" Murdoch said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Schools face shortage of social workers\n\n April 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ELA JALIL Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 863\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Jaden Smith, a second-year master's student in social work at Howard University, is doing something not enough people do. He's working in a public high school, offering what he calls \"big brother love\" to his students.Smith, who started work at Bard High School Early College DC in Southeast Washington last fall while completing his degree, said he's now doing the same \"noble\" work that his mother did: serving as a school social worker.\nAnd thanks to a Howard program that aims to place social work students in schools in hopes that they'll work there full-time when they graduate, others are doing similar work. In the program's first two years, 22 second-year master's students have been placed in schools in the nation's capital to increase and diversify the school social work labor force, especially where they are needed the most.\nIt's called Project PRESS, which stands for Preparing Responsive and Effective School Social Workers. And the pilot program addresses a pressing need: a shortage of social workers in schools both in D.C. and nationwide.\nWhen Project PRESS started in 2023, there were 95 school social worker vacancies in D.C. public schools, said Sandra Jeter, an assistant professor of social work at Howard, at a panel about the project in December. And according to the School Social Work Association of America, no state in the union meets the recommended benchmark of one social worker for every 250 students.\nJeter, who launched Project PRESS with a five-year, $2.6 million federal grant, said social work programs at other universities could establish similar efforts to address the nationwide shortage of school social workers.\n\"I think PRESS can definitely be a model or just be an organization that offers this training to different universities that are developing social workers, whether they have a school social work focus or not,\" Jeter said. \"I think any university can adopt this model or work with me on expanding the model.\"\nIntensive training\nProject PRESS aims to motivate social work students to do something many of their predecessors have decided not to do: work in schools.\n\"The Project PRESS program is a really exciting thing to see to get students excited about the school social work profession,\" said Allie Perez, a representative of the School Social Work Association of D.C.\nThis yearlong program puts Howard social work students through two weeks of intensive training before they are placed at one of 11 participating schools. Students in the program receive a $10,000 stipend to ease some of the financial stresses of placement in a city school.\nSocial workers have different responsibilities than counselors and school psychologists. School social workers tend to work with specific students for long periods of time and create treatment or action plans.\n\"We do the mental health support, but we also take a more systemic view and we really focus on connecting people to resources and helping them remove barriers to those resources,\" Perez said.\nSchool counselors are more likely to focus on academic and career development compared to school social workers that are helping students with socio-emotional challenges.\nA school psychologist has the ability to diagnose students and perform psychosocial assessments, Jeter said.\nThe services that a school social worker provides, especially to underserved students, have a trickle-down effect on how a student performs, said Gloria Cain, an assistant professor at Howard's School of Social Work and a faculty member with Project PRESS.\n\"Social work is a discipline that really focuses on individuals within the context of their environment,\" Cain said.\nThe need\nProject PRESS focuses on sending students to D.C.'s Wards 7 and 8, historically Black and low-income areas located south of the Anacostia River.\nJeter said she believes these areas not only lack investment from the city but lack support rooted in the Black perspective that focuses on issues and trauma people often experience in majority Black and low-income communities.\nThe program focuses on culturally responsive training, which prepares program participants to engage with different student populations. It also teaches trauma-informed training, which promotes awareness of the systemic and individual trauma students carry with them so the student is not retraumatized.\nRacist incidents, poverty, food insecurity and homelessness are just some of the traumas students can carry with them that impact their performance in school. A main goal of the program is to interrupt these factors and use education as a gateway to success, Cain said.\nKyaus Washington, a 2024 graduate of Howard's master's of social work program, said it's important for social workers to know when students have experienced such traumas.\n\"Traumatic events happen to people and whenever you kind of understand that and try to understand from the person's perspective, then you're able to kind of tailor your modality to be effective based on the traumatic experience,\" Washington said.\nWashington works as a school-based expansion clinician at Lorraine H. Whitlock Elementary School in Ward 7. He noted negative experiences with therapists and the nation's long history of medical racism can lead to a sense of relief when a young Black student sees a Black social worker.\n\"People automatically have this shared sense of community with each other,\" Washington said. \"If they see, you know, me, a Black man walking into the school, my Black male students could automatically connect with me from that one shared identity.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Speakers ask to keep St. Mary's elementary music and arts intact\n\n April 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 705\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It was somewhat ironic that during Music and Art in our Schools Month that the heated and at times emotional topic of discussion during the March 26 St. Mary's school board meeting included discussion on scaling back such programs.On March 7, special area teachers were told about a three-year plan to transition from the current 10-day rotation cycle (A-Week, B-Week) to a four-day cohort model for elementary music and art.\nThe presentation noted that the inclusion of band, chorus and orchestra in the schedule offers third-, fourth- and fifth-graders a \"unique opportunity to be exposed to options provided in music education while minimizing disruptions to their academic learning.\" Currently, students participating in these ensembles are required to be pulled from core instruction two to four times per week.\nThe proposed change aims to \"enhance the quality of instruction, which is frequently interrupted by students moving in and out of the classroom for band, orchestra and chorus practices,\" according to the proposal.\nThe new model would allow students to engage in just one ensemble during their designated special area music time, replacing general music classes with participation in band, orchestra or chorus.\n\"Even if the budget was fully funded we would want to be talking about how we're delivering this in schools because we have inequity,\" Superintendent Scott Smith said. \"We need to have a different model than just kind of a random pullout for things. We need more structure.\"\nThirty minutes before the meeting started, the room was about 75% full and 36 speakers — ranging from educators, retired teachers, parents and students — voiced their concerns during the nearly 3½ hour meeting.\n\"A significant concern of this proposed schedule is the lack of access it would cause for some of our our most vulnerable learners,\" Mechanicsville Elementary School media specialist Michelle Smith said.\n\"So what does a cohort student look like coming into the secondary realm?\" asked Megan Czechanski-Giannuzzi, who has been the band director at Leonardtown Middle School for the past 18 years. \"They're unprepared, they can't handle middle school, they can't understand the content that we instruct and they're struggling with transition and they just have meltdowns. I suggest we not become Montgomery County, firing one out of every three secondary art and music educators. We don't need to be like Calvert County. We don't need to be like Charles County. We need to be St. Mary's County and do our best every day.\"\nOne Town Creek Elementary School student, who plays the saxophone, said that with the new schedule, \"I would struggle to be focused on the amount of content [teachers] want me to learn in one sitting,\" and added that she hoped the board would \"listen to the teachers and sit with them to find a solution.\"\n\"My plea to the board is that we consider ways of providing our current music education offerings and opportunities with the same frequency because it allows students to expand their brains in fun and engaging ways,\" paraeducator Deborah Hines of Evergreen Elementary said. \"Music education not only creates a well-rounded curriculum, but also encourages students to participate and attend school regularly.\"\nGeorge Winslow, who taught in the county for 44 years, said, \"How can you possibly not keep it going? I have no idea, and I'm glad I'm not in your seats right now because the arts are important.\"\nThe presentation was first delivered to specials teachers last month and Smith said it was being presented publicly because, \"We figured it was only fair to present the presentation that was made and where we are in the process as we move forward.\"\nThe presenting panel said they have been meeting weekly and collecting feedback about the proposed change. The plan calls for all schools to adopt the model over the next three school years.\nGreen Holly Elementary has been using the cohort model the last 10 years and Park Hall is piloting the cohort model this year.\nStaff noted that data from Park Hall stated, \"The number of pullouts and transitions dropped in 25 band classes per week, 13 strings classes per week, and two chorus classes per week to zero pullouts,\" and added, \"reducing the number of transitions for students has helped reduce referrals, suspensions and ISI, helping to keep students in the learning environment.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County Board of Ed declares last day of school, discuss virtual instruction\n\n April 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Caroline County Board of Education declared Tuesday, June 17, as the last day of the extended school year after inclement weather closures exceeded the four days allotted.The last day will be a half day for students and a full day for teachers.\nNext year, county schools will have three allotted inclement weather days. At the April 1 Board of Education meeting, district officials explored options for implementing virtual instruction should weather cause unexpected closures.\nBecause of the challenges presented by district officials, the board concluded it thinks the district will not be able to conduct virtual instruction on inclement weather days.\n\"The structure we tried to take with the presentation was a condensed version of some the requirements that the school system would have to meet if the county were to entertain virtual weather days,\" Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"We walked through some real tough spots for us to get to those points.\"\nInternet Connection and Google Meets\nThere are multiple factors Caroline County board of education most consider to conduct virtual inclement weather days. Including ensuring every student has a hotspot or wifi to participate in virtual learning.\nRobert Wielgosz, supervisor of technology, led the discussion on cellular service, offering points on the Kajeet program.\nKajeet was a hotspot used during the pandemic for students to connect to the internet in areas where wifi access was limited and not available.\nAccording to Wielgosz, when given the opportunity to use Kajeet, some students would use the hotspot for personal uses like video games and movies. This overloaded the hotspots and caused delays.\nThe estimate cost for Caroline County to provide the 700 needed Kajeet devices over five years would be about $736,000 for students and $35,000 for teachers.\nWielgosz also mentioned the need for Google Meet Breakout Rooms, which teachers use to conduct learning activities with groups in virtual classrooms. While this feature was available at no cost, it is no longer available in Caroline County's free Google plan.\n\"To get the feature back, it's going to cost Caroline County somewhere between $30,000 to $50,000 a year to get the premium Google aspect,\" Wielgosz said.\nMultilingual Learners, Special Education and Homelessness\nState law mandates districts \"ensure that all staff and students, including students with disabilities, homeless students, and English language learners, have the necessary devices at home for virtual education days, including access to Wifi.\"\nProviding equitable access to these services can be challenging during virtual instruction, district officials said.\nCaroline County has 576 multilingual learners, 569 individualized education program students and 116 students who experience homelessness. For these students, hands-on teacher engagement and preparation is required for proper learning.\n\"It's very hard to keep students engaged, especially for four hours of synchronous instruction,\" Erica McDonald, supervisor of special education, said. \"Without that in-person tangible motivating things that can keep them engaged during instruction, it can lead to increased frustration.\"\nProviding necessary technologies and translation services are also complicated by virtual instruction, the officials said.\nTeacher, staff negotiations\nSome district employees work on inclement weather days, and some staff members do not work and still get paid, district officials said.\nRequirements of the state say, \"during virtual inclement weather days the local school system shall offer public school employees who are not assigned to work during the virtual education day an opportunity to make up the lost work through other duties before the beginning of the next school year.\"\nThe district would be responsible for determining how this work would be made up.\nVirtual learning days require additional planning from teachers, which requires a negotiation with the teachers' union for proper pay.\n\"Our teachers work really hard. We all know are teachers work outside of hours. We have all come to accept that it comes with the job,\" Dr. Robert Willoughby, director of administrative services said. \"However, the law does say that we may negotiate with our teachers' union. They have a right to come to negotiate if there is extra work here we would like extra compensation for that.\"\nAfter going through the presentation, Simmons concluded it would be to hard for the county to pull off virtual inclement weather days.\n\"I don't see how as a county, with the resources we have right now, that this puts us in a great position to be able to hit all the marks to be able to pull this off effectively to meet all requirements,\" Simmons said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Rescinded federal reimbursements cause $1.4 million impact on TCPS health center\n\n April 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 525\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Construction work on a health center for Talbot County Public Schools staff members has been delayed due to rescinded reimbursements from the U.S. Department of Education.School board and district leaders have touted the Marathon Health center — located on Idlewild Avenue and expected to open later this year — as a significant benefit for staff and their families. But now the project is facing an uncertain future following a notice from the U.S. Department of Education.\nIn a March 28 letter, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon announced effective the same day that the department would not be honoring extension requests for projects that were granted pandemic-era funds, such as the American Rescue Plan's Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief, or ESSER, program.\nThe move left the state with millions of dollars in funding at risk after it was previously granted an extension by the Biden administration.\nState Superintendent Carey Wright said in a press release that the rescinded reimbursements would put more than $400 million of Maryland schools' pandemic-era funding in jeopardy.\nAbout $305 million had already been spent and was awaiting reimbursement from the federal government, state officials said in March. About $112 million had not yet been paid out by the state, requiring school districts to halt ongoing work.\nAt a Board of Education meeting Wednesday, TCPS Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said the district isn't finding itself in a huge hole with regards to the reimbursement window unexpectedly closing.\nBut as far as the staff health center goes, the district is \"sort of dead in the water,\" she said.\nTCPS has paid $127,000 to Marathon for its work to date, Jones said. Remaining costs total to around $1.4 million.\n\"Those are costs that have not yet been spent, but we don't have authority to spend them,\" Jones said.\nJones told board members the district contacted Marathon, and the company quit work on the project.\nThe board agreed to revisit the question of funding the health center at a future meeting. Jones said there are multiple funding options at the district's disposal, including tapping into fund balance.\n\"We should really figure out how to make this work, and we should fund this,\" Board President Emily Jackson said.\nBoth Caroline County Public Schools and Dorchester County Public Schools have been fully reimbursed for all of their ESSER-related spending, according to school officials.\n\"We expended our funding within the timeline that was originally stated,\" CCPS Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"We considered (extending), but we did not end up needing it.\"\nSimmons and Dorchester County assistant superintendent Jodi Colman each said the March 28 letter did raise concerns for the status of federal funding in general.\nIn the letter, McMahon wrote the department \"will consider an extension to your liquidation period on an individual project-specific basis.\"\nWednesday, TCPS Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi noted the state has submitted an extension request to the U.S. Department of Education.\nJones said she imagines there will have to be \"some allowances for costs that have actually been incurred\" made by the federal government.\n\"There are literally schools that are in the middle of some sort of construction, capital improvement, and you can't leave a gym half built,\" Jones said. \"You can't leave an HVAC system half-installed.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He has been a teacher in Caroline County since 2009.\n\"It's an absolutely amazing feeling,\" Buffenmyer said of winning. \"It's an amazing county and the greatest group of students in the entire world.

I wasn't expecting it being a fairly new employee of the county,\" Marshall said about winning the award.\n\"I couldn't ask for a better group of people to work with. They make it enjoyable to come to work. I've came from other job, jobs that just wear you down, and it's a good experience to be here. The kids, seeing them every day and how they enjoy it, it's just a pleasure.\"\nWhile Marshall appreciates the award, he said regardless of winning, he plans to put his all in for the students at Greensboro Elementary.\n\"I appreciate it,\" Marshall said. \"I've told my supervisors that no matter what, this doesn't change who I am.

Students place their phones in locked pouches at the start of the day, carry those pouches with them and unlock the pouches with a magnetic device when leaving.\nAdministrators have sung the praises of the new phone rules, citing an improvement in student engagement and a decrease in bullying.\n\"I can't imagine discontinuing it,\" Board Vice President Amy Dodson said Wednesday.\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi estimated it will cost the district around $9,000 to purchase pouches for St. Michaels Middle and replacements for some worn pouches at Easton Middle.\nHIGH SCHOOL DEBATE\nBoard members voiced differing opinions on whether to introduce pouches at the high school level.\nPresident Emily Jackson said she wants to see more data on the effectiveness of the pouches, suggesting the district monitor this year's sixth graders through the next two years for behavioral and academic trends.\nBoard member Ann O'Connor argued pouches should be instituted in the high schools.\n\"We all know the effects of the cell phone and how it adversely affects our students, so why wouldn't we?\" O'Connor said.\n\"This is a trial program,\" Jackson said. \"I just want to see more before I feel comfortable saying yes definitely.\"\nBoard member Karla Wieland-Cherry pushed back on putting the pouches in the high school next year, stating schools need to work on managing students' behaviors.\n\"By the time this sixth grade class reaches the high school, it will already be an expected behavior,\" Wieland-Cherry said.\nChief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said purchasing pouches for high school students could cost around $38,000.\nO'Connor said she doesn't think the money to bring the program to the high schools is an issue. She emphasized the impacts that phone use and constant notifications have on the younger generation.\n\"Isn't our job to educate and take away all these distractions?\" O'Connor said. \"It is a distraction, we know this. There are studies, there is data.\"\nWieland-Cherry responded, saying it's hard to stop an addiction like cell phone usage cold turkey. \"They do need time to adjust,\" she said.\nJackson said she's open to considering an expansion into high school in the future, but not for next year. She said there's added nuance to the situations high schoolers face, such as those who are parents, care for younger siblings or work jobs.\n\"I look at high schoolers and think there's a major difference between a freshman and a senior,\" Jackson said.\nDuring discussion, O'Connor motioned for the pouch program to be extended to high schools in the district. Board member Deborah Bridges joined her in voting yes, but the remaining five members voted the measure down. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "College built as an economic engine for Shore\n\n April 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CLIFFORD P. COPPERSMITH | Section: Columns \n \n 823\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Nearly 60 years after its inception, Chesapeake College remains at the center of regional progress and innovation. The college's role and mission were highlighted earlier this month when Maryland's top leaders gathered in our Health Professions and Athletics Center.Gov. Wes Moore held his cabinet meeting on our Wye Mills campus, part of an initiative to travel to every corner of the state. After that meeting, Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller and Secretary of the Maryland Higher Education Commission Sanjay Rai toured Chesapeake's skilled trades labs and new mobile welding trailer, to learn about the college's response to local economic and workforce needs and to meet some of our students.\nIn bringing his cabinet to our campus, Gov. Moore reinforced the college's role as a regional hub, fueling progress for the Shore. We discussed our shared priorities, like connecting Marylanders to jobs, ensuring student success and creating an equitable and robust economy.\nOpen-access institutions and workforce champions like Chesapeake are helping to give Marylanders a hand up to better lives — and that has always been what we're about. Conceived during the Truman Commission, the concept of the community college is part of the American Dream. As individuals set their own goals and choose their own paths to success, community colleges provide the guidance and knowledge for achieving success.\nDuring a time of rapid change in the 1960s, Eastern Shore leaders joined together to found the college, creating a lasting resource available to all residents of our region. With foresight and a commitment to working together, the founders of Chesapeake created an institution designed to respond to the full spectrum of human interest and ability and to offer something to everyone, from transfer-bound college students to industry professional seeking new certifications to retirees enriching their lives.\nThough milestones such as the Wye Mills groundbreaking and opening of the first buildings on campus in 1967 and the first commencement in 1969 would follow, the charter date of December 1965 marks the official beginning of Chesapeake College.\nRemarkably, Chesapeake is still the only community college in Maryland with five support counties — a geographical area comprising nearly one fifth of the state's landmass. We're grateful for the support we enjoy from our diverse and beautiful counties, our many and varied business partners and the whole of our service community. That support has enabled this institution to endure for 60 years, in turn supporting Eastern Shore residents in finding meaningful education and employment in a wide variety of political, economic and social changes.\nEven now that community-building and economy-building role continues at Chesapeake, through partnerships with county leaders, local school systems, generous donors, friends and more. In the past five years, I am proud to say that our faculty and staff have supported students to higher graduation and transfer rates; we recently ranked second in the state among community colleges, based on a study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia.\nLooking forward, we have ambitious plans to develop cutting-edge workforce training facilities, to demonstrate that trades jobs are the \"new tech\" jobs and help keep Eastern Shore talent right here at home on this beautiful peninsula — not just the \"land of pleasant living\" but a landscape where we see abundant personal and professional opportunities.\nEveryone here at Chesapeake is proud to serve our students and region, believing we are one of the most important resources to residents of the Mid-Shore and watching generations of our graduates serving their communities and giving back every day.\nAcquiring skills and achieving academic success are key components of a college experience, but personal growth can contribute just as much to a student's life.\nOur students develop critical thinking skills and learn how to make intellectual and interpersonal connections. Students get to know and collaborate with classmates of different ages, backgrounds and experiences. They consider the biggest challenges facing society today, and they learn to find common ground and work toward a greater good.\nThese experiences can't be assessed with test scores, grades or certifications. They are, however, critical for people who are able to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing world.\nI can't predict what the next 60 years will bring for higher education. The world will change in ways that we can only imagine now. Chesapeake College, as always, will adapt to those changes and continue to prepare our students for what's next in their lives as we contribute to the vitality of our community.\nI hope you will help us celebrate the 60th birthday of Chesapeake College. We're planning a variety of events on campus to mark this special occasion, and you can learn more about our plans at chesapeake.edu. First up is the dedication of our new mobile welding lab on April 24 at 1:30 pm on our Wye Mills campus. If you can't visit us then, look for our mobile lab in the service area as we take our skilled trades training into the community, striving as always to meet our students wherever they are. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The school's budget is $1.31 million higher than its fiscal year 2025 budget.\nPart of the $9.02 million budget request included a $952,560 request for the design of a new technical building. Chesapeake College Vice President for Administrative Services Karen Smith said the new building will have areas for a variety of programs, including agriculture, electrical, welding and fabrication, construction trades and advanced manufacturing. She said the cost for the design phase could be lower depending on state approval.\nAlthough the five counties approved the request for funding for the design, the decision came with a shift in contributions toward the project.\nDorchester County's share of costs for the design phase will be taken on by Queen Anne's County. This means Queen Anne's County's responsibility for the project will jump from 28.9%, or an estimated $275,290, to 47.8%, or an estimated $455,324.\nDuring the meeting, Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer and Vice President Mike Detmer outlined their council's concerns regarding paying for the project.\nAlthough other counties hope to use the new technical building for career and technical education at the high school level, Dorchester County has a career and technology center it is still paying off, they said.\nThrough its budget process, Dorchester County has struggled to eliminate an estimated $6.2 million deficit.\nPfeffer said Dorchester County takes in about $45 million in property and income taxes and will have to give Dorchester County Public Schools $26.6 million for fiscal year 2026.\n\"So we're trying to run the rest of the county on half of that,\" he said. \"So while in conceptual context, we believe in the project, fiscally our citizens and our staff are saying we don't know how we're going to be able to participate.\"\nAt the Chesapeake College meeting, Queen Anne's County Commissioner Jack Wilson Jr. shared his county's decision to cover Dorchester County for the project design costs.\n\"We all know what happens if we let this money go back to the state,\" Wilson said. \"It's going to go somewhere else in this state, and it's not going to be here. We got this far. And Lenny, listen, I feel for you guys. I know what you're going through. But I think we just need to keep it on the rails at least through the design phase and see what the state's going to help with.\"\nAccording to documents from the meeting, the state will support 75% of project costs, and the counties will support the remaining 25%.\nAfter the counties voted to approve the amended capital budget, Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian said he understands the position Dorchester County is in, mentioning the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and \"unfunded mandates\" by the state.\n\"I think we all understand any one of us could be in your same position very easily,\" Fithian told the Dorchester County Council members. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some of these girls are not imagining futures for themselves that are actually in reality open to them.\"\nBAAM, located on Jowite Street in Easton, is a nonprofit that aims to provide educational and social spaces for at-risk and minority youth. Executive Director Dina Daly said Ryan's gift will allow the organization to expand its program out to girls at the middle-school level.\nDaly called Ryan's said BAAM will be putting some of the money toward the girls program and investing the rest.\n\"We will make these funds last us beyond just today, and tomorrow and the next day,\" Daly said. \"We could actually spend it all, but then it wouldn't leave a legacy.\"\nThe $1 million contribution is the largest one-time gift to BAAM's programming, Daly said, and is one of the largest overall monetary donations made in recent history.\nDaly pitched the idea to Ryan this winter and was excited when Ryan jumped on board. Ryan said the theme of mentorship was a driving force behind her decision to donate.\nRyan, 75, is a transgender woman. She said the mentors and women who assisted her during her gender transition inspired her to fund a program in which women will be mentoring young girls.\n\"That's very powerful to me because I've experienced it firsthand,\" Ryan said. She added that Daly's leadership and success with the nonprofit make her confident the money will be put to good use.\n\"Dina is a force of nature,\" Ryan said. \"She's an amazing human being. She's very quiet in most circumstances. But she's an incredible, active listener. When you talk with her, it's like you're the only person in the world to her right at that moment.

    "content": "‘Catastrophic’: Could Trump 'defund\" Head Start preschools program?\n\n April 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: National \n \n 889\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Jennie Mauer is concerned about a looming \"chaotic disaster.\"Mauer is executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association.\nHead Start is a federal program offering free preschools to close to 800,000 lower-income kids nationwide and dates to the 1960s.\nMauer and other early education advocates are worried about current Head Start funding and the program's future with President Donald Trump's austerity efforts and a draft White House budget showing no funding for the $12.1 billion preschool effort.\nIn some rural and poorer communities, Head Start can be one of the only childcare options for lower income and working class families.\n\"There are many places where Head Start fills a critical void,\" said Mauer, whose group represents preschools across Wisconsin that receive funding under Head Start.\nEarlier this month, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said the Trump administration has slowed $943 million in existing Head Start funding that goes directly from the federal government to local providers across the country.\nMurray said in a statement the \"slow-walk' of money prompted one Head Start provider serving 400 kids in eastern Washington state to temporarily close earlier this month.\n\"Before our very eyes, Donald Trump is defunding Head Start,\" said U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin.\nShe said the Trump administration has delayed as much as $35 million in approved Head Start disbursements in Wisconsin so far this year.\nMauer said 40 Head Start providers in Wisconsin are budgeted $258 million annually to serve approximately 15,000 kids.\nShe said current DOGE efforts — including a short-lived spending freeze right after Trump took office in January and downsizing at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services — have providers jumping through more hoops to get payrolls approved and the families they serve are concerned about current and future funding.\n\"It's chaotic,\" she said.\nMauer and other Head Start backers say the program is the only thing keeping some areas of the country from becoming \"child care deserts\" with few (or sometimes no) affordable daycare options.\nKaren Filipovich, executive director of the Montana Head Start Association, said there is uncertainty about the War on Poverty-era program.\n\"I think right now there is a lot of wait and see,\" Filipovich said.\nHead Start funding in Montana totals $62 million annually. Filipovich said there are 22 programs, including on Native American reservations, serving more than 3,900 kids.\nShe said many areas of Montana, which has a population of just over 1.1 million people, are already childcare deserts with few affordable options.\nThe average cost of child care is $1,000 per month in Montana, Tennessee, Florida and other states and can run even more in other states, including Ohio ($1,400 per month), Maryland ($1,600 per month) and California ($1,800), according to the Economic Policy Institute.\nFilipovich doesn't think state governments have the financial bandwidth to take over funding.\n\"We are already struggling with the capacity to take care of kids,\" she said.\nHead Start advocates said the cuts or an elimination would have its economic toll, making it harder for working class parents and grandparents to afford child care and get jobs.\nFilipovich said those families are also concerned about other Trump cuts and potential changes for Medicaid, Social Security and other safety net programs.\nTrump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) austerity programs and congressional Republican efforts have frequently mirrored Project 2025.\nThe policy blueprint calls for Head Start to be eliminated, saying the program \"is fraught with scandal and abuse\" and citing a 2020 federal Inspector General's report that said as many as 'one in four' Head Start providers had problems with child supervision and others were not promptly reporting abuse or mistreatment allegations.\n\"Between October 2015 and May 2020, 12 % of recipients received an adverse finding for child abuse,\" the 2020 federal inquiry found.\nIn March, the Trump administration announced it was looking to cut 20,000 jobs at HHS to bring the agency headcount down to 62,000 employees.\nThe austerity efforts have resulted in the closure of six of HHS's 10 regional offices, including in Chicago, New York and Seattle.\nThe agency — which has said its restructurings will improve efficiencies and use of tax dollars — has not yet responded to a request for comment on Head Start funding.\nWanda Minick, executive director of the Florida Head Start Association, said the government-funded preschool program also offers hearing and vision screenings as well as meal and nutrition programs for low-income kids.\n\"At a time when we need solutions to workforce shortages, early education access, and economic disparities, cutting Head Start would be a step backward,\" Minick said.\nFilipovich said Head Start staff are also worried about the future of the program and their jobs.\nHead Start preschool programs, which serve infants and toddlers up to age 5, employ more than 250,000 staff across the country, according to the National Head Start Association (NHSA).\nThat includes 1,300 workers in Montana and close to 11,600 in Florida.\nNHSA has called a federal defunding of Head Start \"catastrophic\" for working class and low-income families.\nLast year, the Biden administration issued a new rule raising Head Start teacher pay — which ranged on average between $35,000 and $40,000 nationally — by approximately $10,000.\nRepublicans pushed back on the pay increases, with U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, saying \"the effort smells like an attempt to form Head Start educators into a unionized political block.\"\nThe Trump administration — which has reversed a number of policies from the previous White House — has not yet taken any action on Biden's Head Start pay rule. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You are truly the heart of this initiative,\" she said.\nWhether finishing up a rookie year or going strong with several seasons under their belts, through the appreciation dinner each and every volunteer was lauded by name for their commitment to coaching and mentoring local children.\nFinishing out her first year of coaching and receiving a certificate of recognition was Kimberly Kight who, volunteering at Centreville Elementary School with kindergarteners, considered the experience immensely rewarding.\n\"I love it. The kids' eyes just light up when you enter the classroom,\" she said, her own eyes sparkling.\nVolunteers also included Fred Sheriff, who was recognized for his 14 years of coaching at Church Hill Elementary. Sheriff said he strives to make every session fun and engaging and matches his iconic bowtie with the corresponding pillar colors every month.\nEvery classroom session brings forth a sense of accomplishment for a brighter tomorrow, \"And you know you're helping,\" he said.\nMore information about QAC Character Counts can be found at www.peopleofcharacter.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "PoliTalks transitions leadership as new era begins at Washington College\n\n May 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 822\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — The founders of PoliTalks, Washington College students Stephen Hook and Zach Affeldt, are stepping down from group leadership as they graduate next month.While both are preparing for promising careers, Hook assured the crowd at their spring lecture on April 24 at Hynson Lounge that the club's future is in good hands. The event, held on the second floor of Hodson Hall, featured renowned speaker Heather Mizeur, who delivered the lecture \"Disagreement is Democratic.\"\nThe lecture, free to the public, included an introduction to the new PoliTalks leadership: co-presidents Charlotte Schurman and Grace Walsh. \"We feel confident in our team to take the group forward,\" Schurman said during a catered meal and Q&A session following Mizeur's discussion.\nSchurman and Walsh are continuing the tradition of PoliTalks: to provide a safe, respectful forum for political education and conversation.\nHook reflected on the club's success during a politically charged climate, noting that he was pleased to see people with differing views engage in peaceful discussions about polarizing issues during the Trump administration.\nMizeur, a former Maryland state delegate, candidate for Congress, and CEO and founder of WeAreOne Alliance, led these discussions. This was her second time giving the lecture. She discussed the guiding principles she learned while reaching across the aisle and campaigning.\nJust as she did at the Toll Science Center on Oct. 17, 2024, Mizeur introduced her mnemonic device: **RESPECTFUL**, which stands for Reciprocity, Engagement, Sovereignty, Pause, Equanimity, Curiosity, Trust, Freedom, Unhook, and Listen.\nIn this session, she focused on the \"S\" — **Sovereignty**.\nMizeur defined sovereignty as \"the ability to stand in your own agency.\" She explained that how we respond to political disagreements, while maintaining self-control and understanding, is key to sovereignty.\nMizeur stated that the nation's collective sovereignty is currently under assault. She criticized the Trump administration for trampling due process and weaponizing fear and control, leading to the dehumanization of people.\n\"The initial response to these policies,\" Mizeur said, \"is to react with fear and frustration, instead of responding with sovereignty, which is a conscious choice rooted in integrity.\"\nSovereignty, Mizeur explained, is a calming force that leads us to a different path, one that cannot be legislated or controlled.\n\"It's not earned, but inherited,\" Mizeur said.\nShe offered lessons on how to reconnect with one's own inherited sovereignty.\nMizeur emphasized that sovereignty does not mean being a doormat. It requires setting boundaries, practicing a firm \"yes\" and \"no,\" and avoiding separation from others, which leads to isolation and despair. She encouraged practices like journaling, speaking with a friend or partner, and engaging in joyful activities to help individuals maintain sovereignty.\nMizeur also emphasized the importance of listening to the body's warnings and stepping back from social media to detox and nourish oneself.\n\"Sovereignty is a practice, not a switch you turn on and off when needed,\" Mizeur added.\nShe said practicing these principles brings deeper joy, freedom, and can spark real change in hearts and lives.\nThe discussion continued over a catered dinner, where guests of all ages discussed how to apply these principles in their own lives. Some shared stories of losing friends or family members over political differences and blocking people on social media. Tensions over political debates had surfaced in families.\nOne attendee suggested that protests, such as the \"Hands Off Rally,\" should include what participants are fighting for, in addition to what they oppose, emphasizing the positive.\nA few attendees remarked that they no longer view people with opposing views as \"enemies.\" A central lesson from Mizeur's talk was to lead with curiosity and learn from everyone, regardless of their political affiliation.\nOthers acknowledged that life experiences can lead to differing viewpoints, and sometimes, religion plays a role in those differences.\nOne woman pointed out issues on which everyone could agree, such as the need for more jobs and affordable housing.\nHook, who founded PoliTalks after witnessing the need for peaceful discussions on campus following a Washington College lecture by conservative speaker Robert George, expressed his satisfaction with the club's success. George had cut his speech short on Sept. 7, 2023, due to protests.\n\"This is the best possible way we could have ended with the club,\" Hook said.\nHe thanked everyone involved, especially Mizeur, for her nonprofit work in coalition building through community partnerships. \"Heather brings a unique narrative to the conversation around political dialogue that we believe is important for our community to hear,\" Hook said.\nFor those who missed Mizeur's talks, they can sign up for her newsletter and receive information about her 2025 programming at [https://www.weareonealliance.org/](https://www.weareonealliance.org/).\nWhat's next for PoliTalks under new leadership?Schurman noted that environmental justice is a strong focus across campus. She plans to invite Serena C. McIlwain, Maryland secretary of the environment, for a future lecture.\nAs they call for more student involvement, PoliTalks plans to hold monthly meetings.\nSeveral members of the Chestertown government attended the event, including Mayor David Foster and Council Member Sheila Austrian of Ward 1. Austrian found the discussion eye-opening and thanked the college and PoliTalks for reaching out to the community in such a meaningful way. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Assanis to step down as University of Delaware president\n\n May 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1284\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n University of Delaware President Dennis Assanis will step down at the end of the school year, he said in a surprise announcement Monday.The decision comes as Assanis has one year left on his contract but has faced increasing criticism from faculty over his handling of the university's finances.\n\"At this point, I believe I have made the meaningful contributions that I set out to accomplish with all of you in translating our shared vision into a reality and advancing our institutional mission and strategic goals,\" Assanis wrote in a letter to the campus community. \"I therefore feel this is the appropriate moment to make a leadership transition, with the institution's best interests always in mind and a thoughtful approach for continued growth and excellence.\"\nAssanis will work through June 30, and then an interim president will take over while the board of trustees searches for a new permanent leader, a process that often takes upward of a year.\nBoard President Terri Kelly said the interim president will be announced later.\n\"I want to thank Dennis Assanis for his inspiring leadership and service as the University of Delaware's 28th president,\" Kelly said in a statement. \"His tireless commitment and bold vision have been transformative, advancing the university to new levels of accomplishment, promise and potential. As we look ahead to the next chapter in the university's leadership, President Assanis' legacy of purpose-driven, positive change will forever have an impact on UD's continued future of institutional excellence. We wish him and Eleni nothing but the best for their future.\"\nAssanis' resignation follows a string of high-profile departures in recent months. John Long, executive vice president and chief operating officer, is retiring this week, and Mary Remmler, senior vice president and chief financial officer, resigned last week. Athletic Director Chrissi Rawak left earlier this year.\nIt also comes at a fraught time for higher education institutions nationwide, which have seen funding cuts and other threats from the Trump administration.\nA record of campus growth\nAssanis came to UD in 2016, replacing former president Patrick Harker. Before coming to Delaware, the native of Greece was provost at Stony Brook University and had spent most of his academic career as an engineering professor and administrator at the University of Michigan.\nIn 2021, the UD Board of Trustees announced that it had extended Assanis' contract through 2026. With a total compensation of more than $1.5 million, he was the third-highest paid public university president in 2023, according to rankings by the Chronicle of Higher Education.\nAssanis' tenure at UD was marked by tremendous growth at the STAR Campus, including the construction of the STAR Tower, the Ammon Pinizzotto Biopharmaceutical Innovation Center, the Chemours Discovery Hub, the FinTech Innovation Hub and, coming soon, the Securing American Biomanufacturing Research and Education Center and a Buccini Pollin Group apartment complex. UD's role as headquarters for the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals has brought in hundreds of millions in federal funding.\nWhen Assanis arrived in 2016, the STAR Campus was still in its infancy. Now, the site is home to 1.2 million square feet of new buildings and employs 3,000 people, more than it did when Chrysler was there.\nOn the main campus, UD opened the South Academy Residence Hall and, most recently, the new interdisciplinary science lab known as Building X. Earlier this year, the university announced its largest-ever donation, a $71.5 million commitment from alumni Rob and Kathy Siegfried to construct a new building for the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics.\nAssanis also launched the First State Promise, a program that aims to cover all tuition and fees for Delawarean undergraduate students coming from families with incomes under $75,000. Approximately one-third of enrolled Delawareans are covered by the program.\nOn the athletics side, one of Assanis' first hires was Rawak as athletic director and together they aimed to increase the prominence of Blue Hen sports programs, which Assanis often said are the \"front porch\" of the university. He presided over the renovation of Delaware Stadium, the construction of the Whitney Athletic Center and most recently the decision to move to Conference USA and the Football Bowl Subdivision.\nFinancial strife\nAssanis led the university through COVID-19, a crisis that required the university to quickly pivot to virtual learning and upended the university's finances. At the height of the pandemic, UD reported a $250 million deficit and instituted employee layoffs and furloughs.\nAs the pandemic waned, the university's financial difficulties continued. In 2024, Assanis reported that UD had a budget deficit of up to $40 million, which he blamed on inflation and skyrocketing health insurance costs.\nAssanis instituted a partial hiring freeze, delayed capital projects, restricted employee travel and implemented other austerity measures. The university is forecasting another large deficit this year.\nIt was Assanis' handling of that situation that prompted criticism from faculty members.\nLast spring, a survey of more than 750 university professors found that virtually all believed the university was not transparent about its finances and that it did not prioritize academics when it came to budgeting, according to reporting by the Newark Post's newsroom partner, Spotlight Delaware. About a dozen professors submitted anonymous comments that said they wanted faculty to call for a vote of no confidence in Assanis.\nIn a study released earlier this year, the faculty union questioned Assanis' \"poverty narrative\" and argued that the university's continued building spree was to blame for the financial difficulties.\n\"That's a lot of operating resources to be directed into building,\" Persephone Braham, the president of the university's faculty union, told Spotlight Delaware. \"That's tuition, that's fees, that's research [facilities and administrative] funding, that is a local contribution from the endowment draw down, and only an average of 9-10% is being funded by presidential fundraising.\"\nTown-gown relations\nAssanis leaves a complicated legacy in terms of the university's relationship with the city it calls home.\nUnder his tenure, UD has faced sustained criticism from many Newark leaders and residents for its decision to push more of the burden of housing students onto the private sector, putting pressure on the city to approve more and more off-campus student housing projects, often against the wishes of residents.\nIn 2019, UD abruptly closed the Christina Towers, thus taking 1,300 beds off the market. The university also took control of the once-private University Courtyard Apartments, which removed the sprawling complex from the city tax rolls.\nUD has also faced criticism for not contributing enough to the city's finances. That came to a head last year when city council — against the strong opposition of the UD administrators and students — began lobbying the state legislature for the power to levy a per-student tax on UD. A bill allowing the city to do so passed the state House and is awaiting consideration in the Senate.\nFormer mayor Jerry Clifton credited Assanis with cultivating a better relationship with the city than previous UD administrations did.\n\"Dennis made sure that I had all his contact information and could readily reach out to him,\" Clifton said in an interview Monday. \"I've enjoyed our relationship together with Dennis and Eleni, and I certainly will miss that.\"\nHe also praised Assanis for agreeing to sell the former Rodney dorm complex to the city at a steep discount, leading to the creation of Hillside Park and the stormwater pond.\n\"It was a huge win for the city,\" Clifton said. \"There's no way that would be a park today if it wasn't for the university and Dennis cooperating at the level that they did.\"\nThat said, UD's public battle against the student tax hurt how the public views the university, Clifton said.\n\"I think there could have been, and had been some, negotiations, but what they saw as their value to the community was not necessarily the cash that we saw that we needed because of the loss in tax revenue,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, to Emma Agazzani, a resident of Italy's \"Capital of Culture,\" living in the U.S.A. in general and Calvert County in particular has hit a high note.According to her, it's been a dream come true.\n\"It was something I wanted to do since I was very young,\" the teen told Southern Maryland News, adding that \"the language, the culture, the travel\" had her determined to pursue the opportunity to experience the life of a foreign exchange student.\n\"I applied in February 2022 with A.S.S.E.,\" Agazzani, 17, said.\nThe American Scandinavian Student Exchange has expanded since it was established in 1976. The exchange has its origins in Europe in the late-1930s. After World War II the exchange gained momentum and today over 30 countries on six continents participate.\nOn its website, the exchange states its mission is an effort \"to foster international understanding through educational and cross cultural programs.\"\n\"My parents were hosts,\" Danielle Higginbotham of Huntingtown told Southern Maryland News in recalling how she and her family opened their home to Agazzani. \"I knew it was something we wanted to do. We were researching students and Emma's profile stuck out with us.\"\nAgazzani is a senior at Huntingtown High this year and will walk in the June graduation ceremony before returning to Italy later that month when her exchange program ends. She said since Italian high school is a five-year program she still has another year of secondary schooling to go in her home country before she will be off to a university.\nAt Huntingtown, Agazzani has been able to experience something that wouldn't be possible in Europe.\nOf cheerleading, Agazzani said, \"It was another of my dreams. When I think about the U.S. and high school, I think about cheerleading, because cheerleading is not a thing in Italy or Europe in general. It was my only option.\"\nIn addition to cheerleading, Agazzani has played lacrosse, a sport that hasn't caught on at all in Europe.\n\"I just finished lacrosse season and I really like it,\" she said, crediting her coaches for teaching her how to play the sport and excel in it.\nLife for Emma Agazzani of Mantua at Huntingtown High hasn't been all cheers and sports, though. As a student, she is taking classes in Advanced Placement English — she has been taught English since first grade — A.P. Government, pre-calculus, biology, photography and theater.\nAs for what she will study in college, Agazzani said, \"It's going to be something about science. I would like to be a neurologist.\"\nWhen not in school, the Higginbothams have given Agazzani a chance to see America. She has traveled to several locations in Florida, including Disney World, where she donned a cheerleader's outfit for the annual Christmas parade.\nWhile in Florida, Agazzani also got a chance to swim with dolphins.\n\"We tried to do a whole bunch of 'must-sees,'\" Higginbotham said.\nThe hosts and exchange student have also traveled to New York City, Atlanta and Philadelphia.\nAgazzani recalled one obligatory culinary experience in Philadelphia.\n\"I had the cheesesteak,\" she said. \"That was amazing.\"\nShe also has been to Washington, D.C., and visited the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll, meeting President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump.\nComparing the urbanized character of her hometown, with its art galleries and opera houses, to the bucolic, wide open expanse of Huntingtown, Agazzani said, \"it's very different. In Italy everything is tiny and compressed. Here, everything is spread out and very big.\"\nOf her hometown she said, \"We are walkable. We have a lot of history and arts.\"\nAgazzani summed up her Hurricane high school experience, saying, \"I really like the school and this town. I'm a senior here. I think it's more interesting.\"\nHigginbotham conceded that the experience of having a teenage cheerleader in her home has been so incredible that, while she will offer aid and advice to other families who want to participate in hosting an exchange student, for now she feels fulfillment from her experiences with Agazzani.\n\"She's my daughter now,\" Higginbotham said. \"We've created a friendship, a bond.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They also describe their own role within the organization along with the day-to-day functions,\" Carter said.\nIt is advantageous to students because employers know real-world demands and can outline the educational requirements to work in that field.\nParticipating businesses this year included Chesapeake CNC, DMS & Associates, Eastman Specialty Corp., Modern Stone Age Food Lab, Sunrise Solar, University of Maryland Shore Medical Center, Washington College GIP Program and the University of Maryland Extension, which partnered with Red Acres Hydroponics to demonstrate the wide range of advances in agricultural technologies.\nCarter said the Kent County STEM students, their parents and teachers greatly appreciate the businesses and professionals who share their time and resources to make the program a success.\n\"The program is a timely resource for students as they look into secondary education and any specialized studies they will need in order to qualify for the careers they desire,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot council mulling $1.1 million request from school district\n\n May 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 706\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — With less than two weeks until the Talbot County Council adopts its budget ordinance for next fiscal year, education funding hangs in the balance.Talbot County Public Schools is seeking $1.1 million in additional funds for fiscal year 2026 — $600,000 to fill nine new positions and $500,000 for teacher and staff salary increases. The former would add to the district's multilingual and special education staff, while the latter aims to inch the district closer to state-mandated $60,000 teacher salary minimums by fiscal year 2027.\nDistrict leaders say it's a \"scaled-back\" request from its $5.7 million ask of the county earlier this budget cycle.\n\"We recognize the financial pressures you face,\" Board of Education President Emily Jackson said at a May 6 budget hearing. \"This ask is lean, deliberate and rooted in what's most necessary to keep moving forward.\"\nIn the county's budget already is $55 million for TCPS as required by The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's overarching education improvement framework.\nCouncil members are left to mull the best option as they prepare to vote on final amendments to the county's draft $161 million budget. So far, there's no clear decision.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher supported fulfilling the district's full $5.7 million request last month and maintained that stance for the pared down ask at a budget deliberation Tuesday.\n\"We're going to have to do it sooner or later,\" Lesher said. \"I think it makes sense to do it this year and reduce the pain next year.\"\nPresident Chuck Callahan said he feels comfortable with honoring the $600,000 part of the request to cover the new positions.\nCouncil members Keasha Haythe, Lynn Mielke and Dave Stepp have all indicated they need more time to consider options.\nAny additional funding granted would result in an education supplement to the property tax rate, which is 79 cents per $100 of assessed value.\nTalbot County is already mandated by the state to pay $440,000 for teachers' pensions, which will be collected through a supplement of less than half a cent per $100 of assessed value.\nThree potential scenarios for tax supplements have been laid out by county staff:\nTeachers' pensions only: 0.0045 per $100 of assessed value.\nTeachers' pensions and $500,000 for salary increases: 0.0096 per $100 of assessed value.\nTeachers' pensions and $600,000 for new positions: 0.0106 per $100 of assessed value.\nHaythe said Tuesday she's trying to balance helping the school system with preventing tax increases for residents on fixed income, such as seniors.\n\"I am in no way, shape or form trying to discount the great work that the school system does and what the teachers do in the classroom,\" Haythe said.\nAt last week's hearing, teachers and parents advocated for the council to include the $1.1 million. Lisa Hayes, a parent of three TCPS graduates, said past education investments are paying off now as her children enter the workforce.\n\"You cannot not fund a budget for our children's education because there is nothing more important than that,\" Hayes said.\nAndy Burke, president of the Talbot County Education Association, which functions as the teachers' union, made his case.\n\"We continue to see too many educators migrate away to the higher wages and salaries paid in neighboring public school systems,\" Burke said.\nIn an emailed statement, TCPS Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said the district made \"very difficult choices\" to reduce its request to the county.\nJones noted staff will present the Board of Education with a budget amendment package in June, which will adjust the $86 million unrestricted budget the board OK'd in February.\n\"We will eliminate most of the new positions we had requested,\" Jones wrote. \"We will scale back our requests and defer programs that will have the least direct impact on our goals for our students.\"\nA final decision by the county on the $1.1 million in question, as well as the entire FY26 budget, is expected at the council's May 27 meeting.\nWhile no clear choice was made during Tuesday's deliberations, county and district leaders did agree that state mandates and formulas are creating the tricky fiscal situation.\n\"It's just become screamingly clear that there's a disconnect at the state level between the requirements that they're putting on local schools across the state, and the funding formulas that are articulated to county governments to pay for their education,\" said County Manager Clay Stamp. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The potential middle school would sit on a 23-acre parcel.\nOn that parcel, there is a solar field area that architects would have to contend with. There is also a pasture connected to the Career Center that could impact school placement and design.\nCommunity members brought forward suggestions for what the county could do with the Lockerman location if it moved next to North Caroline High. They recommended students could share bus routes with high schoolers and made safety suggestions for both schools.\nThe Double Hills road site is located near the Caroline County Sheriffs Office and Caroline County Emergency Services buildings on 76 acres. The county owns the land, and the Lockerman Committee is looking for a 21-acre portion.\nKevin Shearon, engineer for the Lockerman project, brought attention to the size and distance of the road and made considerations for what they would do to the road to make it accessible for the school.\n\"Double Hills is a 20-21 foot road with no shoulders on either side,\" Shearon said. \"So, we would consider adding shoulders, at least on the school side or the site side for ACLD cell and just a wider feel for the right.\"\nAccording to Lockerman Committee members, the public water and sewer could be extended from the Denton's systems for the potential school.\nAfter explaining both new locations, Lockerman Committee members and Superintendent Derek Simmons answered questions from residents and heard their concerns and suggestions.\n\"It was great to see the turnout,\" Simmons said. \"It was great to see the engagement, folks are really passionate about their faults, which is great. Our architects and our consultants need that information now as we're working in the very early stages of design. I'm glad they came out.\n\"There will be another opportunity on June 2, and I hope the turnout is equally as good as not better. Because the board's got a big decision to make in July, and we want to provide them with the best information we can on the sites that we're considering.\"\nThe next public meeting on potential school locations will be held on June 2 at Lockerman Middle School at 6 p.m. Following that, the committee will have a presentation to the Board of Education on July 1 about their decision. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For Caroline County Public Schools, honoring the event meant taking time to celebrate teachers and support staff.The weeklong celebration featured free coffee and visits from Caroline County district employees for every school.\n\"I feel that it is very important to recognize the teachers and support staff that works every day to make learning at our school a worthwhile and important venture for our students,\" Caroline County Board of Education President Michele Wayman said. \"We wouldn't be able to have our school opened without our support staff and our teachers.\"\nFor district teachers, the biggest takeaway from the week was the chance to reflect on why they do what they do.\n\"It's a chance to recognize the dedication, passion and hard work educators pour into their students every day. Highlighting teachers is important because they do far more than teach; they inspire, support, and help shape the future,\" Caroline County Public Schools Educators Association President Amy Bauman said.\n\"In a time when educators face growing challenges, this week reminds our community to value and uplift them.\"\nCaroline County Public Schools 2024-25 Teacher of the Year Danielle Dennis is a math teacher at Colonel Richardson High School. In addition to teaching, she is an indoor track and field coach, Class of 2025 advisor and spirit club advisor.\nDennis said she became a teacher to make a difference in students' lives in the very community she grew up in.\n\"I attended Caroline County Public Schools and graduated from Colonel Richardson High School in 2011, so I hoped to have the same influence that so many amazing educators did in my life,\" Dennis said.\nIn addition to being the President of Caroline County Public Schools Educators Association, Bauman has been a teacher for 23 years, all at Denton Elementary School.\nBauman biggest joy as a teacher is turning a new group of students into family.\n\"Seeing our bond grow as we learn together, share laughs, and lift each other up is what brings me so much joy. It's not just about lessons. It's playing kickball, making slime, publishing our very own book and showing up at their sporting events.\"\nAccording to Wayman, the teachers and support staff are \"very appreciative\" of the Teacher of the Year celebration.\n\"They're very appreciative of everything that is done to celebrate and recognize the hard work that they do,\" Wayman said. \"... I don't take any of the visions for granted. Everyone has a part they do in making the school day a beautiful day for students.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

While a handful of the speakers indicated support for the sticker removal, many expressed opposition.\nSheri Tardio of Prince Frederick called the issue \"manufactured outrage. Safe space stickers do not promote ideology. Diversity is a fact.\"\n\"You are not hiding your biases very well,\" said Stacy Tayman, president of the Calvert Association for Educational Support Staff.\n\"Removing stickers is not a violation of First Amendment rights,\" said school board President Jana Post in her closing comments, adding that the April discussion \"was twisted\" into an LGBTQ issue.\n\"Real safety comes from a culture of trust,\" Post said.\nAt the conclusion of public comments, board member Paul Harrison made a motion to discuss \"a flag policy\" at a future meeting. That policy would likely be aimed at setting parameters for displays of flags, posters and decals in school buildings. The motion passed unanimously.\nSupervisor's post\nThe school board unanimously approved the appointment of Marc Watson as supervisor of health, physical education and athletics. The Indiana University of Pennsylvania graduate is a familiar face in Calvert County where he has previously served as a teacher, coach and principal.\nMost recently, Watson served as principal of King George High School in Virginia.\nWatson told the board he was looking forward to \"continuing to create this wonderful environment of learning and athletics\" in Calvert County.\nIn recommending Watson for the appointment, Townsel said the returning administrator will provide \"training and mentorship for coaches.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Addressing that deficit meant Dorchester County schools lost after-school and summer programming.\nThe cuts to education come at a time when the county ranks 21st out of 24 school districts (including Baltimore City) in third grade literacy and 22nd out of 24 in overall English Language Arts proficiency in the state.\nThe Y is partnering with the John and Janice Wyatt Foundation to create a space for the Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading, a campaign that aims to target childhood illiteracy.\n{span}The campaign was inspired by the movie \"Sentenced,\" which was produced and narrated by NBA champion Stephen Curry. The film explores the epidemic of childhood illiteracy and its lifelong impacts.{/span}\n\"Dorchester County has, for a long time, been ranked very low in the state of Maryland,\" said Matthew Peterson, executive director of the John and Janice Wyatt Foundation. \"And so interestingly, now concurrent to all the work that the Y is doing, that we're all doing together, Dorchester County Public Schools is undergoing a strategic plan to go from 21st, to 15.\"\nThe Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading plans to approach this goal from multiple angles and with multiple partnerships.\nBecause third grade is a pivotal marker for childhood learning development, the campaign's target population are children from birth to age 5, so they are better prepared to enter kindergarten, and are less likely to fall behind.\n\"So we're trying to grab moms as prenatal because we're gonna do infant groups, we're gonna do, you know, toddler groups, mommy and me groups, so we want to bring awareness at early childhood,\" said Tynice DeShields, director of mental health at the YMCA of Chesapeake.\nThe campaign's partners include county schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson, the Dorchester County Public Library, United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, Operation Pathways and volunteers from the community.\n\"There's a number of agencies we've been working with over the years. You know, as any organization, some were more engaged than others, and so bringing everybody on board, finding out where that alignment fits best, and then trying to leverage that, to do the best we can, is what we've always tried to have,\" Peterson said.\nThe reading hub will be a space that is open to the public and YMCA members alike.\n\"We're building this reading hub as a meeting place where we can have a resource center, we can have meetings with the community, we can have sessions with the parents to teach their kids how to read, how to look at letters and numbers, and not just throw a book in front of them,\" said Bryant Wittington, director of the Dorchester County Campaign for Grade Level Reading.\nPeterson, DeShields and Wittington are excited to engage with the community and hope to build a strong foundation of volunteers at the reading hub.\n\"We want to build that unity in the community,\" Wittington said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "TCPS cuts back on summer school; board displeased with how decision was made\n\n May 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 535\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot Board of Education members expressed displeasure with cuts made to the district's summer school programs, arguing they should have been part of the decision-making process.Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi outlined Talbot County Public Schools' reduced summer programming during Wednesday's Board of Education meeting.\nSummer school will not be offered to elementary or middle school students as it had been in recent years. According to the district, summer school traditionally spanned four weeks, Mondays through Thursdays.\n\"We decided to make the decision this summer not to have summer school as we've had it prior,\" Pepukayi said. \"To take this time to really reset and to talk to our families and our students and our staff to find out what we could do to have a robust summer programming moving forward.\"\nPreviously, summer programs were funded through grants, Pepukayi said. But as pandemic-era grants have dried up, she said the district looked at cutting costs for this fiscal year. Summer school would have cost around $350,000.\nThe district will continue to have the following programs:\nMiddle school transition, or 6th Grade Academy.\nCredit recovery for high school students.\nBand camps.\nSummer Career Enrichment Program, a multi-county program held at Easton High School.\nExtended School Year for students receiving special education services.\nOn Wednesday, Board of Education members expressed disappointment that they weren't included in the decision to trim summer school.\n\"It ultimately affects a budgetary item, and the board was not asked to vote on it,\" Vice President Amy Dodson said.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said she's \"dismayed\" and \"concerned\" about how the decision was made without board input.\n\"Why weren't we told that we weren't planning for it, why weren't families told that we weren't planning for it?\" Jackson asked. \"Why did this decision come out last week to kind of surprise everybody?\n\"All of those families, all of those teachers, everybody who has counted on summer school for so long for whatever individual, personal reasons they have are now left scrambling to figure out how to pay their bills this summer, or what to do with their students.\"\nIn making the decision, Pepukayi said the district kept an eye on what nearby districts were doing.\nIn March, Dorchester County Public Schools canceled nearly all of its summer school programs as it grappled with closing a multi-million dollar deficit. DCPS Superintendent Jymil Thompson and board members shared the decision to families through a joint announcement.\nTCPS first announced the summer school cancellation in a May 1 superintendent's update newsletter, though it wasn't discussed at any open board meetings prior. A district spokesperson said the final decision was made in late April.\nResponding to board members' concerns, Pepukayi said she heard \"loud and clear\" that it should've been brought to their attention during budget season. She said the board will be included on such discussions in the future.\nAlong with voicing concerns about communication, board members touched on what students may miss out on with the cuts.\n\"I was disappointed about the summer programs being cut, because I thought that's what we had to do, especially for our (multilingual learners) to keep them going all summer,\" Ann O'Connor said.\n\"We do have students that are still experiencing a COVID gap,\" Cynthia Jurrius said. \"So that's really my number one concern, is the students who are behind.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He encouraged graduates to never fear, embrace hard work and maintain connections.\n\"Everyone has to start somewhere, and sometimes the correct way is not the easiest,\" Coppersmith said. With its legacy of watermen and farmers, the Eastern Shore is known even today for its strong work ethic, he said.\nKeynote speaker, former U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, was presented the college's Community Service Award in recognition of his service as a senior statesman, his Chesapeake Bay protection efforts, his dedication to human and civil rights, and his staunch advocacy for higher education.\n\"Graduation marks a profound turning point in your life. It is not only the culmination of hard work and dedication, but also the beginning of a new chapter filled with opportunity. What you do with that opportunity is up to you,\" Cardin said.\n\"Embrace hope,\" Cardin said, noting the student body was stronger due to its diversity. \"Never give up hope for a stronger, more inclusive, more equitable society,\" he said.\nCardin urged graduates to recognize history lessons as more than words in textbooks, but as guides on what not to do and on how ordinary individuals can be extraordinary.\n\"As graduates, you have the tools to think globally and act locally. You are the architects of a world where hope becomes reality,\" he said.\nFor her breakthroughs in pushing learning past the pages of textbooks, including unforgettable methods of blending academic rigor with applied learning and creative applications, the inaugural Adjunct Innovative Teaching Award was presented to Cherie Patchett, instructor of psychology.\nOpening eyes to the world of psychology, Patchett's impact was also noted to extend beyond the classroom, supporting students by establishing a mental health club on campus.\nPatchett encouraged graduates to embrace their individuality to innovate their lives.\nThe John T. Harrison Award was presented to 2025 graduate Cianni A. Phillips for her dedication and empathy. She exemplified true leadership qualities by developing student-focused campus communities.\nPhillips is a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society and is on the Dean's List with a 3.8 GPA.\nPhillips served on the Student Government Association, was president of the UHURU Black Student Union, and, in addition to numerous student clubs, served as a student worker in the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. She will transfer to Coppin State University in Baltimore to pursue a bachelor's degree in social work.\nLooking upon the graduating class, Phillips noted the students balanced all manner of life, including jobs and families, along with their schoolwork, to successfully earn a place at the commencement, which was more than a ceremony — it was a celebration and victory, she said.\nMoving forward, Phillips encouraged her classmates to continually build support networks, pour back into the community, and be the representation so strongly needed.\n\"Young people need to see what their futures can be,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

During the the county school board's May 22 work session, Cecelia Lewis, director of student services, presented summaries of the code of conduct and the significant changes that are proposed, including the use of AI.Lewis called the proposed references and policies related to artificial intelligence \"a huge highlight this year. Technology continues to evolve.\"\nThe \"added guidelines for use of artificial intelligence\" cover \"educational use, academic integrity, ethical use, supervision and monitoring and prohibited conduct.\"\nThe code's definition of \"academic dishonesty/cheating\" is proposed to now include \"unauthorized use of digital or AI-generated materials, sharing of local, state or federal test information.\"\nThe drafters of the code of conduct's rewrite added \"utilizing AI-generated content to harass, intimidate or bully any member of the school community\" to the bullying, harassment and intimidation definition in the document's \"levels of responses\" section.\nIn a new section of the code entitled \"responsible use of technology,\" there is a mandate listed on \"avoiding plagiarism and AI misuse.\"\nIn addressing a question asked by Grace Minakowski, the outgoing student member of the board, on allowing for the citing of artificial intelligence and deciding what work might be plagiarism, Lewis said, \"the teacher's determination\" would be the big factor. She added that an artificial intelligence course for teachers \"is being developed.\"\nBoard member Melissa Goshorn asked if artificial intelligence training for students is also being considered.\n\"That is on our radar,\" Lewis said. \"It's something we are developing.\"\nLewis said the school system's instructional department's technology supervisors will be involved in developing the training for teachers and students.\nJackie Jacobs, chief academic officer, indicated classroom teachers will be giving students direction in the use of artificial intelligence and the extent of its use will be \"dependent on what teachers are looking for.\"\nIn providing an overview on the code of conduct, Lewis told the board that many stakeholders contributed to the revisions, with a focus on assuring Calvert's public schools have a \"safe, welcoming environment.\"\nMuch of the code is guided by state law, Lewis indicated during her presentation.\nOther proposed changes include the addition of Safe Schools Maryland contact information. The free system is available to students, teachers, school staff members, parents and the general public \"to report any school or student safety concerns, including mental health concerns.\"\nJana Post, school board president, called the work Lewis and the stakeholders did on revising the code \"a humongous overhaul\" and commended the group for its work.\nThe revised code will now be posted on the school system's website until late June for public review and comments.\nHigh school theatre group lauded\nA school organization used to receiving cheers and applause was showered with more accolades May 22 as the Patuxent High School Harlequins received a recognition from the school board.\nThe citation noted the group earned a superior rating at the 2025 Maryland Thespians Festival with their production of the one-act play \"Everybody,\" by Brandon Jacobs-Jenkins. The Patuxent troupe earned the most superior scores at the recent festival.\n\"It's our tradition of unparalleled student leadership,\" Allen Price, Harlequins' production director, said after the citation was read and unanimously approved by the board. He added the program's long history of achievement was due to \"student ownership\" and \"dedication to our program. The students care about the other students' successes.\"\nEarlier this week, Price told Southern Maryland News that the Maryland State Department of Education is showcasing the Harlequins in a short documentary that focuses on the group's outstanding use of student leadership and student ownership to produce high quality shows.\nTwitter: @MartySoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Association Secretary David Kemp pointed out the rockets that day, large or small, use the same propellant as boosters on space shuttles.\nThanks to the organization's efforts, you do not need to be NASA trained to be a rocketeer.\nFor example, youth LaShawn Sudler watched his smaller rocket launch beside his step-grandfather, Mark Kraemer. It went 500-600 feet in the air, then released its chute at 200 feet.\nA kid of few words, nonetheless Sudler showed pride in his rockets. Kraemer is passing his love of rocketry down to him and has fond memories of buying rocket kits when he was Sudler's age.\n\"These are just big boy toys,\" he said. \"We love this stuff.\"\nOver in another tent, friends Rich Custer and Erin Dawson from Northern Virginia showcased their rocket made from a fencepost and ceiling fan blades.\nUnder another tent, married couple Glenn and Adrienne Ramey shared how they even turned Christmas trees into rockets that when launched, spin the whole time.\nOn the grounds, there was just a handful of rocketeers in attendance, a smaller crowd since the American Rocketry Challenge was taking place in Virginia, said Fred Wallace, president of the association. Even though the conditions were a little windy, he had his high powered rocket with him just in case things calmed.\nAlthough they were low in number that day, it offered a perfect opportunity to learn about the hobby.\nThat day, most landings were smooth although one rocket had a rough landing, the chute not deploying.\nThe association encourages all to come out to get their chance to be a rocketeer. People 18 and under fly for free. If you do not have a rocket, they have plenty to start you on your journey.\n\"Moms and dads, bring your kids,\" Wallace urged. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said during her address to the class that the school's yearbook showed just how close students and faculty were during the last four years.\n\"What stood out the most were the connections I saw,\" Pepukayi said. \"As I turned each page, I saw smiles, I saw groups of students clustered together. … I saw laughing, talking, joking taking place between the students, among students, in between staff and students.\"\nPepukayi emphasized to the graduates that creating those human connections is vital, especially in a world influenced by artificial intelligence.\n\"I read that Generation Z, who are the ages of 18 to 28, require a higher level of human connection, whether it's at home, at school, or in places of business,\" Pepukayi said. \"Human connection. Now in the AI-driven world, this is of utmost importance. And that human connection is very evident in this class.\"\nEaston High valedictorian Mia Mazzeo shared a similar theme in her speech.\n\"When all the information in the world is just a click away, take that extra step and dig deeper,\" Mazzeo said. \"An eagerness to learn and an attentive teacher is all one really needs. It is only when you question how the world works that you can truly change it.\"\nMazzeo told her classmates that wisdom comes from interactions with one another.\n\"When I look back at my time in high school, I think I grew the most during late-night conversations with friends and after school chats with teachers,\" she said. \"The experiences you share with others and the advice they have to offer is priceless.\"\nST. MICHAELS HIGH\nOn Thursday, 60 seniors at St. Michaels High School threw their caps in the air and joyously celebrated the achievement of being a newly-minted graduate.\nValedictorian Alexandria Rockwell said the Class of 2025 showed \"incredible purpose\" and encouraged her classmates to maintain that same drive as they go their separate ways.\nRockwell said the last four years tested and pushed the graduating class.\n\"As we entered high school, many challenges were thrown at us,\" she said. \"Four years felt like forever. But now we're here. It's gone by in a flash, and it's bittersweet because we looked forward to this moment for so long, but now we know we're leaving behind something we'll never quite return to.\"\nSchool principal Theresa Vener echoed that Thursday's graduation was bittersweet, bidding farewell to the graduating class she's been alongside since starting as St. Michaels Middle High School principal seven years ago.\nVener, retiring this year after 32 years working for the district, was presented with an honorary diploma at Thursday's ceremonies. Students, staff and district administrators thanked her for her dedication and leadership.\nThe outgoing principal said it was an \"absolute privilege\" to watch the Class of 2025 grow into caring and confident young adults.\n\"I have watched you fall, get back up and take those steps forward,\" Vener said. \"One step at a time, but 'always forward,' just like your class motto says.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Recipes for graduation celebrations\n\n June 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1269\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n What an exciting time of the year — graduation has once again arrived. From graduates from nursery school, to grade school, to middle school, to high school, to night school, to college, to trade school, to graduate school to just any kind of school, congratulations.As I sit here and write this column and gather materials, my mind travels back in time to when my mother went to a one-room schoolhouse outside of Selbyville, Delaware. The outhouse being behind the school was no problem, as most of the homes had the same.\nThere were only 11 grades, and mom was a member of the Class of 1928. She always told me there was no celebration as she was running a farm with her stepfather and had to get back home to work in the fields. She said that her church group celebrated all school children the previous Sunday.\nThe next graduation I remember was in June 1954, when my sister graduated from Buckingham High School in Berlin. I remember going to the graduation was a formal affair. The boys wore suits, and the girls wore \"dressy' dresses with high heels. This attire included dark graduation robes for the guys and white robes for the girls.\nA big dinner was held at our house on Sunday to celebrate, and the house was full... and so was the kitchen sink with dirty dishes waiting for \"little sister.\"\nI graduated from Stephen Decatur High School in Berlin in 1963 with a \"large class\" of 72 students. As was the norm, my parents held a large family dinner, and guess who didn't do the dishes. I went to the beach with some of my classmates.\nThe years go by, and my youngest son graduated in 1996 from Colonel Richardson High School. We had a gathering of family and friends at home with \"BBQ and Picnic\" foods. Betty Lofland, my neighbor, made a garden flag with CRHS Class of 1996 in the school colors to fly on my pole. I still have the flag.\nIn 2022, my grandson, Mason Emory Williamson, is a member of the graduating class of Parkside High School in Salisbury. The ceremony was held at the Wicomico Civic Center due to such a large class — 800 kids. Times may have changed in the past 94 years of my family's graduations, but the message is and has always been the same — \"The world is at your feet. Take it and keep going. If you fall get right back up\".\nNow I am hungry so let us fix some food for graduation celebrations.\nFRUIT KABOBS\nMy only tip here is try not to use fruits that will brown, such as bananas, apples or peaches. Think about a variety of color.\nPrep the fruit by cutting it into slices, wedges or chunks. Thread fruit onto skewers and refrigerate until eating. Make fruit kabobs ahead of time so they'll be well chilled before serving. They'll keep in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours. For an extra twist, add some whipped cream with shredded coconut as a dip. Mix however many cups of whipped topping with 2 tbsps of shredded sweetened coconut per each cup.\nGARLIC BREAD PIZZA DIPPERS\n1 can biscuit, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 cup ricotta, 4 oz cream cheese (softened), 2 cups mozzarella cheese (shredded), 1 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/3 cup marinara, 6-8 pepperoni, 3 tbsp parmesan.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut each biscuit in half and roll into a ball. Place each biscuit ball around the edge of an 8-inch skillet. In a small mixing bowl, combine olive oil and garlic powder. Mix and then brush onto biscuits. In a large mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, half of the mozzarella, Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. Mix until well combined. Pour in the middle of the skillet, spreading evenly to the edge of the biscuits. Pour marinara on top of the cheese mixture and spread it evenly across the top of it. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella on top of the marinara and place pepperoni on top. Place in oven and bake for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle parmesan on top. Serve hot. This recipe makes eight. Adjust accordingly to how ever many guests you are having.\nSLOW COOKER BBQ PULLED PORK SANDWHICHES\n1 lemon-garlic pork loin filet (about 1-1/3 pounds), 1 can (12 ounces) Dr Pepper, 1 bottle of your favorite barbecue sauce, 6 hamburger buns (split).\nPlace pork in a 3-qt slow cooker. Pour Dr Pepper over top. Cover and cook on low for 7-9 hours or until meat is tender. Remove meat; cool slightly. Discard cooking juices. Shred meat with 2 forks and return to the slow cooker. Stir in barbecue sauce; heat through. Serve on buns. You can also make this with chicken for a pulled chicken variation.\nCHEESEBURGER SLIDERS\n1/2 cup mayonnaise, 2 tbsps ketchup, 1 tbsp yellow mustard, 24 slider rolls (I use King's Hawaiian), 2 tbsps olive oil, 1 medium onion, (small diced), 2 pounds lean ground beef, 1 (1 ounce) package dry French Onion Soup Mix, 1 tbsp steak seasoning (I used Montreal), 10 slices American cheese, 24 pickle slices, 2 tbsps butter (melted), 1 tbsp sesame seeds.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line an 11-by-15-inch baking dish with foil and coat lightly with nonstick spray. Set aside. Slice the slider rolls in half, and place the bottoms evenly into the prepared pan, setting the tops aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard. Set aside. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions and cook, until soft and golden, stirring frequently. Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until no pink remains, breaking the meat while cooking. Drain any excess fat from the skillet. Add in the onion soup mix and the steak seasoning, stirring to combine. Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the mayonnaise mixture and coat the meat evenly. Spread the meat mixture evenly on top of the slider rolls. Top with cheese slices, cutting to fit, if necessary. Top each with a pickle slice. Place the slider roll tops on top and press down slightly. Brush the melted butter on top of the sliders, and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Cover the pan tightly with foil. Place the pan on a large cookie sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted. Remove the pan from the oven and keep covered for 5-10 minutes before uncovering and serving. Store airtight in the refrigerator until serving, no longer than 24 hours to preserve taste and freshness of rolls.\nANTIPASTO KABOBS\n1 package (9 ounces) refrigerated cheese tortellini, 40 pimiento-stuffed olives, 40 large pitted ripe olives, 3/4 cup Italian salad dressing, 40 thin slices pepperoni, 20 thin slices hard salami (halved).\nCook tortellini according to package directions; drain and rinse in cold water. In a large bowl, combine the tortellini, olives and salad dressing. Toss to coat; cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Drain mixture, discarding marinade. For each appetizer, thread a stuffed olive, a folded pepperoni slice, tortellini, a folded salami piece and a ripe olive on a toothpick or short skewer.\nRAINBOW SHERBET PUNCH\n1 gallon Breyers brand sherbet (rainbow flavored if you can find) 1 liter 7UP/Sprite/ginger ale, 1 liter of Hawaiian punch or a favorite juice of your choice, Whipped cream (optional).\nIn a large punch bowl scoop in your ice cream. Pour soda over the ice cream and break ice cream apart gently while pouring slowly then add in your juice and mix slightly to incorporate. Serve in tall glasses with a dollop of whipped cream. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Lockerman Middle School Committee heard and addressed concerns at second meeting\n\n June 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 634\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — At the Lockerman Middle School Committee meeting Monday night, Robyn Toth, architect for the new Lockerman Middle School, confirmed that after the state's assessment, the current Lockerman Middle School building cannot be renovated, and the county will go with a new building.\"We've already reached out to the state and said the renovation of this existing facility as a school is not feasible,\" Toth said at the meeting. \"It is my understanding that (the current school is) going to become a community center. So, this building is going to stay. It's going to keep its history.\"\nThough it was never indicated as a preferred option, staying at the current site and renovating was left on the table at prior committee meetings and discussions on the new school.\nThe May meeting featured two potential locations for a new school, the first location would be behind North Caroline High School, and the second would be on Double Hills Road in Denton.\nAfter a public hearing at that meeting, the committee came back with models and options for the school at two potential new locations.\n\"There was a lot of feedback last time about the safety issue for buses coming and going, as well as parent drop off,\" Superintendent Derek Simmons said. \"So, I think the architect did the best they could with the two existing locations that the county has told us to look at to kind of make them as usable as possible.\"\nThe presentation given Monday premiered three building layout options for the North Caroline High location and two options for the Double Hills Road location.\nThe North Caroline High design options included two plans for a two-story style building with wings separated by grade level. Though these designs for the building itself are identical, the building is located in different places on the lot in each design.\nOne option proposes relocating the North Caroline High baseball and softball fields to a different location. The other keeps the middle school on the left and everything belonging to the high school on the right side of the property.\nThe third design option would also involve relocating the fields and would also relocate the solar array on the site. The existing barn and fenced pasture would also be rebuilt in a new location.\nThis third option is a three-story building design, with each floor being a different grade level.\n\"The different locations on North Carolina High School was interesting,\" Simmons said. \"I think most of us in our heads ahead of time could envision it in one spot, but giving the flexibility of the options really opened up some some pathway.\"\nThe Double Hills Road location designs featured the two- and three-story options as at the North Caroline location.\nWhile both options propose that the solar panels currently at the site may need to be located another portion of the county property and that new pump station will need to be constructed, entrance options, building locations and parking locations are different.\n\"Double Hills Road with the new county road going in in that property does preserve a 20 plus acre plot for to use,\" Simmons said. \"It's good location but again it gives us that flexibility now to see what the buses would look like coming and going. What drop off would look like, what staff parking would look like because there's nowhere near enough staff parking here as well.\"\nNow that the Lockerman Middle School Committee has presented all options, the public will have until before June 9 to respond to an online survey with their comments.\nThe top ranked designs for both locations will be presented to the Caroline County Board of Education in July. Then the Board of Education will make a decision on a location no later than August to make sure the timeline for construction stays on track.\nTo participate in the survey, visit carolineschools.org/article/2241492.\n. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Stroke of pen loses 75 years of science leadership\n\n June 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 713\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. higher educational system may in future years lose $38 billion a year. This is the estimated annual contribution by foreign students. In the school year 2023-2024 it was estimated that 1.1 million foreign students were studying at universities across the U.S., and they generally pay full fare or do work/study. They supported about 378,000 academic jobs.Now we risk driving them away.\nOn April 19, CNN reported that thousands of international students across the country were informed by email that their student visas were revoked. Six days later the Trump administration decided to restore 1,400 student visas. How many students did not have their visas restored is unknown. We do know that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had a list of about 300 students that he planned to expel. The National Immigration Project is challenging the visa cancellations in court.\nApart from the money that these foreign students bring in, why would we care? Because foreign students began many of the successful startups in Silicon Valley. We care because much research in science done at our universities has brought the U.S. to a revered leadership position in the world in medical science research.\nWith a stroke of the president's pen this may all disappear. The best brains in the world will not want to come here anymore. Research in advanced cancer treatments, drugs to treat Alzheimer, sudden crib deaths as well as CRISPRs use in treating genetic blood disorders by cutting out a person's faulty DNA will not continue without federal support. The U.S. inventors of CRISPR won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2020. We will be taking a giant step backward in the sciences.\nIn the 20th century up to World War II, Germany won about 30% of the Nobel Prizes in science. The second runner-up was Great Britain with 20% of the Nobel Prizes in science. The U.S. was way down the list with only 6% of the Nobel Prizes in science.\nWhat turned the tide was Adolf Hitler who drove many of the best German scientists, artists and architects (some of them Jewish) to U.S. universities in the 1930s, where they were welcomed. The second German brain drain happened immediately after the war when U.S. intelligence invited physicists like Wernher von Braun (inventor of the German rockets) to the U.S. to work for the space program. The U.S. emerged from the war economically, technologically and militarily better than the rest of the world.\nWhat really propelled the U.S. into today's leadership position was the futuristic vision of what could come, if the U.S. government funded basic research at universities small and large around the country with a promise to keep the government's hands off. The academic freedom and competition created by this decision attracted the best brains from around the world.\nSince 2000, the U.S. has won 72 Nobel Prizes in science, of which about 30% were won by immigrants. Great Britain won 16, Germany 7, France 5, Japan 9, Israel 5. Canada, Australia.and Norway won three each.\nThis rosy picture will change fast if the Trump administration continues to threaten leading universities with withdrawal of funds and academic freedom. Harvard University, which so far has not backed down, was threatened with cancellation of its not-for-profit designation. $2 billion in research grants were withdrawn by the administration. Foreign students' and researchers' visas are being revoked. 27% of the students are from abroad. Attacking an elite university may appeal to the MAGA base, but it is still difficult to understand why President Trump wants to destroy the foremost academic institution in the US!\nThe Trump administration also is threatening withdrawal of funds from our other world-renowned science research facilities, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. A science publication asked its readers if they were affected by government harassment and withdrawal of funds. If so, were they considering moving their research elsewhere? 75% of the 1,600 who responded said they were considering it.\nWith a stroke of the president's pen, we have lost 75 years of leadership in the sciences.\nCalifornia, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York will see the most economic impact. Maryland also will suffer, as we are home to Johns Hopkins Hospital, the site of original cancer research and treatment, and the University of Maryland Medical Center with its world-renowned Shock Trauma Center. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She plans to attend Towson University and major in nursing starting in the fall. She will already be multiple semesters ahead.\nEnnals' love for health care came during her freshman year of high school, but she decided she wanted to be a neonatal intensive care unit nurse during her sophomore year.\n\"When I just like actually sat down and was able to research and just gather data on all these different branches, that's what really like sealed the deal for me,\" she said.\nEnnals is not the first child of her mother, Maria Bowser, to participate in the dual enrollment program at Chesapeake College. Ennals' two older sisters participated in the program in Talbot County, both graduating with a plethora of college credits to pursue nursing.\nEnnals knew from watching her sisters complete dual enrollment classes that the workload was difficult, but she knew she was up to the task.\nEnnals said she faced challenges getting enrolled in the courses she needed.\nAfter an auditorium presentation with all juniors at North Caroline explaining dual enrollment options, Ennals went to her guidance counselor to talk about the process of doing dual enrollment and potentially graduating from Chesapeake College before graduating from high school.\n\"I tried to bring it up to my guidance counselor and they kind of deterred me from taking the dual enrollment classes, and that's when we decided to have a meeting about that and that's what got me into those classes,\" Ennals said.\n\"My guidance counselor told me that it was going to be too hard for me, which I was very confused as to why they would think that because I was already ahead when I first came to that school.\"\nBowser and Ennals met with counselors at North Caroline for several weeks about what course work would be best for Ennals.\n\"If she wants to be a nurse, and she knows she's going to college, college classes are the better path for her. However, we got a little pushback,\" Bowser said.\nA representative from Caroline County Public Schools said the district was unable to discuss conversations between students, parents and employees.\nAfter more pushback, Bowser and Ennals began to work with the Gabrilla Moreland, TRIO Upward Bound academic coordinator, and Mark Berry, director of TRIO program at Chesapeake College.\nThe TRIO Upward Bound program offers high school students from Caroline, Kent and Talbot counties an opportunity to gain college and career readiness skills, through tutoring, workshops and field trips at no cost to students.\nThe group set down with county Board of Education and came up with a plan to allow Enalls to take four college classes during her junior year of high school.\n\"I wasn't taking the 'no she can't take classes because it's too hard.' How was it too hard? She had a 4.0, and she was managing everything and had all of her high-school credits by her 11th grade year,\" Bowser said.\nEnnals said it became a \"prove them wrong type of situation.\"\n\"I loved it because it was a lot of motivation knowing that there were education officials telling me that I can't do something. So I just used that as motivation to just let me get through it. Let me kind of not only prove to myself but also prove to them,\" Ennals said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Board members said the debt likely stems from families choosing not to pay or failing to submit annual free/reduced lunch forms.\nThe school system did not respond for more information by deadline.\n\"These are families who make above whatever the threshold is to qualify and they are able to pay for lunch. They are able to pack their student's lunch. … There are options,\" board member Jamila Smith said. \"It's a choice just not to pay.\"\nThe board provided school principals lists of students with outstanding balances to contact families, encouraging repayment plans and assisting with lunch forms.\n\"And we do recognize that families are in different situations now, given that there are work closures, reductions in force, a variety of things that are happening,\" Smith said. \"But this has been going on well before that even began.\"\nBoard member Samichie Thomas emphasized the importance of filling out the lunch forms every year, or the school does not know if a family qualifies for the program that reimburses the school system for low-income students' lunches.\n\"I was a parent of four. You get all these forms and all these things at the beginning of the school year,\" Thomas said. \"Make sure you take the time to fill out the form because that's how the school can help you. … You can do it online.\"\nThe board is now considering stronger actions, including possibly sending unpaid debts to collections. The board will revisit the issue in July once the end-of-year payment window closes and final figures are available, giving families until end of June to pay their outstanding balance.\nFor now, board members are stressing outreach at every level to make families aware.\nBoard member Dottery Butler-Washington said, \"You have to say something three or four times for somebody to actually get it.\"\nThe full transfer plan vote is set for July when actual figures replace projections.\nNew substitute bus wages OK'dThe school board unanimously approved a raise for substitute bus drivers, boosting hourly wages.\nNew wages will be between $20 and 22.50, up $2.50 per hour. The increase, tied to 2026 budget, keeps pay competitive with full-time drivers and will cost an estimated $20,000 extra. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Despite the weather, the event had drawn over 1,000 attendees by noon, which was rapidly approaching last year's 1,200 attendee total, according to North East Library Branch Manager Jennifer Carter.\n\"In my opinion, it's the best thing we do all year,\" said Carter.\nEach family selected a free book upon arrival, and then was free to speak to the many children's authors present, or take part in the numerous activities on offer. These ranged from magic shows to facepainting to musical performances.\nLocal author Annette Whipple, a former Elkton and North East resident who now lives in nearby Oxford, Pa., said that the change in venue didn't seem to affect the enthusiasm at the event.\n\"It's been incredible. The families have turned out in full,\" Whipple said. \"Although we are inside, it hasn't dampened our spirts at all.\"\nWhipple, whose bibliography features such titles as \"Woof! The Truth About Dogs\" and \"Scurry! The Truth About Spiders\", writes what she calls \"fact-filled, fun\" books.\n\"I think facts are fun,\" said Whipple. \"So I write nonfiction for kids. And I love animals.\"\nWhile many of the activities and authors were popular among attendees, little could compare to the crowds near the water ice and ice cream trucks that set up shop on the street.\nMembers of the Dolly Parton Imagination Library were present at the event, helping families sign up for the program and conducting surveys of members. According to them, the festival was a great example of the Imagination Library's mission to get kids reading at a young age.\n\"The crowd here shows the county's families are interested,\" said Sharon Rosenberg. \"It's a tribute to the libraries themselves. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline commissioners weigh potential locations for new Lockerman Middle\n\n June 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 666\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — During the Caroline County Commissioners' open comment report Tuesday morning, Commissioners Vice President Larry Porter brought up the discussion on Lockerman Middle School's proposed locations.Porter said he preferred that the new middle school go on the North Caroline High School property, one of two locations being considered during the design processes for the building begin. The other location, near the county sheriff's office on Double Hills Road, presents several challenges, Porter said.\n\"I think at this point I would like to say that I am in favor of the North Carolina location as opposed to being built in town,\" Porter said.\nCommissioners Frank Bartz agreed with Porter and cited traffic and safety concerns on Route 404.\nThe commissioners also had discussions about the school's location at their meeting two weeks ago.\nAt that meeting, County Administrator Kathleen Freeman presented the two location options. Commissioners President Travis Breeding sparked a conversation about how much sway the commissioners have over the school's location.\n\"How much influence do the commissioners actually have over where the school gets constructed?\" Breeding asked two weeks ago. \"As part of the funding of this, other than a survey, we haven't really been consulted.\"\nBreeding then explained the issues they would run into with each potential location.\n\"From what I gather, it seemed like a lot of people really preferred the Double Hills location. But, with Double Hills, we've got to work out a ton of details with the Town of Denton as far as sewer, water allocation for that to work, potentially pump station upgrades,\" Breeding said.\nHe then mentioned traffic issues on Route 404 with beach traffic towards the end of the school year and students from northern county towns like Marydale, who would have to take the bus a long distance to the potential Double Hills location.\nPorter, said he didn't recall that \"the county did not have a lot of input\" on the design of new county buildings in the past.\nFreeman assured Breeding that the county will be involved with the full feasibility study for both sites to determine which site makes the most sense.\nBreeding also brought forward discussion of how much influence the commissioners will have for the design of the school.\n\"Then also, how much input do we have over the the design?\" Breeding asked. \"I mean, we don't want a situation where we're building something that's way more expensive than it needs to be or making it as functional as we can and keeping the cost as low as we can.\"\nBartz raised an issue where if the county has to build a new detention center, a school on the Double Hills Road site would cause a problem. The Caroline County Sheriff's Office is located near that Double Hills Road site, making the location logical for a detention center, he said.\nThe county is in talks with Queen Anne's County about a new 388-bed regional detention center that would house all Caroline, Queen Anne's and Kent county prisoners. After conversations about control and cost of the center, discussions between the three counties have slowed down.\nLockerman name\nPorter pointed out conversation that are being had about the Lockerman's name staying at the location of the current building instead of being attached to the new school.\nThough the existing building will no longer be used as a school when the new school is built, Porter said he was in favor of keeping the Lockerman name attached to the facility in the interest of honoring its history.\n\"I think it's going to be important that the history of the school and the name of Lockerman be retained,\" he said. \"I don't know what the future use is going to be for that building, but it's important, I think, from the alumni standpoint, from the community standpoint, that the history be be kept there for whatever use is going to be done in the future.\"\nBreeding suggested drafting a letter of intent to the Caroline County Board of Education stating that it would be the commissioners' intention to retain the name of the building. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Foundation of HOPE's new building to expand middle school girls program\n\n June 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 559\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Since 2017, the Foundation of HOPE has grown into a beloved nonprofit in the Easton community, building bright futures for middle school girls. Soon, the foundation will have its own building.A project to create a dedicated Foundation of HOPE space on the corner of South Washington and South streets is moving along after the Easton Planning Commission approved its site plan Tuesday.\nFounder and President Keasha Haythe remembers comments made by the first girls she welcomed into the organization's after-school program eight years ago.\n\"They said, 'Ms. Keasha, are we going to have our own space?'\" recalled Haythe, who also serves on the Talbot County Council.\nA building wasn't always in the cards, Haythe said, but in 2020, she and the nonprofit's board realized a separate space could be beneficial. Since schools shut down, and that's where the program's classes took place, the program was put on hold during the pandemic.\n\"If something like this happens again, it would be better if we have our own space,\" Haythe said.\nFor nearly a decade, the foundation has brought on a cohort of sixth grade girls each spring to engage in programming on economic development, entrepreneurship and self-confidence. The girls are followed through high school, and some that are heading off to college receive scholarships.\nThe after-school program would typically take place in Easton Middle School. Most recently, Haythe's nonprofit added St. Michaels Middle School and 10 students to the cohort.\nNow, the Foundation of HOPE is planning its own 5,200-square-foot, two-story building. It's a $2.2 million project, with over $1.8 million already raised, Haythe said. Construction could begin as soon as September.\nOnce it opens, girls from Easton Middle would be within walking distance to attend the after-school program, and Haythe hopes for St. Michaels students to be bussed to Easton. Expansion will occur, too.\n\"I've had parents reach out from private schools as well,\" Haythe said. \"I do believe the building will allow us to open it up to those that may be home-schooled as well.\"\nPlanning Commission members complimented the design work done by the Foundation of HOPE and architect Crosby & Associates, saying it fit the commercial character of South Washington Street but didn't stick out too much from the residential homes on South Street.\n\"Fantastic job with this site design,\" said Vice Chair Michael Ports. \"It's a perfect transition to these two different areas. It's quite awesome.\"\nDuring discussion, some concerns about safety were raised, stemming from the South Washington and South streets vehicular intersection and the fact there aren't marked crosswalks.\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh said independent of the project, the town is aware of those safety concerns and is looking to improve the intersection for pedestrians, bicyclists and vehicles.\nWhile the nonprofit has obtained OKs from the Planning and Historic District Commissions, Haythe noted there are still steps left in the approval process, including permits.\nBut the building may soon be a reality for future cohorts of girls. Along with office space, Haythe envisions a reading room, fun area, cooking lessons and much more for the sixth graders. And it could help spark even more excitement from the students once they have a building to call the Foundation of HOPE home.\n\"For them to come to the classroom for the after-school program, it's asking a lot of them to stay in that building until we're done with our sessions,\" Haythe said. \"This will break that up.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bonnie Shively, pastor of St. Paul's, came up with the idea as a way to serve the community.\n\"I've never done any school drive or a shoe drive before,\" Shively said. \"I was talking with a couple other folks, and we were kicking around the idea of maybe doing a backpack drive. So, that led to a conversation of wondering what kind of school supplies the kids need at the beginning of the year.\"\nShively then contacted Greensboro Elementary to see what supplies would be needed and got the answer of new shoes for students.\n\"One of the things that was shared is that so many kids start out the school year, the kids don't get new school shoes like a lot of us did when we were growing up. So, that's kind of how it came about and it's a unique idea,\" Shively said.\nThe church is accepting new shoes from sizes 7 toddler to size 6 adults. The only shoes that will not be accepting are flip flops.\nShively said the church is excited to do something for the community and hopes the shoe drive will be positive.\n\"I think it's a really good feeling when we can help out the kids,\" Shively said. \"Certainly, getting the various groups together in the community to come together put this drive together. We're already looking at where this will lead us in regard to what are some other areas that we can partner together for our community.\"\nResidents can drop off new shoes at Greensboro Town Hall from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Monday through Friday until Aug. 29. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The board decided to push the decision back to the August meeting.\nMultiple reasons came forward on why the North Caroline High site was recommended over the Double Hills Road site.\n\"Some of the highlights that came out throughout the analysis and the surveys was again, the infrastructure. If you're not spending a lot of money on that, the site readiness, the educational alignment, a lot of really exciting ideas came out during the community meeting of ways that you could really have mentorships and things like that with the older and the younger students being on one site,\" said Robyn Toth, architect for the new school.\nReason included the use for indoor and outdoor activities and the ability to share space for events at North Caroline High.\n\"There's clear paths for the indoor and outdoor activities,\" Toth said. \"There's no crossing of streets, lots of capabilities there also because you are sharing more spaces… There were some concerns about large events and right now, if they're at Double Hills or if they're at Lockerman now, where do we go for these large events? That don't happen that often and you don't necessarily need to build more space that the state's not going to support. Well, you've got a high school right there that's got a large auditorium. It's got a large gym.\"\nWith the North Caroline High location, development prices will be about $500,000 cheaper. The site development for the North Caroline High location will be $10 million, while Double Hills Road would cost $10.5 million.\nAlthough in the community meetings multiple builds were shown, the new middle school, regardless of the location, will be a two-story building with a two-wing design.\nAccording to the Ed Specs Committee Powerpoint, the new anticipated project budget would be $103.82 million with state funding coming in at around $80 million and local funding covering the remainder.\nThe only concerns brought up about the North Caroline High site were the solar array on the property and the traffic Central Avenue could receive from a new school being added to the location.\nTo purchase the solar panels on the property, it would cost about $180,000, which doesn't include the cost of relocation.\nThe Board of Education will take all the information received and make a decision on what location will be picked at its August meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

To further reduce the deficit, DCPS got rid of their after school and summer programs.\nThe county had to reduce staff sizing, but Superintendent Jymil Thompson said he wants to keep class sizes small and retain teachers at all costs.\nThe Board of Education has been making concerted efforts to move DCPS from 23rd out of 24 school districts — including Baltimore City — in state education ranking, but the federal funding cuts make those efforts more difficult.\n\"Moving forward, we will be proactively looking closely at unique ways to reallocate pre-existing funds to support the inclusion of these federally funded programs which are a major asset to Dorchester County Public Schools and the enrichment of its students,\" O'Bier said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After the discussion the commissioners talked about Lockerman Middle School and the next steps.\n\"I think it'd be good for us to say that we are working together on the Lockerman Middle School construction,\" Commissioners President Travis Breeding said. \"We were asking questions about what role the commissioners officially play in siting and construction, they were just questions that we were asking. It wasn't like the Board of Ed's going to run all over us and make crazy stupid decisions and we're going to be stuck with it. It was just what influence do we have over the process.\"\nBreeding explained the consensus the commissioners have come to on their personal choice for the new school location.\n\"I think we talked about it, and our consensus is that the most logical place to put it is probably next to North Carolina High School for us,\" Breeding said. \"We understand that there's a whole process that has to be going through, fact finding, the Board of Ed will review that and make their decisions based off of that. But we were just saying that that questioning what influence we actually had over the process.\"\nSimmons clarified they understand the commissioners wanting understanding of their role and told the commissioners how the process will go.\n\"Board of Education selects the site,\" Simmons said. \"The feasibility study, which was presented to the board on July 1st, indicated North Caroline High School was the better of the two locations. We did review the two sites that we were asked to review that were basically the county-owned, which is cost efficient way to do it.\nSimmons said the board received the feasibility study that night and should be making its decision on a site at the August meeting. He added the site selection does not include picking what the design of the building will be.\nAfter looking over potential designs for the new Lockerman Middle School, Breeding suggested having athletic facilities have their own location and not sharing fields.\n\"One of the major things that stuck out with me was, relocating the athletic facilities around there,\" Breeding said. \"If we can get dedicated facilities so we're not sharing space like we have been doing forever, where lacrosse or soccer is using the outfield of the softball and the baseball field, if we can actually get dedicated space, that would be a priority of mine.\"\nHe noted that facilities in surrounding counties should be studied.\n\"We've got one bite at the apple here, let's get it right,\" Breeding said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Closing gaps': TCPS data shows some literacy, math improvements\n\n July 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 586\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Test score data from last school year is showing key math and English improvements for some Talbot County students, according to school officials.Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi presented data sets to the Board of Education last week. She's especially pleased with jumps for the district's Black and Hispanic students.\n\"We are closing gaps and moving the needle on the subgroups,\" Pepukayi said in an interview.\nSchool data from the Measures of Academic Progress, or MAP, testing program shows 68% of kindergarten students scored in the 50th percentile or above in math in the 2024-2025 school year. That's up from 54% the year prior.\nThe percent of students, sorted by grade, meeting or exceeding that 50th percentile for the math and ELA tests mostly increased across the board. Dips were seen for third and fifth graders in ELA performance.\nAnd in subgroups, there were many green arrows for Black and Hispanic students. For instance, both Black and Hispanic third graders saw a 31% year-to-year jump in testing at the 50th percentile mark or above in math, and a 21% year-to-year increase for that same mark in ELA.\n\"I'm really glad to see such improvement in the Latino and Black community. That's huge,\" said Board Member Deborah Bridges at the July 16 meeting.\nPepukayi attributes the hikes, in part, to improved curriculum and the dedication of Talbot County's teachers.\n\"I can't pinpoint to say that was it, but I think we're on the right track of students learning skills that are aligned to standards,\" Pepukayi said. \"And we're looking at students being proficient on standards versus just getting a grade.\"\nThe tests discussed at last week's board meeting included MAP testing and the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skill test. Statewide test scores typically are released in August or September.\nDIBELS scores weren't drastically different from the year prior. A higher percentage of rising first and third graders tested above the literacy benchmark in 2024-2025 than 2023-2024, but second graders above the benchmark dropped by 5%.\nIn the MAP testing, the percent of fifth graders meeting the 50th percentile for ELA dropped by 6.6%. That decrease was mirrored by ELA drops for fifth graders in the following subgroups: Hispanic students, students with disabilities, multilingual students and students on free and reduced meals.\nData also shows this year's incoming sixth-grade class performed 4.1% worse in ELA in fifth grade than they did in fourth grade.\n\"Fifth graders are the kids that didn't get to finish kindergarten because of COVID,\" noted Board Vice President Amy Dodson.\nPepukayi said the next step is to fix those trends by focusing on the elementary-to-middle transition. She said in an interview that TCPS is vying to fill open reading and math coach positions for the middle schools — roles that have been beneficial at the elementary schools.\n\"That's what we're working on,\" Pepukayi said. \"I would say that's probably the challenge, of getting our staff and finding the staff to really do the interventions needed in the middle-school levels.\"\nShe emphasized that schools are collecting data on a smaller, classroom scale in order to know what's working and what's not.\n\"While we still have work to do, I think we do have to celebrate the small wins,\" Pepukayi said.\nBoard President Emily Jackson thanked Pepukayi and administrators for diving deeper into the year-to-year trends.\n\"We have been asking for these kind of results for a long time,\" said Jackson, who's served on the board since 2018. \"And the way that you showed up with the full transparent picture of what is happening in our schools, I think is really important.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot, Kent see rise in student homelessness\n\n July 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 674\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — State numbers show youth homelessness on the rise in parts of the Eastern Shore. Local shelters aiding families and single parents are noticing similar trends.Data from the Maryland State Department of Education shows Kent and Talbot counties had the largest year-to-year increase, by percentage, of students experiencing homelessness.\nIn the 2022-2023 school year, Kent County reported 66 homeless students; in 2023-2024, it took a 55% jump to 102 students. Talbot County's increase rate was 39%; 233 students experienced homelessness in 2022-2023, and 324 students in 2023-2024.\nCounts for 2024-2025 haven't yet been released — the most recent data was published in February — but leaders of nonprofit shelters have been seeing the increases in recent months.\n\"We are definitely seeing an increase in calls for families needing shelter,\" said Julie Lowe, executive director of Talbot Interfaith Shelter.\nLast school year, Easton-based Talbot Interfaith housed 31 children, Lowe said. That's a \"steady increase,\" she noted, though the shelter is limited on how many families it can help due to high demand, requirements for shelter residents and bedroom sizes.\nJust three of Maryland's 24 districts saw a year-to-year drop in student homelessness, state data shows. The counts are collected as required by the federal McKinney-Vento Act, which ensures students experiencing homelessness receive an education.\nA reason for the increase in Kent County is that school staff are better trained to identify the students defined as homeless under the McKinney-Vento Act, according to Kent County Public Schools spokesperson Dan Divilio.\n\"Homelessness in Kent County looks different from the common perception of someone living on the street or in a car,\" Divilio wrote in an email. \"Unhoused students often still have a roof over their head at night, but it may belong to an extended family member or a family friend.\"\nDivilio added that in addition to free school meals and the efforts of social workers and counselors, the district maintains partnerships with local organizations that serve families and children in need.\nTalbot County Public Schools officials say the pandemic has played a role in the increased count.\n\"The number of students experiencing homelessness is generally a reflection of the current economic climate in the nation, state, and region,\" a statement from the district read. \"The increase from SY 22-23 to SY 23-24, which is evident in the data for nearly all Maryland School Districts, was largely due to economic challenges faced by many families following the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\nIn Talbot, around 7% of students are homeless under the McKinney-Vento report, per state enrollment data. Nearly 6% of Kent County's 1,700-plus students experienced homelessness.\nThose marks in other Eastern Shore districts like Dorchester (3.6%), Queen Anne's (2.9%) and Caroline (2.2%) are lower, but the need to help the youth still remains, nonprofit leaders say.\nStefanie Johnson, executive director of the Denton-based shelter His Hope Ministries, has seen an increase in families and single parents seeking assistance, too.\nThe McKinney-Vento data for Kent County doesn't come as a shock to her. And Divilio, the KCPS spokesperson, noted that the district's count for 2024-2025 is 108 children, including children enrolled K-12 and toddlers in the district's early learning programs.\n\"Absolutely a lot more calls coming to us from Kent County, so I'm not really surprised by that unfortunately,\" Johnson said.\nShelters on the Eastern Shore are moving to assist homeless youth, but helping that age range comes with its own unique set of obstacles.\nJohnson said a specific challenge in the 13- to 18-year-old range is that her shelter can't take on children without some sort of guardianship or family present.\n\"With that 18 to 25 (age range), it's a little easier to kind of help them navigate,\" Johnson said.\nLowe said the Talbot Interfaith Shelter serves many single parents — some of them with two or three kids. The shelter offers life skills and job readiness assistance, as well as a transitional program for people to begin paying partial rent before being able to graduate to full payments.\nBut with the murky affordability of rentals in the area, Lowe said it's not always easy for families to make that transition.\n\"Homelessness is a housing problem,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In 1931, the school was named after Joseph H. Lockerman, a Black educator who was born 1862 near Denton.\nThe school remained Joseph H. Lockerman High School until 1966, when the school closed its doors as a Black high school and became the integrated Riverview Middle School.\nThe Lockerman name was restored in 1993 at a Lockerman Middle School pre-dedication ceremony, which highlighted the history of Lockerman School.\nThe president of the Caroline County Board of Education at the time was George W. Fisher. William D. Brown was president of the Concerned Friends of Lockerman, the forerunner of the current Lockerman Schools Association Inc.\nThe Lockerman Schools Association Inc. was established in 1993 as a nonprofit to engage in educational, literary or charitable activities that benefit students who have ties to any of the Lockerman Schools.\nWoods described the process of planning Saturday's event as honoring the past and addressing the present.\n\"You sort of share the vision, the idea, brainstorm with individuals and then begin to establish It's a working plan,\" Woods said. \"...Then we look at some things we want to recognize and honor. If you look at our theme, capturing our history what other kinds of things are happening or we're experiencing that we can bring to the forefront, so that our members and the community in general are aware and some of those were highlighted during the presentation of awards and certificates.\"\nMembers of classes 1935, 1945, 1955 and 1965 came to celebrate class anniversaries.\nWhile some members weren't able to attend, family members or friends accepted plaques and small trophies on their behalf. Caroline County and Board of Education officials attended the anniversary event.\nThe Lockerman Association also presented 13 scholarships to Caroline County students pursing higher education. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This could be circle time, like in preschools, or learning in small group interactions like sharing.\n\"Having that opportunity for social interaction and developing meaningful peer relationships is really important, especially at the preschool level,\" Marshall said.\nDuring a child's first visit, SPARKS ABA does an initial assessment, which tells them how many hours a week a child needs to visit.\nPrograms aim to change the trajectory of a child's learning so they can catch up to their peers with the duration of treatment being measured in six-month increments.\n\"We want to try and get as many learning opportunities in as possible,\" Marshall said. \"The goal that we have is therapy to be part of their everyday life.\"\nApplied behavioral analysis looks at three things, Marshall said.\n\"Applied\" considers problems or skills people have and looks for solutions based on positive teaching opportunities. SPARKS ABA takes guidance from science to inform their practice.\n\"Behavior\" looks at things SPARKS ABA can see and measure. They focus on the individual, which includes looking at social interactions, language and navigating sensory issues.\n\"Analysis\" evaluates data on the child to ensure the goals that were selected are changing.\n\"We know we're doing a good job when we've worked ourselves out of a job,\" Marshall said.\nSPARKS ABA plans to have a Halloween-themed \"Truck-or-Treat\" open house on Oct. 25 from noon to 2 p.m.\nFor more information about the business, visit www.sparksaba.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Increased community presence at rescue centers can positively impact adoption rates and generate greater awareness and support for these organizations.\"\nAccording to Gruver, school officials also reached out to local shelters housing dogs, cats and smaller animals, who graciously declined \"due to staffing constraints and high intake numbers.\"\n\"It shows the students really caring about the animals,\" Melissa Huffman, supervisor of elementary English language arts, said.\n\"We're trying to do more outreach within the community,\" Beth Meader, the secretary of the Freedom Hill Horse Rescue board said. Of the Read to the Animals program, she added, \"It's a win-win for the children.\"\n\"The kids seem to enjoy it and the horses seem to enjoy it,\" Lori Harrington, Freedom Hill's board president, said.\nIn its mission statement, the nonprofit's members affirm their dedication to \"rescuing horses from neglect, abuse, abandonment and slaughter. We strive to improve the lives of horses by providing a haven for healing and rehabilitation.\"\nFounded 21 years ago, Freedom Hill Horse Rescue is located on the grounds of historic Hampton Manor.\nReaching out to youth and adult organizations, Harrington said, has become a major focus at Freedom Hill. In addition to public schools, the organization also partners with homeschool groups, Scouts, first responders and veterans organizations.\nFreedom hill hosts \"about two or three programs a month,\" Harrington said, adding that no programs are held during cold weather months.\nMeader said there is hope the reading initiative might inspire some of the participants to consider volunteering when they are older. A Freedom Hill volunteer must be 13 or older.\nGruver said Meader and the other volunteers at Freedom Hill \"have gone above and beyond to prepare the horses for student visits.\"\nFor more information on Freedom Hill Horse Rescue, go to www.fhhr.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The turnout, though, remained steady. Kids picked up supplies, played indoor games like cornhole and enjoyed free snow cones.\nCarly Palmer, For All Seasons' outreach coordinator, said 800 backpacks were prepared for the event with help from the Talbot County Department of Social Services.\nThose that weren't given away Wednesday will be delivered to local schools, Palmer said.\nShe added that the resource fair helps equip families with a stock of supplies even if they already went school shopping earlier in the summer.\n\"At the start of the school year, you may have some school supplies,\" she said. \"But they need that care throughout the year as well. This is just to really get them started.\"\nOver 25 community organizations and partners set up tables inside Easton Middle's gymnasium to give out free supplies and resources. The Talbot County Free Library brought more than 400 cartons of colored pencils, while Eastpoint Church provided kids with drawstring bags filled with notebooks, markers and more.\nFor All Seasons CEO Beth Anne Dorman said the supply giveaway checks one thing off the list that can often make parents stress in the build-up to school. And it makes students more confident walking in on day one, she said.\n\"The child can walk in knowing that it's one thing that they're prepared for,\" Dorman said.\nIn addition to supplies, Dorman said For All Seasons assists children who are experiencing stress due to school starting up. This time of year, the organization sees an uptick in mental health requests from students, Dorman said.\n\"The transition is difficult, especially for kids who are new to a school or kids who are transitioning into one school or another,\" she said.\nEspecially for low-income children, the supply giveaway is a chance to build community, Dorman and Palmer both said.\n\"Children who don't have maybe what other kids have understand they're not alone,\" Dorman said.\n\"Folks identify it as a safe space,\" she said of the event. \"That's the beautiful thing about not only what we're doing with the school supplies, but having all of our partners in the community together.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Talbot County Public Schools Director of Operations Kevin Shafer updated the Board of Education on the project at a work session on Monday.\n\"We did squeeze a lot of work into a very small amount of time, which was a bit risky,\" Shafer said. \"But the team has pulled it together, and things look fairly good.\"\nAs crews worked inside and around the building, teacher and staff moved in for the school year earlier this week.\n\"Staff returned today and it was very smooth according to (Principal Kari) Clow,\" Shafer said Monday.\nThe renovation is a multimillion-dollar effort that includes around $27 million in county funding as well as state funds from Maryland's Interagency Commission on School Construction. Construction is led by the Whiting-Turner Contracting Company.\nThe project is fully renovating the existing building, adding around 16,000 square feet. The Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers site located in the building was redone as part of phase one. Construction is expected to finish in 2026.\nChapel District Elementary is one of five elementary schools in the district. It was built in 1952 and last renovated in 1994.\nShafer acknowledged a few concessions had to be made in order for the school to welcome students back in time. Some hallway flooring hasn't been replaced, but he said it will still be safe in the meantime.\nThe school's gym won't be ready on the first day, either. It should reopen by the end of September, Shafer said. For now, PE will be held outside or in select classrooms.\nFurniture for the first two phases arrived on time, Shafer said. The district had to rework its furniture plan, placing orders this spring before tariffs took effect and drove up prices, Shafer told board members at previous meetings.\nFurniture for the third phase was ordered at the same time and is being kept in warehouses by the supplier at no cost to the district, Shafer said.\nDrivers passing the elementary school on Cordova Road will likely see significant construction work obstructing the front of the building. That's the third phase of construction, which includes renovations to the administrative offices and some classrooms. A new media center is also being added to the school.\nA temporary front office is located at the back of the building where the Critchlow Adkins Children's Center is located, according to a recent school newsletter. Parking will remain limited during construction.\n\"By the time students come next week, everything should be in good order,\" Shafer said on Monday.\nOn Thursday, Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi shouted out Chapel District Elementary administrators, teachers and staff.\n\"They are going to be teaching through the sounds of loud noises, construction, dust,\" Pepukayi said. \"They packed up their rooms at the end of the year. They just unpacked their rooms this year. And they are still managing to assemble classrooms to be ready for our students to walk through the door on Monday.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The group requested funding to launch a Violence Prevention Initiative course within the school system for students, parents, guardians, teachers and staff.\n\"For this to be successful in our community, or in any community, it has to be a multi-tiered approach because you can't teach one sector without teaching the other when they're all working together,\" Redmer said at the meeting.\nRedmer said the pilot program hosted at North Dorchester High School garnered great student feedback. School officials, Redmer and Whitelock are prepared to start the courses in September but are currently being held back by financial constraints.\nThis comes at a time when Dorchester County Public Schools are already struggling financially, having dealt with a $10.19 million deficit in January that forced the county to make hard decisions like cutting after-school and summer programs.\n\"We are in the process of searching for more funders to assist with this program,\" Thompson wrote. \"We are looking for multiple funding streams, including grants, philanthropists and other organizations.\"\nWhitelock said private investors and foundations can make tax-deductible donations through Redmer's nonprofit, Someone to Walk With.\nWhitelock, who wrote a book on violence prevention last year, said they will begin the courses in Dorchester County starting in September regardless of their fiscal status.\nCurrently, the program focuses on Cambridge-South Dorchester High School and Mace's Lane Middle School, where the majority of the suspensions from the previous year came from.\nThe goals of the program are to reduce youth violence and behavioral disruptions; to strengthen communication, problem solving and conflict resolution; and to build collaboration among schools, communities and corrections.\n\"One of the biggest concepts of the book is that violence is just a way people communicate,\" Whitelock said.\nFor Whitelock, prevention-focused education and training, rather than response-oriented approaches, are necessary. He said it is important that the burden is not all on the students.\n\"We want parents to go through the course as well, because we want you to know what we're teaching your kids, and we want you to be involved and helping to emphasize positive habits and positive reinforcement,\" Whitelock said.\nWhitelock, Thompson and Redmer want the initiative to extend outside of the schools as well, emphasizing the importance of a community approach. Redmer described this as \"the termite takeover\" approach: slow but effective.\n\"Cambridge faces some of the same issues found in larger metropolitan areas that impact the school setting,\" Thompson wrote. \"That is why this must be a collective effort involving the entire community to help reduce the violence that affects our schools.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That means that the 2025 MCAP test scores, scheduled for release on Tuesday, are likely to reflect a mix of old decisions and new strategies but will not fully reflect the bold policies now on paper.\nThe central question is: Has our state done enough to expect dramatic improvement? Unfortunately, our answer is no.\nIn 2023, the state Board of Education took an important step forward by adopting a reading resolution and recruiting Carey Wright as state superintendent. Wright has worked with urgency to establish the frameworks and infrastructure needed for real change: creating a pre-K–3 Literacy Policy, revising standards, launching a process to update assessments and, most critically, building a statewide coaching model to help teachers transform instruction in line with the science of reading.\nBut policies without resources do not change outcomes.\nSince taking office less than two years ago, Wright has secured:\n$40 million over five years from the U.S. Department of Education$6.8 million from the IBIS Group for Science of Reading trainingOver $3 million in private funding for a statewide literacy coaching program\nThat is nearly $50 million in federal and private funds — a lifeline for Maryland's reading agenda. But these investments are time-limited and unsustainable. We need to sustain this early investment with a permanent dedicated state commitment.\nImplementation of the Pre-K Literacy Policy is beginning with clear expectations for how local education agencies should deliver literacy instruction and steps they must take to help struggling children. Teachers now have access to no cost training in the Science of Reading. But coaching is a necessary component to help teachers apply what they have learned so that our children receive the maximum benefits of their reading instruction.\nIf we want the kind of results Mississippi achieved, we need the kind of investments Mississippi made. When Wright led the Mississippi Department of Education, the legislature passed the Literacy-Based Promotion Act, which dedicated roughly $15 million annually — just 0.2% of the state's budget — to literacy coaching and support. That investment powered Mississippi's dramatic gains.\nBy contrast, in Maryland, Wright asked the General Assembly to fund a statewide coaching program. The Excellence in Schools Act authorized a school leadership training program that included \"a research-based model for coaching school leaders and 25 instructional coaches.\" Yet the Legislature appropriated zero dollars for implementation.\nMeanwhile, the only state program we can identify that directly supports reading — the funds for Targeted Support and Improvement — is expiring.\nThe message is clear: Maryland cannot coach its way out of this crisis on outside dollars. Federal and philanthropic grants cannot replace state commitment.\nIf Maryland is serious about a reading comeback, the state must do more than hire the right superintendent. Our legislature must invest real, sustained resources in literacy — just as Mississippi did.\nIt's time for the Maryland legislature to step up and fund a reading agenda worthy of our children's potential. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — Students at the Talbot County's eight public schools returned to classrooms Monday, getting an earlier start compared to other districts that begin after the Labor Day weekend.In St. Michaels, a crossing guard stood on S. Talbot Street, directing drivers toward the St. Michaels Elementary School entrance. Car drop-off was relatively smooth, and all the buses arrived on time.\nSt. Michaels Elementary Principal Indra Bullock greeted families at the car drop-off starting at 7:30 a.m., while teachers showed kids the way to the front door. Some students walked in with smiles, while others were emotional for the first day.\nDan Schwartz dropped off his two kids, Henry and Eddie. Henry started kindergarten Monday, and Eddie started pre-K at the Critchlow Adkins Children's Center facility within the school building. The boys were excited for the upcoming school year, Schwartz said.\n\"I think they're just excited to meet new friends and get to know their teachers and the new school,\" Schwartz said. \"Eddie's excited to play, and Henry's just excited to learn.\"\nSchwartz, from Royal Oak, said his kids previously went to daycare in Cambridge. He's looking forward to their start at a new school.\n\"It's been a bit more of a schlep,\" he said of the commute to Cambridge. \"Now they're just excited to be going to school close to home.\"\n\"We're really, really happy to be in this school district,\" Schwartz added. \"We're excited, and have a lot of friends who had their kids in St. Michaels schools and have had a really good experience.\"\nON THE HORIZON\nTalbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said on Monday that the district's cell phone pouch policy will be implemented in the fall for St. Michaels Middle School students. The policy requires students to lock their phones in pouches during the school day in hopes that academic achievement and student engagement will both rise.\nThe pouch program was piloted last year at Easton Middle School. \"So far, so good,\" Pepukayi said of Easton Middle's cell phone rules.\nSt. Michaels Middle will begin to roll out expectations for the cell phone pouch policy before implementation around October, Pepukayi said.\nMeanwhile, teachers across the district will have a new policy to adhere to later this year: emergency lanyards. The lanyards will have buttons for staff to request help to their precise location during an emergency.\nThe superintendent said the lanyards, from the company Centegix, will also be a \"slow roll out.\"\n\"It's just one more layer, not just for students, but also staff,\" Pepukayi said earlier this summer. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "State test scores: Mid-Shore school districts see mixed results\n\n August 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Maryland Department of Education released English and math test scores Aug. 26, revealing a major jump for one Mid-Shore school district and mixed results for others.Test results from the 2024-2025 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program, or MCAP, show that statewide, students made slight gains in both subjects. English proficiency is at 50.8%, up from 48.4% the previous year. Math proficiency is at 26.5%, up from 24.1% last year.\nThe Mid-Shore's five counties — Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot — didn't always follow those state trends.\nIn English, Dorchester County outpaced all other counties in year-to-year gains. Dorchester's English proficiency saw the largest increase statewide — up 7.6% to a 41.3% proficiency rate, which ranks Dorchester 19th of 24 districts.\nDorchester Superintendent Jymil Thompson said in a press release that the improvement is a sign the district's work to climb the state rankings is paying off.\n\"These results show that belief leads to action — and action leads to results,\" Thompson said. \" ... Today, we can proudly say Dorchester is on the rise.\"\nCaroline tied for the fifth highest year-to-year improvement in English proficiency at 3.5%. The district's new English proficiency rate of 49% now ranks it 14th in the state.\nMeanwhile, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties were three of only four districts in Maryland with lower English proficiency rates than last year.\nQueen Anne's is still above the state average at 57% proficient, ranking ninth despite a 1.5% drop. Kent dropped 0.5% to 40.7% proficiency, ranking the district 20th statewide.\nTalbot is 16th in the state with a 45.4% proficiency rate after a 1.9% year-to-year decrease, the largest decrease in the state. In a statement, Talbot County Public Schools Director of Communications Debbie Gardner said the district is in the process of analyzing MCAP data and will make a presentation to the Board of Education in September.\nPROGRESS IN MATH\nAll 23 counties and Baltimore City are seeing progress in math. No district decreased in its math score from 2023-2024, and over a quarter of Maryland students are proficient in the subject.\nDorchester, again, saw the biggest hike of the Mid-Shore counties at 4.1%. The county is still just 20th statewide at 16.4% proficient. Kent follows at 21st with a 16.3% rate, up 3.7% from last year.\nKent County Superintendent Mary Boswell-McComas said in a statement that the district has worked on professionally developing school principals in math.\n\"We're seeing the payoff in how our principals coached teachers in developing students' mathematical reasoning and how our teachers incorporated that in their classrooms,\" the statement read.\nQueen Anne's remains the Mid-Shore county most proficient in math at 31.6%, a 2.9% hike from one year ago. The district ranks eighth in the state.\nCaroline jumped 2.5% to hit 22.2% proficiency, which ranks the district 15th.\nCaroline Superintendent Derek Simmons wrote in a statement that he's \"very encouraged\" to see the district's growth rate outpace the state's.\n\"Our sustained focus on what matters, and consistency around evidence-based approaches will continue our growth,\" Simmons wrote.\nTalbot math proficiency remained almost even, going up 0.6% to 18.9% this year. The district ranks 18th in proficiency. Only two other districts had year-to-year changes worse than Talbot.\nUP AND DOWN IN SCIENCE\nProficiency rates from the fifth and eighth grade science tests show Queen Anne's schools are well above the rest of the five Mid-Shore counties. In fifth grade, Queen Anne's is 10th of 24 districts with 29.3% proficiency, according to data on the Maryland Report Card.\nBut Talbot saw the state's second-highest yearly increase, climbing 5.9% to 22.8% and 15th overall.\nKent comes in at 16th in fifth grade science at 20.9%. Caroline is 18th with 19% and Dorchester is 20th with 17.4%.\nIn eighth grade science, Queen Anne's lost its first-place ranking from last year as other districts made significant jumps. But the county is still third in the state at 44.3%, down slightly from last year.\nCaroline's eighth graders were 16th in the state at 23.8%, a 4.5% jump. Dorchester increased by 4.6% to 19.9% proficiency, landing it at 18th.\nTalbot tied with Queen Anne's for the worst year-to-year change at -0.8%. It is ranked 19th now with 19.3% of eighth graders proficient on the science test.\nKent comes in at 16.8% proficiency, up from 13.4% last year.ENGLISH SCORES \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Students carry locked pouches during the entire school day, with their phones inside and not accessible.\nEach student has their own pouch, which travels with them daily from home to school. Phones are locked into the pouches at the beginning of the school day and unlocked at the end using a magnetic device. If a student leaves the pouch at home, they put their phone in the school office for the day.\nAccording to CCPS, year one of the pilot program was a success.\n\"We saw it was a good first year with it,\" said Caroline County Superintendent Derek Simmons.\n\"The recommendation ... the board accepted was to give it another year at our middle schools. One year does not mean a trend. We saw good good results, but we want to track it for another year before we make any determinations about if we were to move it forward to the high school level.\"\nThe cellphone pouches were created by the company Yondr and were tested in both Caroline County middle schools last school year.\nDuring the June Caroline County Board of Education meeting, district staff presented statistics for the school year. Compared to the year prior, CCPS saw 30.6% fewer referrals last school year, with 130 fewer attacks, threats or fights and about 200 fewer instances of disrespect and disruptions.\nAccording to Simmons, student and parents have been receptive of the cellphone pouches.\n\"Last year it was minimal resistance,\" Simmons said. \"You bring in something new, people are going to have some concern. They ask questions, administrators at the building level handle the questions really well. By and large, everything went well with compliance. It's funny, we've had hardly any asks this year going in the middle because it just has become the expectation.\"\nAfter one more school year at the middle school level, CCPS will revisit the topic and potentially incorporate the cellphone pouches to the high school level. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester schools climb in state rankings after first year of ambitious reform plan\n\n August 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 509\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last year, Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson set out on a mission to change the school district's current ranking of 23rd out of 24 in the overall Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program evaluations. A year later, the results are in, and they look promising.The \"23, no more\" initiative is a three-year plan to move DCPS from the 23rd spot to 15th. Testing data released by the state this week shows the county has successfully moved up two spots overall, and it improved from 23rd to 19th in English Learning Arts proficiency.\nWhile DCPS' climb in the rankings may not be massive, district leaders say it shows notable progress.\n\"So we looked at the numbers as to what it would take for us to get to the middle of the pack, and we said, 'Okay, 15. If we move this amount of kids every year, we can at least get to 15. And then if we go higher than 15, that will be just added bonus,'\" Thompson said.\nThe superintendent said key strategies to get to 15 include setting a clear vision, conducting quarterly walkthroughs, focusing on instruction, rallying the team around a goal, supporting teachers, differentiating learning, simplifying processes and putting structures and systems in place.\nThe district's strategic plan, called \"Believe in Us,\" guides these efforts and emphasizes core values such as joy, putting children first and accountability. This plan has four key priorities: advance academics, optimize operations, pursue partnerships and cultivate conversations.\nFor Thompson, it is crucial that the community outside of the school system is involved in this process for it to work.\n\"I think that education is a community issue because I don't think there will be one person that would say that they don't want kids to be educated,\" Thompson said. \"That's the emphasis, that's the nucleus, right there. Everyone wants kids to be educated, so it's everyone's responsibility to ensure that the kids are being educated, not just the school system.\"\nThompson hopes the school system can act as a catalyst for countywide transformation through incremental progress and innovation.\nEfforts are underway to recruit more certified teachers and administrators to improve the attractiveness of Dorchester County Public Schools to parents and families in the area.\nThough these early results are promising, Thompson knows there will still be challenges to accomplish his ambitious goal. He said these do not deter him. \"There's no challenges that I don't think we can overcome as a district and community working collectively together that can be a hindrance for us to move to 15,\" he said.\nAs long as community members are willing to come up with creative solutions, Thompson firmly believes that there is no challenge they won't be able to overcome.\n\"We're not turning anybody away and we want everyone to be involved in the process because I think at the end of the three year journey, I think people will be happy about our progress as a school system,\" Thompson said. \"But I don't want them to be happy as innocent bystanders. I want them to be happy as active participants in the process.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Through these partnerships, the Judy Centers are able to provide a full range of early intervention and comprehensive services within the school and center.\"\nThe center offers multiple avenues of help and learning for Federalsburg residents ages 5 and younger.\n\"When we talk about working with those families and children, we offer play groups and our services always have a parent and a child component,\" said Heather Harding, Federalsburg Judy Center Early Learning Hub coordinator. \"It's always a family caregiver and the child together. So we offer play groups throughout the week, we offer family engagements, we offer parent training and that may take on different forms… We service the whole family so it's whatever the family determines their needs are, and it is a strength-based program.\"\nThe celebration of 25 years featured an event with activities for children and families. The Judy Center created a timeline walkthrough for the last 25 years and invited all previous employees from the 25 years to participate.\n\"It was really important for us that when we plan the celebration that we took it back to the focus of the Judy Center work, which is family,\" Elizabeth Saylor, supervisor of instruction, said.\n\"So, we did a big family event, so the kids had something fun to do, and the families had something fun to do, and then we did all those the traditional ceremonial things too…We invited all previous employees to come back as well. So, it truly was as current families, family families, but then definitely our work family as well.\"\nStaff said the impact was the best reward for all the hard work.\n\"I absolutely love my job with the Judy Center, and I was here previously, when we also worked as an Early Head Start under the direction of Ms. Tearesa French,\" Harding said. \"She was the supervisor for 22 years of it. The impact that the work has made on everyone, it was never just one person. It's always been a collective. It's always been at the helm of Caroline County Public Schools, and just all the things that we were able to do to serve children and families has just been wonderful.\"\nTo learn more about the Judy Center, visit carolineschools.org/page/early-learning. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

FY27 shows the county allocating about $1.4 million, FY28 shows $8.1 million and FY29 shows $15.5 million.\nThese numbers are large, but Caroline County Public Schools Superintendent Derek Simmons said he expects the county allocation to be lowered over time because of state funding.\nSimmons said the numbers shown on the capital improvement plan for county allocations were determined based on what was needed to cover projected costs above what the state had allocated to the project.\nThe state and the county will then go back and forth on what the county actually needs based on research of student population and other factors. Simmons said the hope is that through this process, they will be able to get the county allocation amount down.\n\"We will spend the next several months, possibly a year, going back and forth justifying our ask and then them hopefully changing their stance and meeting somewhere in the middle,\" Simmons said. \"But what this represents is anything that we ask for above what the state is saying we need, it becomes 100% local cost.\"\nThe Board of Education approved the capital improvement program Sept. 2. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Over in the \"car riders\" lane, the parents are assured the kids will have a great day.This all seems familiar, doesn't it? No matter how old your children, grandchildren, great grandchildren or other children may be, this scenario has occurred for decades.\nWatching the children in their new school attire, including new shoes, reminds me of my young elementary school days back in Bishopville. On the first day of school, we were waiting for the bus quite uncomfortable in new clothes with the tags freshly cut off. Posture was not a problem — store starch was even worse than Mom's cooked starch. Y'all remember that Argo starch mess.\nIn a future column, I will include \"them new stiff school shoes.\"\nNow, to the lunch boxes. Breakfast was very important on a school morning because the next meal seemed to be \"hours\" away if you had nothing for breakfast. On a winter morning, there was always a freshly cooked pot of oatmeal or cream of wheat.\nIf we got up early enough, there could be scrambled eggs, and scrapple or sausage, and/or toast. Suddenly the yell came — \"Bus is coming.\" We grabbed the lunch boxes and out the door we flew.\nWe all had the same packed lunch so you could not grab the wrong one.\nThen came the '60s with those special lunch boxes — Roy Rogers, Lone Ranger, Hop-Along-Cassidy, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland and many more. My late younger brother would tell you the boxes were made from metal and tin — because I would hit him with mine, so he really did know.\nA great occurrence has happened with school lunches — most counties have free school lunches for all students regardless of income. This was long overdue, as buying lunch foods to pack is expensive.\nHowever, many of us have that child or grandchild who insists on a packed lunch. Let us explore foods that are convenient and not very expensive to purchase.\nWalking through the grocery store, I see such a variety of foods that kids love. Let's go back to the '50s lunch box and see what we find — a sour pickle wrapped in foil, chunks of sharp cheddar cheese, several crackers — white or Ritz, a bologna and cheese sandwich, leftover chicken wings or legs from supper the night before, or the popular peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\nThen comes my children going to school in the 1970s and 1980s. School cafeterias had changed greatly by this time. In middle school, there was a jukebox, round tables as well as the long style, and a \"huge\" change in school food. Some lunches were spaghetti with meatballs, garlic bread and a salad. There were submarines with small bags of chips, and the ever popular \"a la carte\" foods. You could purchase candy bars, ice cream, individual sandwiches and add a bowl of soup. Lunch boxes turned into lunch bags or insulated bags. The change was good — and the staff size grew immensely.\nAt this point, I need to say \"hat's off\" to the food staff in every school district in every state. Your jobs are very necessary to help the school day be enjoyable for everyone.\nPacked lunches in the '80s and '90s included foods like beef jerky, cheese sticks, hot chips and pop-top cans of soups. Lunch had very few sandwiches, as students would buy lunch on \"pizza days\" and \"taco days.\"\nSchools started serving breakfast, lunch and afternoon snacks. What a wonderful addition to our school systems for our most precious and valuable assets to our country.\nNow, we are exploring school lunches from 2000 to 2025. There seems to have been a rise in allergens such as peanuts, gluten and dairy in 2025 that makes it more difficult to get a big variety of food on the menus. Most schools are now offering two or three different lunch choices and that ever so popular a la carte menu.\nAs I close this column today, I realize going back in time brings back so many memories of my school years. Some mornings are calm; others feel like a race against the clock. On the busiest days, a few shortcuts keep me sane. I keep a \"lunchbox basket\" in the pantry filled with pre-portioned snacks like trail mix, whole grain crackers, or fruit leather, so I can grab and pack without digging. In the fridge, washed and sliced produce goes into small containers or bento compartments right after grocery shopping, so it's ready to drop into the lunchbox.\nA community park is now in the spot where Bishopville Elementary School once stood. The playground area is still there, thankfully. As I look at where the school once stood, I am flooded with memories. No matter what type of lunch bag or box you carried. No matter what kind of biscuit or bread you used and no matter what kind of filling was on that sandwich — we were all the same children from a small town.\nLet's see what is on the menu for packed lunch. Here are a few recipes from my back-to-school column last year.\nBBQ CHICKEN CUPS\n1 roll of Pillsbury Grands biscuits (usually the Southern style works best but you can use any flavor your child likes), 3 lbs chicken breast, 1 cup chicken broth, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, barbecue sauce.\nPlace chicken breasts in the bottom of the crockpot. Pour chicken broth and seasonings over chicken. Cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3-4 hours. Remove chicken from the crockpot and shred with two forks. Mix with your favorite barbecue or hot sauce. Bake the biscuits according to directions, then immediately when they are done tear a biscuit in half and flatten it, place it into a muffin tin, top with chicken and shredded cheese, and bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes.\nPB&J APPLES\n2 apples, 1/4 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup jelly.\nSlice apples into ¼-inch rounds. Use a small cookie cutter to cut the core from the center of each slice. Spread peanut butter on jelly on half of the slices then cover with the remaining halves. This is one that you'll want to make in the morning so the apples don't brown overnight.\nPB&J SUSHI\n4 slices white bread, 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter, 1/2 cup grape jelly.\nRemove crusts from bread. Using a rolling pin, roll bread until very flat. Spread with peanut butter and jelly and roll tightly. Cut into 2-inch pieces and serve.\nPICKLE ROLL UPS\n4 slices of your child's favorite lunch meat, mustard or mayo, cheese, pickle wedge.\nSpread mustard or mayo on the slices of meat, layer some cheese then another layer of meat. Roll a pickle wedge up and pack tight. You can use any variety of meat, cheese or condiments in this dish.\nTURKEY CLUB ROLL UPS\n4 slices deli turkey, 2 tsp mayo, 2 slices cheddar (halved or quartered), 1/2 cup shredded or chopped lettuce, 1/2 tomato (sliced), 1/4 red onion (thinly sliced), 1/2 avocado (sliced), 4 slices cooked bacon, kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper.\nOn a clean work surface, place two slices of deli turkey and spread a thin layer of mayo on top. Top with 1 slice cheddar, half of the lettuce, tomato, red onion and avocado, and 2 slices bacon. Season generously with salt and pepper. Roll up and secure with a toothpick, then repeat with remaining ingredients.\nGRILLED CHEESE ROLL UPS\n8 thick slices of soft white bread, 1.5 cups finely grated cheddar, 2 tbsp melted butter.\nOne by one, slice the crusts off of each slice of bread, then use a rolling pin to flatten. Add a pinch of cheese to each slice, making sure you leave a small strip at the end to brush with butter. Tightly but carefully roll up each slice to the end, brush with butter, then roll shut and place seam-side-down. Brush all over with butter. Add roll ups to a dry pan seam-side-down over low-medium heat and fry until golden all over with the cheese starting to leak out. Use your tongs to frequently turn them. You may need to do this in two batches depending on the size of your pan.\nNUTELLA BANANA SUSHI\nThis recipe is by the single serving, so repeat as many times as you need.\nNutella, 1 banana, 1 whole wheat wrap.\nLay your wrap on a breadboard and slather with Nutella, Place the banana on top of your chocolate coating, Roll the wrap as you would sushi or a burrito and carefully slice into rolls. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gen Z’s lessons on Sept. 11: A generation raised in its shadow calls for deeper lessons\n\n September 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ADDISON NOGAR | Section: News \n \n 518\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Addison Nogar is a junior at Kent Island High School and contributing writer this semester.In high school today, Sept. 11 is not often taught in detail. Some history teachers mention it briefly, but rarely explore the full impact.\nGrowing up in the shadow of Sept. 11, piecing together fragmented narratives from stories, documentaries and secondhand accounts, I never fully grasped the enormity of that day until I stood at the 9/11 Memorial — a member of the generation that inherited its aftermath.\nMy first realization of the tragedy came while eating dinner in 2013. My mom turned on the movie World Trade Center. The graphic image of a man dying under debris was the first thing I saw. I watched the entire film but never again. For years, I looked for it to come on again, but the only outlets covering Sept. 11 were news sources. After that, every year I hoped to learn and hear more stories and perspectives from that day.\nThe one lesson that stayed with me came from my fifth grade teacher. Most people aren't aware of the story of the Red Bandana Man. I wasn't either until she played a video. Welles Crowther, a 24-year-old volunteer firefighter, lost his life that day. He had played lacrosse at Boston College while studying economics, later finding a job in the South Tower of the World Trade Center.\nHe wore a red bandana under his helmet while playing lacrosse, a gift from his father when he was younger. Crowther saved more than 18 lives on the seventh floor, carrying injured people down the stairs. He covered their faces with the red bandana to help them breathe through the smoke.\nCrowther made one more trip into the building before it collapsed. He never made it back out. Today he is remembered as the Red Bandana Man — a symbol of courage, compassion and selflessness. Thank you to my fifth grade teacher for sharing his inspiring and heroic act.\nOn April 22, 2023, I visited the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. Reflecting on the names etched on the wall and the site where the twin structures once stood, it was surreal to grasp the transformation over the past two decades.\nI took a 90-minute tour of the museum and memorial. The indoor and outdoor experience examined what happened on Sept. 11, explored the history and rebuilding of the site, and highlighted the stories of those affected by the attacks.\nThe most memorable part was the Survivor Tree — a Callery pear tree that survived the attacks. Severely damaged, it was discovered at ground zero and later removed by the New York City Department. After recovery, the tree returned to the memorial in 2010. New smooth limbs grew from the stumps, showing the connection between the tree's past and present. It now stands as a living reminder of resilience, survival and rebirth.\nSept. 11 deserves our deepest respect and appreciation. Now that we're old enough to grasp the tragedy more fully, it's fitting for teachers to dedicate time to discuss it — sharing narratives from that day and honoring the moment of silence it has earned. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Peter & Paul and The Gunston School in the small division.\nStudents from Easton and St. Michaels claimed victory in the hard-fought matches, tackling questions on the amendments, Congress, government-related vocabulary and more.\nIn a close race in the small division, St. Michaels erased a 10-point deficit by correctly answering the last prompt of the contest: a question on the 20th Amendment, also known as the Lame Duck Amendment, which moved term start dates for the president, vice president and members of Congress up to January.\n\"We just wanted to represent our school, prove that we were the best,\" senior Sebastian Cornish said.\nThe four St. Michaels students attributed their victory to James Kunz, their former AP Government teacher. They said taking his AP class two years ago prepared them for the competition. Some last-minute practice during lunch this year helped, too.\n\"He let us know about it briefly last year, and it came up again at the beginning of the school year, and we were like, 'We're all still down to do it,'\" senior Tyler Murphy said.\nKunz and other teachers, along with family and friends, watched from the crowd in what became an especially competitive environment inside the library's side room.\nStudents hovered their hands over the answer bell as questions were read aloud in a race to acquire as many points as possible. Wrong answers resulted in deductions.\nEaston High School's Constitution Bowl team took down North Caroline High School in Saturday's first match. By scoring the most points across both divisions, Easton High secured the grand prize, which included a plaque and a copy of the U.S. Constitution. Easton's four members signed the Constitution and will take it back to their school.\nThe event was hosted by the Mid-Shore Constitution Alliance — led by Richard Holman, Michelle Ewing and Julie Quick — in conjunction with the Colonel Tench Tilghman Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution. It capped off a string of events held during Constitution Week from Sept. 14 to 20.\nAfter the competition concluded, Wes Hagood, president of the Tench Tilghman chapter, thanked the students and families for attending.\n\"Participation today by all of our competitors really restores my faith in the youth of America,\" Hagood said.\nMembers of the winning St. Michaels team said they encourage younger students to participate in the future or learn more about the Constitution itself.\n\"Even if they don't really know about it, I'd encourage them to come watch,\" senior Brody McDaniel said. \"It teaches them a lot about government and the Constitution.\"\nMid-Shore U.S. Constitution Scholastic Competition results:\nLarge Division:\nFirst place, 415 points: Easton High School (Paige Bodle, Kadence McGuckin, Elmer Pineda and Lorelai Yacks).Second place, 350 points: North Caroline High School (Nicholas Jastram, Amanda Porter and Della Sefton).\nSmall Division:\nFirst place, 265 points: St. Michaels High School (Bo Asmussen, Sebastian Cornish, Tyler Murphy, Brody McDaniel).Second place, 250 points: Sts. Peter & Paul High School (William Coughlan, Tara Foley and William Murphy).Third place, 140 points: The Gunston School (Marley Farmer, Teddy Verger and Ben Watkins). \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Parents and teachers clapped loudly when their kids scored and jeered at some bang-bang, judgment calls by the competition hosts, who maintained a fair and balanced scoring system.\nThe specific, quick-hitting questions gave students a shot to display their impressive memory of the U.S. Constitution and show some quick reflexes when attempting to ring in before their opponents.\nIn the end, teams from Easton High School and St. Michaels High School won in their respective divisions. But the real winners were the hosts of the event, which capped off Constitution and Citizenship Week (Sept. 14 to 20).\n\"Participation today by all of our competitors really restores my faith in the youth of America,\" said Wes Hagood, a judge and president of the local Sons of the American Revolution chapter.\nTo learn more about the Constitution Bowl, read my story below.\n— Konner Metz \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

a pre-K program plan that is not feasible without Maryland Accreditation and EXCELS Level 4 status; financial assumptions that lack contingency planning for enrollment shortfalls, grant delays, or facility overruns; limited and underdeveloped plans for serving students with disabilities, English learners, and other student groups and an instructional program that remains underdeveloped and not adequately aligned with Maryland College and Career Ready Standards.\nThe committee acknowledged the charter school's group enthusiasm for the classical charter model, timely responsiveness in communication, and a strong commitment to the idea of school choice, Bell said.\n\"But the team also noted authorizing a charter school is not simply about approving an idea, it's about assuming full responsibility for students, staff, and the community under our umbrella,\" Bell said, a level of responsibility that requires readiness, compliance, and sustainability, \"none of which were determined to be sufficiently demonstrated within their application.\"\nFollowing the turbulent meeting Sept. 3 filled with heated discussions in the face of the application's proposed denial, the Queen Anne's County Classical Charter School group returned to the Board Sept 10. to present answer questions and allow for an in depth application review for the Board's decision.\nLead by a Board of Directors with expertise of former teachers and education professionals, the motivation to establish the classical charter school arose to provide options to parents and enhance the current system upon seeing current dropping proficiency rates, founder Audrey Scott said.\nCharter Committee Board of Directors President Ashley MacLeay noted that although seeking autonomy through waivers, the proposed classical charter school would ultimately be a public school part of the QACPS system that the Board of Education would oversee.\nStudent enrollment would be based on a lottery system.\nThe charter committee claimed it was not afforded opportunities for collaboration and was provided little assistance in certain application aspects, like identifying facilities.\nIf approved by the Board of Education, the charter school would continually seek collaboration with QACPS in establishing a charter agreement, as \"one holistic school system,\" she said.\nTo start, the charter school would need six teachers and has already received far more resumes than that of interested teachers, Scott said.\nThe group claimed interest has been overwhelmingly positive from the community including partners like the Giving the Edge Foundation and letters of support from the Queen Anne's County Commissioners.\nWhile not initiated yet, the committee received support from the county to direct mail to every county home to serve as a first general introduction to parents, Scott said.\nWhile letters of support have been received from the community overall, the QACPS Board of Education questioned student sustainability and a \"demonstration of need\" and claimed a lack of parent voices interested in enrolling students.\nCharter committee officials stated they have personally spoken to multiple families in full support of the program, just without time to write letters of support or a hesitancy to speak up at Board meetings.\nWith a potential program so monumental looming for the county, Board of Education member Mathew Drayer questioned how parents couldn't find the time to voice their support.\nA broad petition of county residents as well as outside of the county collected \"well over two hundred signatures,\" that included parents, MacLeay said.\nAlthough limited with polling data, the committee said it was happy to perform more surveys and was confident in the need.\nThe charter committee would ensure future marketing to all 8,000 students across the county's districts, Targeting families with elementary age children including homeschooled, the charter school would welcome reaching where families are, including libraries for an active presence and share what the potential school would entail, MacLeay said.\n\"We are trying to ensure we have viable schools with the right teachers and support and staff and everything they need to be successful,\" Board of Education President Shannon Bent said, and needed to hear from the community if there were additional needs to address.\nScott credited the above and beyond thoroughness forth by QACPS staff and Board of Education in reviewing the application.\n\"We are all in this for the children,\" Kibler said, and encouraged the committee to strengthen their application and resubmit next year.\nThe applicant retains the right to appeal to the Maryland State Board of Education or to resubmit during the next application window.\nThe QACPS Board of Education will next meet Oct 1. at 6 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County officials learn about Early Head Start cut\n\n September 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 401\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — On Tuesday, Charles Huester, executive director for Maryland Rural Development Cooperation, discussed Early Head Start funding cuts with the Caroline County Commissioners.MRDC, which runs the Early Head Start programs in Caroline and Cecil counties, announced on Aug. 27 that the Early Head Start program would be ending effective Sept. 2 after it did not receive funding from the Office of Head Start.\nThe free program supports pregnant women and young children's learning and development.\nHuester said they were surprised to hear the program did not receive the necessary funds given that that the MRDC hasn't officially heard back from Office of Head Start about its grant application. Huester said their competitors for the funding told them they didn't receive the grant.\n\"I'm not really sure the practice of Office of Head Start not replying to anyone. We found out through a third party, direct competitor for funding actually. Maryland Family Network let us know what was going on,\" Huester said.\nHuester explained the funding was cut because of a decision to apply as a direct recipient instead of a subrecipient.\n\"We have over $1 million in funding. We applied for $3 million in funding, so essentially what we learned is if we continued as a subrecipient with Maryland Family Network, we probably would have had funding, it would have been no issue, but because we chose to apply as a direct recipient, we didn't receive funding,\" Huester said.\nThe decision to apply independently was made by the organization's board, but Huester said if MRCD knew that applying as a direct recipient would impacted its funding, MRDC would've made a different choice.\nHuester said that MRDC reached out to Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st), who sent a letter to the Office of Head Start. Harris said he has not received a response.\nAddressing concerns from residents about the program's end, Huester said MRDC has explored options to provide for the toddlers of Caroline County.\nThe options include introducing a Patty Center model, which aims to help the family as a whole, allowing parents to come on site for services like resume building and job searching while their children are looked after. There is also fee structure option, which consist of exploring what residents could afford to pay to keep a center open at spaces in Greensboro and Federalsburg.\nHuester also discussed converting existing Head Start spots and a collaboration with the Maryland State Department of Education for classroom models. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot school board dives into test score trends\n\n September 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 695\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot school officials took a deeper look at state test scores last week, indicating upward trends in math and English for some grades and dips in others.At a work session on Sept. 15, Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, presented to Talbot Board of Education members breakdowns of 2024-2025 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program scores by grade and student group.\nThe presentation showed increases from the previous year in English proficiency for third and fourth grades, but drops for fifth and eighth grades. Math proficiency spiked year-to-year for fourth, sixth and seventh grades, but the number of students proficient algebra significantly fell.\nThe deeper dive came after the state released test score data for the 2024-2025 school year last month. While proficiency rates increased statewide, Talbot County students saw mixed results. English proficiency dropped to 45.4%, 16th in the state and the largest year-to-year decrease (1.9%) of all districts.\nIn math, 18.9% of students were proficient, 18th in the state and nearly even with the previous year's mark. Other counties, such as Dorchester, saw notable gains, rising spots in the statewide rankings.\nTwo days after the Sept. 15 work session, Talbot Board of Ed Member Deborah Bridges said at a monthly meeting that the district's results kept her up at night.\n\"After our work session on Monday night, I couldn't sleep,\" Bridges said. \"Our scores, it upset me so much. And I wondered, what are we missing? What is going on in our schools?\"\nBoard members largely agreed that the results aren't a matter of pointing fingers at teachers or staff. Instead, they are focused finding solutions to fix some of the problem areas.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said at the work session that she hopes school officials can begin to pinpoint some reasons behind the data trends.\n\"If I look at us, and we're going down, whereas a neighboring county who has a similar population of kids and they're going up, I want to know why,\" Jackson said.\nEinhorn said while the state tests are an \"important measure,\" it's one of many ways to assess academic achievement and growth.\n\"This is one assessment given at a single period of time, which does not always accurately reflect what students know and what they're able to do overall,\" Einhorn said.\nENGLISH\nFifth and tenth grades suffered the largest proficiency drops of 5.6% and 10%, respectively. But fourth grade proficiency rose to 50% in the most recent results. And while third grade proficiency dipped from last year's 47.9% mark, it's still at 43.6%, an improvement over a 35% rate two years ago.\n\"This really speaks to the work that this board has invested in early literacy, and starting to see that trend move up,\" Einhorn said at the work session.\nMeanwhile, most student groups followed the district's overall trend of slightly decreasing in English proficiency. Asian students fell from 68.9% to 51.2%, while Talbot's multilingual learners dropped from 8.7% to 5.1%.\nMATH\nOne of the sharpest drops came in Algebra II proficiency: 32.8% of students passed the state test in 2023-2024; only 7.1% passed in 2024-2025.\nEinhorn acknowledged that as an \"area of need.\" She noted that new math standards for K-8 will go into effect next school year. And in two years, the district will begin integrated algebra courses, infusing geometry concepts, she said.\nFourth grade rose nearly six percentage points to 32% proficiency this past year, while seventh grade had a similar hike from 11% to 17%.\nBy student group, one result stood out: Black students in the district remain under 5% proficient in math. Einhorn admitted the shortcoming.\n\"The less than 5% is indicating that we are still underserving our Black students and that we still need to continue looking at strategies that better prepare them to show what they know and are able to do in mathematics,\" Einhorn said.\nBoard Member Dyshekia Strawberry said she'd like to see the district work with community partners to specifically tackle the gap in math proficiency for Black students.\nBoard members thanked Einhorn for presenting the detailed trends, acknowledging that there's work to be done to get some of the numbers going in a positive direction.\n\"We have to do better, and we're open to hear how we're going to do that,\" Jackson said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Both are open to the public.\nThe civil case deals with whether a court, when asked by an unlicensed landlord, can require tenants to pay rent. The criminal case is centered on whether police officers can initiate traffic stops for suspicion of cell phone use \"when they observe a driver manipulating a mobile phone,\" according to the case's online summary.\nFor each case, lawyers on both sides will have 30 minutes each to make their oral arguments, which build off of their written briefs to the court.\nStudents from local high schools and Chesapeake College are expected to attend.\nMaryland Supreme Court Justice Brynja Booth, of the 1st Appellate Judicial Circuit encompassing the Eastern Shore, said the special hearings are a way for the public to become involved in the judicial process.\n\"I really do believe that it's critical for the public's confidence in the judiciary,\" Booth said inside her Washington Street office on Tuesday.\nBooth acknowledged a recent \"erosion of public confidence,\" something she hopes can be quelled by the Maryland Supreme Court's off-site trips to places outside its Annapolis building.\nChief Justice Matthew Fader and six other justices, including Booth, comprise the Supreme Court. Formerly the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court usually hears cases after accepting a petition from a party regarding the Appellate Court of Maryland's decisions.\nBooth noted the Supreme Court's trip to Easton as historically significant. From 1805 to 1851, the then-Court of Appeals sat in Annapolis and Easton, Booth wrote. The court hasn't sat in Easton since 1851, she said.\nOff-site oral arguments are a relatively new endeavor for Maryland's most prestigious court. They're made possible through an administrative order, Booth said, which facilitates hearings at educational locations across the state. Arguments have been heard in Prince George's, Baltimore, Montgomery and St. Mary's County, she said.\nBooth and other Supreme Court of Maryland officials worked with Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi and Assistant Superintendent Helga Einhorn to coordinate Friday's event.\nOn Tuesday, Booth said she'd love to see students get involved in the judicial field, especially given what she sees as a lack of attorneys on the Eastern Shore.\nBooth, a longtime Easton-based attorney, said the Eastern Shore is a \"wonderful place to practice law and raise a family.\" She hopes Friday's special hearings will encourage students not only to explore law, but consider the Eastern Shore as a place to do so.\n\"You can be a little fish in the big pond, or you can come back to the Shore,\" Booth said. \"You can be a big fish in a little pond.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Opinions from the court are expected at a later date.\nPepukayi said she think the cell phone case will resonate with students and members of the public who attended.\n\"I think the next time someone reaches for their cell phone while driving, if they were sitting in this room, they're gonna think twice,\" she said.\nYacks took interest in that case, in particular because the issue at hand of texting and driving was easily understandable. The professionalism and legal vocabulary used by attorneys on both sides of the case impressed her, she said.\nGoing in, Yacks said she knew the Maryland Supreme Court opening session at the high school was \"unprecedented.\" She left with a lot of useful insight as she considers pursuing a career in the law-adjacent political science field one day.\n\"It was awesome to see a similar example of what it might look like in the future,\" Yacks said.\nJustices give advice\nAfter the oral arguments concluded, students from Easton High, St. Michaels High, The Gunston School and Chesapeake College lined up behind two microphones to pick the brains of the seven justices on the Maryland Supreme Court for nearly an hour.\nQuestions ranged from asking about how Supreme Court hearings differed from trials, to how justices check their personal biases at the door, to what cases have stood out as the most interesting.\nJustices refrained from naming specific cases as their \"favorite,\" but Justice Stephen Gould said a worthwhile one is usually dependent on the attorneys involved.\n\"My favorite kind of a case is a case in which we have excellent lawyers before us,\" Gould said. \"Fortunately, because we get to pick our cases, for the most part, we virtually almost always get really, really good lawyers, and I think today was an example of that.\"\nGould emphasized that lawyers have their own styles and strategies, which were on display for students Friday. Each case had an attorney for the appellant, the side appealing a lower court's decision, and an attorney for the appellee, the side asking the Supreme Court to rule the opposing argument moot or back up the lower court's previous ruling.\nBut for all attorneys, Gould noted: \"They're prepared. They know their stuff.\"\nOne student asked the justices what common misconception they often encounter. Justice Angela Eaves said many don't realize that they aren't deciding cases based on personal feelings.\n\"We resolve based on the factual record and what the law says about it,\" Eaves said.\nThe justice for the 2nd Appellate Judicial Circuit (Baltimore and Harford counties) added that the court's job is more than just assessing the specific case before them.\n\"We're really looking at the broader implications of what the law should be with respect to the type of issues that come before us,\" Eaves said.\nJustices were asked to give advice to students that want to study law.\nChief Justice Matthew Fader emphasized that law isn't a narrow field, meaning people studying it should \"keep (their) learning broad.\" Attorneys are tasked with helping clients who come to them with real-life problems in a variety of areas, he added.\n\"Anything that happens in the world can end up in a piece of litigation,\" Fader said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The plan, required by the Interagency Committee on School Construction, aims to provide an effective learning environment, minimize disruptions, preserve school property value, maximize facility efficiency, and provide a foundation for risk management and preventive maintenance. The school system has 17 buildings, totaling nearly 960,000 square feet, valued at approximately $678 million. The construction cost per square foot for FY26 is $537, an 11.5% increase from last year. This increase is attributed to inflation and rising labor costs. Tariffs are a looming concern that may further impact costs. The board approved the maintenance plan.Robert Willoughby, director of administrative services, conducted the first reading of the Operation School Nutrition Programs Policy 9910. The policy is an update to a policy from the 1980s, changing the name from \"school lunch program\" to \"nutrition program\" to reflect the inclusion of breakfast. It also clarifies pricing for meals under the Community Eligibility Provision and for a la carte items.Willpoughny presented the first reading of Policy 55080 on service animals. The policy aims to comply with ADA regulations and defines a service animal as an animal trained to perform a task for a person with a disability. It explicitly states that emotional support animals and therapy animals are not service animals. By law, service animals are typically dogs, with miniature horses considered under very specific circumstances for mobility issues. The policy outlines considerations for miniature horses, compliance with the law and the development of regulations for implementation.Superintendent Derek Simmons presented the Citizens' Advisory Committee nominees for 2025-2027. The committee is made up of parents and community members who provide feedback to the board. The committee was approved by the board.Kirk Howie, director of student services, provided an unofficial September enrollment update. The current unofficial enrollment is 5608, down about 40 students from last year, which is within the average 3% transition rate for Maryland. Elementary enrollment saw an increase of 53 students, while middle schools had a reduction of 51 and high schools a reduction of 61. Home school/instruction enrollment has increased, with 537 students this year, up from 466 in 2022-2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

School nutrition specialist Kaitlin Fraer organized events at three different elementary schools in the county this October, which is National Farm to School Month. At the first station, guided by youth nutritionist specialist Beth Palumbo from the American Dairy Association, students learned about cows and fresh milk. Palumbo and her team were excited to share that milk — yes, even chocolate milk — can keep you hydrated after physical activities.\nChristine Allred, a former project leader and nutrition educator, and Deon Littles from the University of Maryland's College of Agriculture and Natural Resources showed the kids where their fruits and vegetables come from at the University of Maryland Extension station.\nAllred read a picture book called \"Up, Down, and Around\" and instructed the kids to stand up, sit down, and spin around as the seeds were planted.\nEach student received a plastic toy version of a fruit or vegetable to throw in the \"fruit salad\" — a colorful parachute that they raised in the air to mix the fruits and vegetables together.\nFarmers from Beagle Hill Farm, located near the elementary school, brought tractors to show the students while also teaching them about growing sweet potatoes.\nAdrian Hill and Greg Butterfield from Beagle Hill Farm assisted at the station.\n\"A lot of kids just don't have that connection of where their food comes from, or their clothing, or what agriculture can mean to them,\" said Butterfield, who has helped with the event for the last four years. \"Maybe we'll make the next generation of farmers because I feel like it is getting less and less every year.\"\nThe students were invited to plant sweet potatoes, pull fresh vegetables out of the dirt and use a planter to plant seeds.\nThe youngsters had a chance to meet farm animals, including horses, pigs, goats and bunnies.\nSt. Mary's Farm Bureau Ambassadors Susannah Wathen and Sam Wathen introduced the students to a horse named Willa, who the kids were intrigued to learn is blind in one eye.\nAfter moving through the stations, the students were served hamburgers and cheeseburgers with ground beef from Deere View Farm and Meats, Russell Bros LLC and Part Green Hill Farm.\n\"Living in a farming community, many people take advantage of the fact that they can get local produce most of the year, but it takes hard work to make that a reality,\" Fraer said.\nStudents will continue to engage with healthy eating thanks to curriculum provided by the University of Maryland Extension Program. The Food and Nutrition Services' dietitian is preparing marinated vegetables, roasted carrot fries and cheesy cauliflower for the students' lunches this month. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The $1.1 million contract was passed unanimously.\nShafer said some preliminary work will be done this spring before school ends. The school play and other concerts or events won't be impacted, Shafer said.\nOver in Cordova, the under-renovation Chapel District Elementary School will receive glazing for its new windows. The window glazing is a security film, Shafer said, a safety measure that \"prevents easy access to the school building.\"\nAll other schools in the district have the window glazing.\nChapel District Elementary is currently under renovation, a multimillion endeavor expected to be done sometime in 2026.\nThe contract is through a Maryland Center for School Safety grant in the amount of $132,000 for the window glazing. Shafer said the district couldn't move forward with it during construction of the renovated school building due to cost limits during the bidding process.\nShafer said he hopes the window security upgrades can be completed this summer. The board unanimously approved the contract.\nBoard President Emily Jackson added that she has \"slight hesitations about privacy\" as it relates to windows in classrooms and libraries at Chapel District Elementary and other schools.\nJackson asked that the board hear more about potential school safety grants in the future, particularly \"in the privacy arena to provide more screening for our students.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

On this particular afternoon, the children were making Halloween decorations and doing arts and crafts.The Cambridge Empowerment Center is a non-profit located on historic Pine Street, offers after school, summer learning and pre-school programs, hosts food drives, clothing drives, food distributions, senior health and enrichment programs, learning seminars and more.\nDirector of Children's Programs Tammy Washington oversees programs from pre-kindergarden through 13 years old. The pre-K program is free and runs from 9 a.m. to noon. Washington said there are slots available for this program. Those interested may sign up on the website.\nThe after-school programming runs from 3-6 p.m. with themed days including math, art and IXL, a subscription-based learning site. In addition to the educational programming, the children get a meal and a snack after school.\nThe summer program costs $125 for six weeks and offers breakfast and lunch, field trips, education and a tennis program and an additional cost with licensed child care providers.\nOne of the third grade children who attends the after-school program said she loves coming to the center and enjoys multiplication, reading, painting and learning about Harriet Tubman. Her favorite book is \"Llama Llama Mad at Mama.\"\nThe center opened in 2003 and has been licensed for child care for two years. Previous to the pandemic, the empowerment center solely operated through donations and via volunteers. Now, it runs on grant funding in addition to donations. Staff are paid and certified to work with children though they still welcome volunteers.\n\"After the pandemic, we started all over again,\" board member Julia Barker said. \"We had to reinvent ourselves.\"\nThe center is hosting an open house on Nov. 9 for community members to check out this reinvention. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
